Sawbones

Natasha
 
 

One of them had impaled her.

Her side burned at the reminder. The punch of the blade pushing through her flesh, the near razor smoothness hadn’t hurt at all. It was like it happened to someone else, but she’d felt the blood rush from her body, the ice spreading through her extremities and she’d stared down at the bridge aware that she was all that had stood between Pepper and being taken.

Then Pepper had screamed.

 

 

“It is important that you complete the trials.”

“Yeah? What trials? His little Mandarin House of Horrors?” She took another bite.

“It is a trial of the dragon.”

“Well the dragon can shove it up his snout,” she told him, then took another bite.

“I’m afraid you don’t understand. You have been chosen for this honor.” Yeah, it felt like she’d been chosen. “To embrace the dragon is to know wisdom and grace, to be admitted to the halls of the worthy…”

“Are you sure you’re not Asgardian? Cause I’ll tell you what I told him—I don’t need the answer to that question.”

 

 

 “What life does your master want?”

The monk blinked at her slowly.

“Or should I ask you what you want?”

The man’s smile grew. “You are the worthiest of opponents, Widow.” The monk passed his hand over his face and the features shifted and changed. Then The Mandarin stared at her. “What betrayed me?”

“You were playing it a little too heavy-handed. The monk before never lifted his hands from his legs.” No, he had sat rock still, his formal language never varying. This one… close, but no cigar.

The Mandarin smiled. “Very observant.” He glanced around the room. “You have created a difficulty for me.”

“Really?” She finished wiping her fingers and tossed the cloth back onto the tray. She began to flex the muscles in her legs to warm them. He knelt between her and the open door. He wasn’t shackled, not to mention, he looked well-rested. “Sucks to be you.”

“If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.” 

“Did you get your copy of The Art of War in the embossed illustrated version or the Cliffs’ Notes?”

Smiling, The Mandarin eyed her. “Your tongue is almost as cutting as your blades.”

“I hear I’ve got a talented one, shame to waste it.” He won their last fight because he used something to hold her still. The rings on his hands, one for each finger, drew the eye but he didn’t shift his posture as he settled his hands against his thighs.

“I hoped that by engaging you, I could persuade you to continue. The game—after all—requires two players.”

“But I’m not the player in your game, am I?” She challenged him. “You put me here as the pawn…”

“…and the prize,” he reminded her. “Better I think than what Tony Stark took from me in the first place. But it is not a victory until I have won it.”

“So…it really pisses on your day that I don’t want to play anymore? Damn, I can’t tell you how broken up about that I am.”

The Mandarin sighed. “I had really rather hoped to keep this civil.”

She didn’t scoff. She didn’t have time to. He flung out his hand and lightning struck her. The sizzle of it rolled over her even as her system jerked and she slammed her head back against the wall. The metal in her hand heated and the shocks rolled over her.

Still buzzing, she looked up as he rose. “This could have one much easier, but perhaps this will be a lesson for both of you.”

Lightning crawled over her. Shocking. Burning. Twisting.

 
 
 “I don’t suppose you have a gun?” It was a pointless question for Remy.

“I don’t like guns, Boo. Besides—you got me. I’m better than any gun.”

The corridor seemed empty, the chain of rooms going on through a couple of doorways. “Stay together. Cover Tony.”

“Red…”

She flicked her fingers at both of them. “Cover Tony, I’ll take care of me. Get him out. That’s the first priority.”

“Romanoff… you and me? That talk. It’s not going to be fun.”

She snorted. “Shellhead, we make it out of here, you can say anything you want to me. But you have to be alive to say it.”

 
 
Not wasting time, she checked her four. All dead. Remy’s still had a pulse, she didn’t waste time, she just snapped the downed monk’s neck then moved to the one Tony had set down.

“Red…”

“Not leaving them behind us.” She met his gaze fiercely. “Move, Tony.”

“This isn’t you,” he tried.

But she snorted and put a foot on either side of the man’s downed head, gripped with her ankles and twisted. His neck snapped as she held Tony’s gaze. “This is exactly who I am.”
  The brush of fingers against her shoulder catapulted Natasha from a nightmare to attack, she gripped the hand touching her, an
