Tony is six when he builds his first robot. He’s tinkered with other gadgets before, of course, but they were never actually real, never -- he never named them, anyway.Capper (because even at six Tony has a Captain America crush twenty leagues wide) is a cannibalized alarm clock, lamp, and toy car; he has little motorized treads and fetches Tony’s pens when Tony loses them around the room.Howard opens the door on Cap, knocking him to pieces. Tony makes an involuntary noise but his father just frowns at him.Cap never quite works the same way again, no matter how much Tony tries to repair him.

Tony’s inventions are always he. It’s a thing -- most of his cars are referred to as she of course, as is usual, but anything he builds and codes with his own two hands, from scratch, is male.And we remake the world in our own image, Obie tells him when he’s fifteen and brilliant and entirely stupid.Yeah. Tony remakes the world, one project at a time, and doesn’t even know if it’s a good thing.He loves his machines, though. They’re more real than most of the people he meets.

Dummy is actually a bit of an accident. Tony decides that he’s tired of leaving his coffee somewhere on the other side of the lab, groping blindly at thin air to come up with nothing, and then having to get up and find the beautiful ambrosia of wakefulness in a cup. Halfway through the planning process Dummy also gains basic lab safety protocols and behavioral tics, because: why the fuck not? If somebody is going to fetch his coffee, they had better have some sort of personality.Tony thinks he may be slightly screwed in the head, but then he remembers Reed Richards and dismisses the thought.

“Jarvis, you love me, right?”“Indubitably, sir.”

It takes him three years to even get Jarvis working, even his skeleton already one of the most complicated AI programs in existence. But there’s no point in barking orders without a reply (he finds that he expects a sassy one, he’s obviously too used to Pepper) and so for a week he holes himself up in the lab typing until his eyes can’t focus, sleeping in his cot and drinking coffee by the carafe-full.Actually, this may explain some of Jarvis’ personality quirks. Tony codes the finishing touches after thirty-six hours without sleep, manic and intent.No matter. A person can create somebody, literally, whether with genetic material or metal and wire, but nobody can control the way they develop. Look at him; his father always wished he were different.So Tony has daddy issues. He tries not to think about it.

“I will fry your circuits, dunk you in salt-water, the only thing your motherboard will be good for is a coffee coaster, I am not joking put that down right now.”Dummy winds down with a sad whir, and Tony decidedly does not feel guilty. He didn’t even program emotional simulators in Dummy.Two days later, a horrible thought surfaces when Jarvis says something offhand about knowledge being viral.Oh god, what if Jarvis infected Dummy with, with emotions. Jesus Christ.

---
“How ‘bout I check you out, huh? Do a little oiling on the joints, that kind of thing. Jarvis, shut up, I can feel your sarcasm. Dummy--Dummy, put down the fire extinguisher, it’s just a tune up!”

---
Tony never feels guilty about taking his inventions apart, mostly because he puts them back together better afterwards. Jarvis is one of the only exceptions, because he’s, well, he’s done. Certainly capable of running his own maintenance and routine updates.“What? Oh, really?” he says when Jarvis tells him they need more memory. “Okay, yeah, sure I’ll buy some more. What for?”“My routine back up of all processes is taking up more space than expected,” Jarvis informs him. This is news to Tony, who blinks.“Aren’t you saving over yourself?”“Indeed, the earliest versions of my software are woefully out of date. However, I thought it prudent to preserve more current copies, particularly with the addition of the Iron Man armor.”“Always thinking ahead, Jarvis,” says Tony, secretly freaking out a little. Jarvis is concerned with mortality now? With memory? Seriously? “Order the stuff online, you know what you want.”“Very good, sir.”Sentient machines, Tony thinks. More trouble than they’re worth.

“Wow, that is a really terrible idea,” Tony says to the air of his lab. “That is so stupid, Tony, don’t do it, drop it now.”“Are you talking to yourself again, sir?”“Yes. Shut up. I can talk to myself if I want. Heh, literally if I finish this project.”“Of course. By the way, Miss Potts is currently walking down the stairs. You have a meeting in fifteen minutes, apparently.”“Tell her I told you to tell her to reschedule.”“Tell her yourself, sir.”“You traitor,” Tony has time to hiss before Pepper clacks in with her four-inch heels, all ruthless efficiency. “Miss Potts, how lovely to see you, tell the board--”“No, Tony, you’ve put off the meeting twice already, you are going.”“But Pepper,” Tony whines. It’s a token protest; he kn
