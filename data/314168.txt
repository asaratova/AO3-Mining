It took only seven days for Tony to fall irrationally, pathetically, and completely in love with Steve Rogers."He's barely been around for a week and you already want to get in his pants," Pepper scolded as Tony watched Steve pummel a punching bag from across the gym. He'd decided their business check-in meetings would be conducted there after he figured out that Steve used exercise as a way to zone out of reality. And while he was a little concerned about that whole reasoning, he couldn't resist a sweaty Captain America."I don't want to get in his pants," Tony protested. After a beat he corrected, "I don't just want to get in his pants."Tony didn't know how to categorize Steve Rogers, and Tony knew how to categorize everything. Pepper insisted otherwise because the compulsion had no physical manifestation, but he had everything laid out in neat boxes in his mind. People and wine preferences and side projects all had their own subcategories and sections and levels. The other Avengers were in 'People I would trust with my life but not necessarily the lives of people I care about'. Pepper was in 'People I trust with everything', though it really should be re-titled into 'Person', as there were no other members.Steve was in the 'Person I want to open up my chest for and show him everything inside and hope that he might feel something for me, whom I respect so much I'm almost in awe of him and would definitely like to have sex with but refuse to be anything other than serious and committed to him in a ridiculously girlish fit of romanticism' group, which hadn't even existed until a week ago."This is the most infatuated I've seen you since you bought the Saleen," Pepper observed, holding out a leaflet of documents for him to sign."He's a beautiful car and I had to have him," Tony replied. He signed the papers absently, not even close to the lines with some of them as Steve stopped for a moment to sit down on a bench to re-wrap his hands. Steve seemed to get along fine with the rest of the Avengers, friendly and unfailingly polite whenever drawn into a conversation, but he hadn't made any move to reach out on his own yet. Tony had been tracking the activity on Steve's personal computer, and when it wasn't things like 'how a smartphone works', it was history sites, looking up past wars and seeing that the world hadn't changed that much since he was around, despite all his efforts.(Tony wasn't stalking Steve. At least, not any more than he was stalking the others. But it had been his tower before the Avengers had moved in, and he liked to at least pretend that he still had some kind of power. Besides, he was just making sure that Steve wasn't looking up anything like sites on 'How Superhumans Can Commit Suicide Because They've Been Dead for Seventy Years And Now Their Entire Life is Gone'.)"I thought the Saleen was a 'she'," Pepper pointed out. Tony shrugged one shoulder."Only when it's being a bitch."Pepper's lips twitched and she retrieved the documents, tucking them neatly back into the folder. She then leveled Tony with the Look: the one that could stop grown men in their tracks for fear of being smacked across the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. It forced him to drag his gaze away from the band of skin between Steve's shirt and shorts and actually turn his head to look her in the eye."I'll be back from Los Angeles in a week," she said. "Don't do anything monumentally insane before I get back, alright?""Of course," Tony replied with a reassuring smile. Once Pepper was gone he turned his attention back to Steve, who was sitting with his head in his hands and made Tony's heart twist just from looking at him.Three days and two sleepless nights later he was onboard a newly-designed jet bound for Western Europe, to search for a man long considered dead.  James Barnes wore a tattered blue outfit that had clear 1940s roots but with a twist: stronger and lighter material, with a flair akin to the uniform Steve had been found in—which, of course, meant the hand of Dad. Barnes was young, tall, dark-haired and handsome, with a pouty downturn to his lips that Tony suspected was a permanent fixture.He was also frozen completely solid after spending seventy years buried beneath twenty yards of snow and ice.Unreasonably, Tony found himself more concerned with the former than the latter.- …I don't think we can save his arm, at least not with any level of original functioning—sir, are you listening to me? -"Of course I am," Tony replied automatically, tearing his eyes away from Barnes' nude body to blink at the display monitors. They'd had to cut off the uniform in order to better treat the whole 'frozen' thing, and Barnes was currently suspended in a tank filled with perfluorocarbon fluid, a breathable liquid that could warm him from the inside-out.- Please don't tell me you're more concerned ogling Sergeant Barnes than you are reviving him, sir. -"I am not ogling," Tony said loftily. "I am ascertaining the damage t
