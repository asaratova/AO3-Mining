Work Text:
Maddy tapped a random line of the manuscript. “’The wicked vizier laughed menacingly as he contemplated the fair lady’s dire straights…’ Don’t you think you should tone it down a little? He’s dead, after all.” St. John shrugged. “And the man in the book has a different name.” “Everyone’s still going to know who it is. What with the way you keep talking about his ‘tarnished silver tongue’ and ‘knee-length amber hair’—and by the way, if you were anyone else I’d comment on your restraint in not calling it flame-colored— anyway, Cortez was in with the Cove, but this fellow’s in the pay of three foreign governments and meanwhile planning his own palace coup and scheming after this poor girl’s virtue. Aren’t you overdoing it a bit?”“Who’s going to mind? The ladies of the capitol hated Cortez, and the rest know him as a traitor.” St. John grinned at her over his lit pipe. “It’d be positively seditious not to treat him as the base villain he was.” “I somehow doubt Viceroy du Paris actually reads your books.”“You never know. And anyway, Cargill does. I don’t want the viceroy’s right-hand woman reporting me for sedition, do I?” She rolled her eyes, but she laughed.
