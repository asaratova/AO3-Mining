Chapter Text
It had been a long time since you'd met with those Doctor's and established you were, as they say, a 'Schizophrenic'. It had also been a long time since you'd started caring about what you saw, heard and felt on a daily basis. It was the same weird unknown day-in-day-out. But one day, something caught your eye and you wondered if it was really Schizophrenia or in fact just a blatant obviousness that you were able to see nit only your hallucinations... but others' as well.Because, it's not everyday you would see your strangely admirable Doctor themed as the white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, but when you did it was almost like a warning... You hadn't seen him in a long time and now you were seeing how a tall, mummified bird bitch was following around a middle-aged man in a tartan shirt and even going to the lengths of following him into an Egyptian display at a neighbouring museum. So, like... Come on, you're seriously intrigued by now aren't you? Cuz I bloody well am.You sigh, alling your fists in frustration after realising how you'd be late for work if you followed up this lead, but no matter because you did it anyway.You made your way across the street and smiled at the guy in the CCTV section, what you hadn't expected was for him to wink grossly back, you were just being nice... is courtesy wrong or something in this part of the world? To be fair, living in the Countryside of England for so long was lovely and everyone smiled at everyone - except for the townies - BAM, that's what it is, depressed town's folk don't understand an innocent smile as a hello... Weird.Anyway-You wandered all throughout the exhibit, interested with every fine detail. The guy in the tartan shirt came over with a young girl and showed her how the organs were taken out of the body with a long metal hook. It sounded... interesting.The girl stayed around for a while then skipped off and left the man to the mercy of his boss. She was a total Karen. 'No, she's a Brittney... or should I say, Britttnaaaaay~'You shook your head, trying to shut the voice up.'You're gonna give us vertigo if you keep doing that... Plus, you're the anaemic one, you'll be out first!'  "Shh." You whispered conspicuously to the voice in your head. You pretended to be looking at the glass container with the sarcophagus inside it."Are you al'r'ight?" The boss lady asked you.  "Hubujabbegga, no speak ingles!" You stuttered out on the spot and slip out from beside the bitchy Londoner.The boss made a face the went back to working.You watched from behind the sarcophagus cabinet and saw as the guy was working on scanning sweets and stuff, talked to a woman who was very pretty and then left him talking about a date or something. You shuffled out from your spot and went to leave when out of the corner of your eye, you saw the sweets were in fact sour strings! You slammed your hands on the table, bringing a little too much attention to yourself. You ducked a little but it didn't relent the crowd of eyes on your frame.The guy at the counter ducked with you and asked in a whisper, "D'you wann-oo buy somethin'?"   "Yes please, I would like a bag of sarcohpagus innards, rainbow one please." You smiled with your face against the glass surface."Sure thing, 20p please." He smiled, leaning over the desk still, hand out for the coin and the other with the bag, sliding it across the counter for you. You took out the 20p, forgot what you were doing and put your hand in his. He looked at your hand and stuttered, "Sorry, uhh w-what are you doing?"   "Don't know.." You narrowed your eyes, looked at the sweets, saw the mirror image of the guy but he looked angrier than his real face. You were 'schizo-ing' again - as you liked to call it. You slapped the 20p to the table top, took the bag of sweets and sprinted for the exit.The guy blinked and in the mirror image of him, the other version of him squinted his eyes with caution.~A few days later, you had followed the guy to his flat and when you walked down a hallway the lights began to flicker, you didn't understand but it was that beaky bitch again. You saw a flash of him and instead being as fearful as you probably should have been, you just made a beeline for the elevator. Meeting an old woman along the way, you helped her along, pulling her bag as she used her hand to keep the elevator open.The guy was in the corner, screaming and falling down the floor. He claimed to have lost his contact lens, the old lady was obviously shaken and repulsed by the 'druggie' she had pressumed of the man. You turned to l
