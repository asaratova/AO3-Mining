Chapter 1





Chapter Text

Peter flopped down on his bed with a groan, pulling out his phone to text his best friend.

 From Peter: 

That was the absolutely worst date ever! Whatever made you think I’d like THEM?!


 Peter hit send, fiddling with the phone a moment before he thought of something else to send.

 From Peter: 

you’re so grounded from setting me up with people.


 He hit send again before typing once more.

 From Peter

: I mean it! GROUNDED!


 He sent that and tossed his phone to the side, satisfied with the amount of annoyance he was showing at his best friend.  Recently his boyfriend had dumped him, in hindsight, it was for the best, he wasn’t a very nice guy and Peter was a people pleaser. The thing about this guy was that he was never pleased! He always had something negative to say to or about Peter and Peter thought everything was his fault which it obviously wasn’t.

 Well his best friend Ned had been setting him up with blond dates for weeks, this one was the worst. Peter groaned just thinking of the dates he’s been on, they all ended awfully, he hated Ned.
 
Tony blinked down at his phone, chuckling at the apparent rage coming through over text. He had no idea who it was, but he figured he could have some fun.

 From Tony

: do I get time off for good behavior?


 Peter’s phone almost tumbled from his hands. The hell? He thought.

 From Peter: 

Um are you sick?

 

He sent back quickly and Tony grinned, flipping his feet onto his table, leaning back to settle in.

 From Tony: 

not that I'm aware of why?


Peter shook his head.

From Peter

: Never mind. You’re not getting out of this shit storm you’ve created, I had to leave through the bathroom window!


He typed quickly with a huff

From Tony: 

that bad huh?


Peter frowned.

From Peter: 

YES!


He responded.

From Peter

: I hate you.


He added as an afterthought.

From Tony

: fun, considering I haven’t even met you


From Peter

:  You’re not funny, Ned. That date really sucked

.

Tony was delighted, laughing loudly and waving off Peppers look from where she was doing paperwork.

From Tony: 

who is Ned? I'm sorry your date sucked.


Peter looked at his phone and checked the number, he was positive Ned was just screwing with him, but sure enough, it wasn’t Ned’s number just his name. Peter flushed before responding.

From Peter

: I am so sorry, I tried to.... enhance....my phone and it must have messed some names and numbers up.


Tony frowned, looking at his phone in confusion.

From Tony

: enhance? How so?


Peter flushed even more even though the other person couldn’t see him.

From Peter: 

I had a few ideas....but I don’t exactly have the best tools laying around, hence the number issue.


Tony was interested now, absently bringing up a holo-screen.

From Tony

: ideas like what? I'm curious.


Peter shook his head.

From Peter

: I wouldn’t want to bore you, most people kinda zone out when I start talking about technology.


From Tony: 

promise I won’t.


Peter bit his lip, deciding if he should tell this person his ideas or not, with a shrug he started to text back.

From Peter: 

I um...well.. for one...


Peter ended up texting the person one of the longest text messages he thinks he’s ever sent and it probably looked like gibberish to the person on the other end but he didn’t care, it was nice to have someone interested enough to even ask.

Tony blinked in genuine surprise at some of the ideas. Oh, he liked this. He leaned forward, furiously typing on the holoscreen.

From Tony

: those would definitely be improvements! Is there anything appearance wise you’d change?


Peter thought for a moment before responding, sending different size specs for the screen, and different colors that would be popular, along with his personal favorite, the deep red with a gold outline for the screen before hitting send

Tony’s eyebrows rose. "Hey, Pep, come see this" he called, flicking the prototype pictures of the phones up into a bigger holoscreen.

From Tony: 

the red one WOULD be amazing. What's your name anyway?


Pepper walked over, eyebrow raised “Where did you get these....you know what? Never mind, they look great.” She settled on, she’d learned long ago not to ask her best friend about a project, she’d be there for hours. Peter smiled at the text before responding.

From Peter: 

Right! It’s my favorite colors.


He sent, forgetting to answer the question.

From Peter: 

I’m Peter.


Tony just grinned at Pepper, waving his phone. "Wrong number text from someone that had been tinkering with his phone." He offered.

From Tony: 

Hello Peter. I'm Tony


 

Oh, hell no, Tony wasn’t going to say his last name, he didn’t want to change his number... AGAIN.

From Peter: 

Nice to meet you! It’s nice having someone I can spew tech babble and not completely bore them.


From Tony: 

tech lingo is my first language. Taught to me at my nanny's knee.


Peter laughed.

From Peter

: I’m so ready to get to MIT. I need to be am
