Chapter 1: Hello There (M/N)
    




Chapter Text
Maria Hill stands at the off ramp of the jet with her arms crossed. Of all the stupid things Barton can do, he goes off mission. Worse of all, Coulson agrees with him and now she’s stuck with their combined stupidity. She doesn’t have to look at her watch to know they’re late. Maria’s been waiting for them to arrive for the past 5 minutes, and she’s got better things to do. For instance, commanding an entire Helicarrier since Fury is off doing God only knows what at the Triskelion, leaving her to be the welcome wagon for the famous Black Widow.Another two minutes and finally, she sees her least favorite agent strutting down the ramp, of course he’s sleeveless, showing off his arms. A few paces behind him is Coulson, stoic as ever, only a small tic at the corner of his mouth shows his amusement. Last but not least is of course Black Widow.She’s younger in person, Maria notes. Even with a bruised and bloody face, she’s beautiful. Maria stamps down her ogling and nearly rolls her eyes at the handcuffs. With her skills, Black Widow probably already has them unlocked.“Agent Barton, Agent Coulson,” Maria greets breezily.“It was my idea,” Barton says.“Of course Barton, only you would be this idiotic.”Barton doesn’t take offense to that, instead just grins boyishly to Maria’s annoyance.Maria sweeps her eyes up and down Black Widow when they all stop in front of her. Her fingers twitch against her gun.“She’s clean,” Clint says, noticing Maria’s movement. “I checked myself.”Maria does roll her eyes this time and locks her gaze with Black Widow’s, not backing down even with the blank stare she gets in return.“You missed the switchblade embedded into her belt,” Maria says to the Black Widow.Black Widow focuses on her so quickly and intently on Maria has the sudden urge to flinch at the end of her sentence. It doesn’t help the feeling once Black Widow grins, all teeth. Black Widow slowly reaches to the edge of her belt, pulling out the hidden knife and placing it in Coulson’s outstretched palm.“Tanto neck knife, actually.”Maria loses her composure for half a second, enough for anyone with any spy training to see her shock. It isn’t the fact that Maria was actually joking about the hidden weapon but what Black Widow said. She’s been waiting to hear those words for her entire life and never could she have imagined them to be said today.“Crap,” Maria hisses. She has the urge to hit her head against a solid object, repeatedly.Black Widow’s smile gets even wider and her eyes shine with happiness, leaving Barton and Coulson looking on in confusion. She licks her fingers, rolling her sleeves up and rubs her moist fingers against a patch of smooth skin on her inner forearm.Not even Maria could deny it now, tattooed on her arm is Maria’s first sentence.Coulson breaks composure first, a sharp intake of breath while Barton curses under his breath.“Where’s yours?” Black Widow asks.Maria sighs and partially unzips her jumpsuit, pulling at the collar. The irony of the words aren’t lost on anyone, they’re embedded on her shoulder right next to her neck.Black Widow nods her head. “Natasha Romanoff,” she introduces herself. When Maria doesn’t answer, Natasha pouts. “It’s a bit rude to not introduce yourself to your soul mate. I’m going to have to call you pretty-blue-eyes if you don’t.”“Maria Hill.”Natasha smirks. “Pleasure to meet you, Maria.”She tamps down the fire that shoots through her stomach. Natasha saying her name shouldn’t have that effect. “So, you should be thanking me for not taking the shot now right?” Barton interrupts.Maria shoots him a glare until he withers under it. Maybe Barton should’ve taken the shot. As if her life wasn’t complicated enough, she’s now soul mates with the world’s top assassin who’s just defected to SHIELD. Maria feels the pangs of a headache starting. The paperwork is going to be massive.
