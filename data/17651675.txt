Chapter 1: They Came For Him
    




Chapter Text
They came for him when he was going to school. Of course they would; Peter has been late or absent from school many times, so it shouldn't be that much of a shock to people that he doesn’t show up again.They came for him when he was walking a block to get to the subway, using the choice spot to not be seen by cameras.They knew what they were doing.They came for him, and they had him.They poked him with nails, shoved knives into his body, and bashed his head in for three days.On the third day, he snapped.Something happened during that final healing process, slower than normal due to the lack of food and water. His brain healed again, for the fourth time, and it would've been like the others, but then he couldn't remember.Peter couldn't remember.The pain he was in caused him to break away.What is that? He thought as his hands stuck to the man's shirt as he held him four feet in the air.No matter how hard he scrubbed for the next four days, it wouldn't come off his hands and feet. His skin came off when he really tried but each layer of skin—the old that he couldn’t bring himself to get past, and the new that grows back before he can even try—has that layer of stickiness.The first man he left in a metal box that had holes in it. They had transported him in that, like a rabid dog that is too dangerous to touch, but he was unconscious for most of it, and he doesn’t remember, anyway.He only knows because he can smell the scent that surrounds his blood all over it.The first woman was left hanging in a net of webbing that he made using some devices that shot webs.Peter took the devices, too afraid to leave them with the kidnappers, but he didn't keep them; he was too afraid of trackers to keep them, so, he kept them for the time being, at least until he could destroy them.The second man was tied with a collar that was used to electrocute him. Peter broke it so that it would no longer shock anyone, and he tied the man’s hands with zipties.The second woman was in the stand that had kept Peter immobile, tied to it for days, beaten and stabbed, but he left her there, not a single mark on her.Peter left his kidnappers there, and then he ran.
