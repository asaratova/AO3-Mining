xxx You're a troublemaker
You're a troublemaker...
You ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girlYou had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I'll have the strength to stand, oh oh oh...Trouble troublemaker, yeah
That's your middle name, oh oh oh...
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know...Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad, oh oh oh?
My mind keeps saying,
"Run as fast as you can"
I say, "I'm done," but then you pull me back, oh oh oh...
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker!It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see your silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
'Cause I keep comin' back again for more, oh oh oh...Trouble troublemaker, yeah
That's your middle name, oh oh oh...
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know...Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad, oh oh oh?
My mind keeps saying,
"Run as fast as you can"
I say, "I'm done," but then you pull me back, oh oh oh...
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker xxx Tony, being Tony Stark: self named billionaire, genius, playboy and philanthropist, did frequent bars often so it was not an unusual sight to see him at one of the snazzy bars sipping a highly alcoholic drink tapping away at his phone or watching the other inhabitants of the bar.So on one of his examines of the room he couldn’t fail to notice a lithe figure cut across the room heading more or less to where Tony was sat. Tony shamelessly eyeballed the young man noting his aristocratic facial shape, messy black hair and enthralling slanted green eyes. The green eyed man, looking just into his early twenties stalked gracefully to a seat near Tony’s.The man moved sensuously, edgily, like a predator all coiled muscles ready to tense in less than a split second. The crowd parted for the new comer almost instinctively, eyes following the figure nearly involuntarily. There was something about the man that drew the eyes, a near visible charisma, something more than the obvious charm from his extraordinary good looks.As he drew closer to Tony, Tony briefly thought of the ozone and lightning, uncontrolled, unpredictable, fickle and mostly full of pure power.The man had an almost crackling odd aura. It screamed dangerous. Tony leaned back casually in interest not relenting in his intense stare.Green eyes slid into the bar stool with an economy of movement Tony would have said was impossible.The man ordered a whiskey and immediately swallowed the entire glass of the burning liquid without a wince at the burn. Tony ran a tongue over his teeth and decided to do something he rarely indulged in, he decided to watch the man instead of going over to him right away, Tony was not, after all, famed for his patience.Tony also drained his glass ordering another, his tally reaching six of the highly alcoholic shots, it was a good thing he could hold his liquor so well. Or maybe it showed the amount of time he spent in bars and drinking. Tony shrugged draining another, he didn’t care either way.Tony watched as another bloke, average looking brown hair, blue eyes, approached the enigmatic figure sitting elegantly in the bar stool. Something about green eyes posture reminded Tony of Natasha Romanov. Another dangerous predator.Tony watched amused as the brown haired man was constantly rebuffed for all his efforts with the green eyed man. The brown haired man however was getting more and more frustrated as his efforts continued to fail. It was when the brown haired man placed a hand on the green eyed ones shoulder that Tony tensed in an unnamable emotion, something a bit like trepidation...but that was silly because Tony never ever felt anything like trepidation.Green eyes expression had blanked, gone was the slight irritation mingled with a tiny bit of amusement.The brown haired mans grip tightened slightly not noticing the other mans expression and green eyes made his move. With speed that was unparalleled the green eyed man fluidly stood, kicked the brown haired mans legs from under him while simultaneously sticking his elbow into the nose of the man who had fallen from the painful kick to his knees.Tony watched as green eyes, not looking even remotely ruffled at taking down a man that was more bulky than himself, unconcernedly walk around the man whimpering on the floor clutching his nose and ignoring the blood gushing, grabbing the browned haired mans drink and downing it throwing down some money on the bar before leaving disregarding the stares on his back.Tony followed him out but by the time he had managed to get past the crowds, who didn’t part as instinctively for him as they did for green eyes, the messy haired man had disappeared.Tony cursed.He hadn’t even gotten the green eyed mans name. He didn’t know whether to feel relieved or
