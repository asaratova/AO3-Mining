1. Mjolnir
Thor is told, not long after meeting him, that Tony Stark used to design weapons.  This does not come as much of a surprise to Thor, since Tony has been eyeing Mjolnir covetously since he first faced the hammer in battle.  During a quiet moment on the helicarrier, when they were waiting for the Midgardian science to detect the tesseract, Tony actually emerged from his lab and strolled over to Thor casually, his gaze fixed on Thor's waist.Without even asking, he ran his index finger over the face of the hammer, which was hanging at Thor's belt.  Thor frowned, confused."So how's this thing work, then, magic?"  The way he said magic was strange to Thor.  It was the way one would speak of a mythical beast."If you like," Thor replied, catching Tony's wrist in his hand and pulling it away from Mjolnir.  Tony looked up and met his eyes.  "Asgardian science is, I believe, beyond Earth understanding, and so you call it magic."If Thor had known then what he came to know later, if he had known Tony as well as he would after fighting beside him in countless battles and sitting beside him at countless meals, after bleeding and laughing and drinking with him – if Thor had known Tony, he would have known better than to say that.  At the time, however, he had mistaken Tony's reaction to Thor's statement for arrogance, mistaken the gleam in Tony's eye for a reaction to an imagined slight."I am sorry, I meant no disrespect," Thor had hastily added.  "Only that I do not think Mjolnir can be explained in terms that will make sense to you.""Uh huh," Tony said, and though his hand was unmoving and acquiescent in Thor's grip Thor somehow could sense that he wanted to touch again; that if Thor let go, Tony's hand would fly straight back to press against the cool metal in an echo of the manner in which the hammer flew, when called, to meet Thor's grip.Just then Bruce stepped out from their workshop and raised an eyebrow at Tony.  "We're ready for the next sweep," he said, apparently choosing not to remark on the odd position he found them in, standing close together, Thor still holding Tony's wrist."Of course," Tony agreed, looking into Thor's eyes appraisingly.  Thor had been appraised by bigger men than Tony Stark, and so he just smiled, amused.Tony had returned to his lab and never mentioned it again during their subsequent battle, and so Thor thought the issue had been resolved.After the battle, after Loki's capture and his return to Asgard for imprisonment, after Thor had discharged his duties there and returned to Midgard again – that is when the intense questioning starts."So you channel the lightning how, exactly? Is there a particular command you do, a motion you make to activate it?""And it imparts how much force to its target? If it can knock over the Hulk, even temporarily, but can't break Steve's shield . . . ""So, what, it's just movable under some circumstances and immovable under others?" This last one leads to even more frustration and disbelief on Tony's part when he learns that there had been a time when even Thor himself had not been able to lift the hammer."I was unworthy," Thor explains gravely.  "It does not select for my – my DNA, as you call it, but rather for my strength of spirit.  My father's way of ensuring that the weapon is never wielded by one unfit to do so."Tony blinks twice, mouth falling open, and there it is again, that gleam in his eye that Thor spotted when Tony first ran his finger over the hammer's perfect gleaming face."Worthy," he says, after a moment, with a sneer.  "You know, we should find a way to program that into Earth weapons.""I have often had this thought myself, yes.  Was it not this same compulsion toward the moral deployment of weapons that led you to become the Iron Man?"At this, Tony's eyes shutter, and he turns away; knowing Tony now better than he did before, Thor stops him with a hand on his arm."Yeah, well, my dad didn't really think about power the same way yours did.  On Earth we pretty much just acquire it.""Tony," Thor says slowly, "you have proven yourself worthy on many occasions, and I am honored to fight by your side.  You use your power to improve Midgard and protect the innocent."Tony's eyebrow quirks, and he sighs.  "Still can't lift that morality-detecting superhammer of yours, though, can I?""I have yet to learn of anyone, other than myself, who can."The experiments go on; Thor allows Tony to test Mjolnir in every way he can dream up, and Tony continues to display, alternately, frustration and fascination as he fails to understand it.  Thor tries to explain, where he can – he is not an expert in the craft of the Dwarves himself – but he still truly believes what he told Tony that first day: that it is beyond the understanding of Midgardian science.Eventually, Tony declares himself done with the project, and Thor, cautiously, breathes a sigh of relief, thinking that perhaps Tony could turn his time and attention to more productive and mor
