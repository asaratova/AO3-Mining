Chapter Text
Darcy Lewis hadn’t had a specific goal in mind when she applied to be Dr. Jane Foster’s lab assistant.  She wanted a break from classrooms, and since the option of earning 6 credits in the field was available to her, it seemed foolish not to take advantage of it.  Jane’s wasn’t the only internship she applied for--nor was it the only one she got--but when she did get it, she figured, why not?  It would broaden her horizons, she told anyone who questioned the wisdom of a poli-sci major aiding a physicist.She’d had no idea how broad her horizons could get.At the end of it, Darcy had her 6 credits, some money in her bank account (when S.H.I.E.L.D. had offered Jane funding, they had incorrectly assumed that Darcy was receiving a stipend for her work.  She had chosen not to correct them), and the heady knowledge that humans were so, so very not alone in the universe.  And that the aliens (gods, whatever) were hot and also, you know, bonkers.She also had some new friends.  When she’d begun her internship, she’d seen Jane as wooden and humorless.  Mainly because Jane was, frequently, wooden and humorless.  But then a giant Norseman had fallen out of the sky, and a whole lotta weirdness had followed.  It made Darcy look at Jane in a new light, and in the latter half of the semester, she’d even developed a fondness for the scientist.  She was serious and driven, but she was also awkward and sometimes funny and she’d fallen for an interdimensional god-alien-person, and Darcy could respect that insane level of foolishness.  They exchanged the odd email and phone call after Darcy returned to school.And Agent Coulson had dropped in on them a few times post-S.H.I.E.L.D. involvement, and Darcy loved that guy.  Not at first, of course, but when he returned her iPod, he complimented her on her music collection and there was no faster way into Darcy’s cold, black heart than that.  (“A fan of 90s chick rock, are you, Suit?” she asked.  In response, he’d quoted Letters to Cleo lyrics to her.)  He’d even shown up at her graduation a year later and offered her a job at S.H.I.E.L.D., and she thought that was a pretty solid thing for a guy to do.  She hadn’t taken it because she already had something lined up that was, you know, actually in her field, and it had been a transparent effort on the part of a shadowy government agency she was supposed to have no knowledge of to keep a close eye on her.  But still, sweet.  He’d brought her some flowers and charmed the pants off her mom.Not literally.Ew.Anyway, it was a pretty sweet note to begin her professional career on.  And then aliens invaded the island of Manhattan, and everything changed.  For everyone.
