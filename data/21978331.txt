Chapter 1: Saturday (NSFW)
    


Notes:
EDIT: So it's been brought to my attention (rightfully so) that my use of non-celebrity (basically non-RDJ or Chris Evans) people's faces in this fic is a problem. Which - even though I didn't use these images in a bad or sexual context - is absolutely valid. I've decided to blur all the faces in pictures of real life people in this fic (aside from those that are already a meme) to protect their privacy and also to prevent people from reverse google image searching these pictures. I know it sort of takes away from the realism of this fic but I think it's a good compromise. I apologize for not taking these precautions earlier and I sincerely hope that with this I prevent anyone from going after people's real identities (not that I think anyone would but it's good to be safe).Thank you so much for your comment, ladysunflower, and I hope you guys have fun reading this fic.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
