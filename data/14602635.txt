Chapter 1





Chapter Text

16 December 1991, New York City
  Howard aggressively hauled their bags toward the car waiting for them.Tony was once again being irritatingly difficult. His seventeen-year-old son had a talent for throwing the most passive-aggressive tantrum a teenager can ever throw. Another meaningless fight, at this point, it was almost reflexive. Howard and Tony have been doing this dance since Tony was shipped off to boarding school for his own good. But his son had somehow grown bitter in his time away, losing the inquisitive little boy that followed Howard everywhere and was replaced by a walking, breathing definition of a brat. Exposing Tony to the public and having access to unlimited credit cards did nothing to change his behavior. It intensified it, and Howard bore the brunt of Tony’s biting sarcasm. He felt exhausted and helpless in the wake of it and Howard couldn’t even blame him for it.Howard was well aware of how terrible he was at being a dad. Tony deserved more than what Howard can give, what Howard can express.The hurt that Tony desperately tried to hide each time Howard said something out of spite is proof enough that his son’s heart was nothing at all like his father’s. Howard Stark is a narcissistic, smart-ass, sarcastic bastard because he built himself that way. He had to, it was the only way to survive. But when Tony had been young, when Howard looked down and saw the beaming face of his son, saw the light that swirled inside those hopeful, dark brown orbs, he knew he had to build the world into something worthy of Tony. Because Tony was gentler than Howard, he was smarter, more loving, more understanding, more genuine—just more—than Howard can ever be.Tony was better than anything Howard had ever dreamt of. But somehow, Howard found a way to ruin his son anyway.It’s not like Howard couldn’t see where Tony was coming from, because he can. He has, he always will. But this didn’t mean that Howard can drop everything for Tony. The world he dreamed for his son rested on his shoulders and Howard cannot—ironically—sacrifice the fate of the world for Tony. It was the only way to ensure his son’s safety and to build him a brighter future.He sincerely hoped that this was something Tony would understand one day.Howard sighed, slamming the trunk with more force than warranted. Maria lingered inside, trying to appease a sulking Stark. Not the easiest job in the world but Maria had always been more than capable of calming that particular brewing storm. Sometimes, he envied Maria for her easy and loving relationship with Tony. But he was to content to know that if Tony couldn’t see Howard’s plans to protect him, he would always have his mother’s open love and affection.“Howard,” Maria called to him and something in her tone made Howard snap his head up to meet her eyes. But she was looking beyond Howard, eyes trained on the sleek, black car driving up their front lawn. Howard caught a glimpse of Peggy’s pursed lips and hard eyes and it instantly raised the hackles on Howard’s back.Something was wrong.Peggy didn’t even wait for the car to fully stop before she pushed the door open and walked quickly to where he and Maria stood.“Howard, you better come quickly,” she said, eyes drowned in fear. It was such an unusual sight, it took Howard off guard. “Something’s happened.”“What’s wrong, Peggy?” Maria asked gently, looking equally alarmed. Peggy answered with a shake of her head, unable to speak. Whatever happened has left Peggy unable to find the words to explain. Maria clutched Howard’s arm tightly. Peggy turned back to Howard.“Bring your family.” Peggy ordered, turning to leave but Howard gripped her arm, his eyes held a dangerous edge in them.“I thought we agreed Tony will not be a part of this until he’s older.” Howard hissed angrily. They had a deal: Tony was off limits to SHIELD unless Howard deemed him old enough to know.“He already is, Howard.” Peggy hissed back, twisting her arm out of his hold. “The fate of the world rests on him. It’s time for Tony to come in.”“Peggy, you’re not making any sense. What the hell are you talking about?” Howard snapped.“Miss Carter,” a voice greeted behind them. Howard nearly groaned. Tony sauntered toward them, his head curiously tilted to the side. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”“It’s good to see you, Anthony.” Peggy greeted tightly. “I was just telling your father that’s time for you to—”“Peggy!” Howard hissed. Tony will not be anywhere near SHIELD; over his dead body.“That’s interesting.” Tony commented, pointing at his father and looking like Howard had done something novel. Howard gritted his teeth in irritation.“Howard, there’s no choice!” Peggy snapped. There were tears in her eyes. “I understand that you want to protect your son but this involves all of us. If you want to protect your family, you have to let them come in.” Howard was once again so caught off guard by Peggy that it left him breathless. Each time he’d seen her emotionally
