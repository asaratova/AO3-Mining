Chapter 1: Eggsy Unwin x Reader
    




Chapter Text
You were sitting on a park bench in London as the evening sky helped you relax after a stressful day at work. You worked as an IT specialist for a local law firm. Today the whole network crashed as the electricity went out last night, and then with just your luck one of the partners had come in complaining about the network being down. It didn't help that the three other people you work with all oh so conveniently called in sick. It was a simple fix but it took forever doing it by yourself. By the time that you were done the other two partners and some of their higher ups walked in saying that they had important business to do. You ended up staying an hour and a half later due to it. Thus leading you to your favorite spot to relax after a stressful day. As you began to settle in to the bench a hand was placed on your shoulder jarring you from your thoughts at the sudden contact."Sorry, but is this seat taken?" The stranger asked."No. Let me just move my bag." You replied as you move you bag so he can sit."It's beautiful ain't it." He said once seated. I got my first good look at him. He was wearing a very nice suit, a pair of thick rimmed glasses, and carrying an umbrella as well as his suit jacket since it was a humid day out. Lastly I noticed that he had a pug with him."It is. What's your dog's name?" You asked him."JB""As in Jack Bauer?""How'd you know?" He questioned with a shocked grin on his face. A playful look in his eyes. His gorgeous brown eyes."You're talking to someone who watches way too much television for their own good." You smiled back as he laughed."What's your name?""(y/n) (l/n)""Unwin. Eggsy Unwin." He said as he stuck out his hand for a handshake. Now it was your turn to laugh, and he smiled even more at this. Eggsy was mesmerized by your features. From your (h/l) (h/c) to your (e/c) eyes that held a sparkle that he couldn't quite place what it was, enchanting him even more. It wasn't just your looks that attracted him. It was something else that made him walk over to you when there was plenty of other empty spots around you two."So Mr. Unwin what brings you here today?" You ask noting that he was clearly checking you out. So in return you shamelessly checked him out. From the way he did his hair to the way he was sitting. His suit jacket now off showed off his arms and the muscles hidden underneath. Did he have a six pack? Your eyes traveled back up to his face and to his lips. Plush and pink, and very kissable. The movement of said lips brought you out of you thoughts."I may have saw a beautiful girl sittin' all alone on this wonderful evening. Ms. (l/n).""Who would this lucky lady be?" You asked while looking into his eyes."She's absolutely stunning." Eggsy started and began to describe you in detail, but not to a creepy level. While doing this he thought how he just wanted to be close to you. No other girl has ever had this effect on him. The only logical way of doing so was to scoot closer to you on the bench, eventually closing the gap as your legs were brushing each other's."She sounds wonderful.""Cause she is.""Your pushin' it there Eggsy.""I'm pushin' what exactly Ms. (l/n)?" Eggsy nudged you leg with his and grinned from ear to ear flashing his beautiful smile."Hmph. I think you should ask her out before she has to go home." You said as he was surprised at your statement."Well then. (y/n) would you like to have a drink sometime soon?" He asked as you were now smiling in the same way that he was grinning earlier."I'd love that Eggsy." You said as the two of you exchanged numbers and went your separate ways after you said goodbye. Today wasn't so bad anymore thanks to Eggsy Unwin.
