Chapter Text
Peter was having a good week. Flash had been out sick and because of that, the world was a better place. Instead of feeling the constant dread of his Spidey-Sense alerting him to the danger that is his bully, he could walk down Midtown’s hallways in peace. To add to the greatness, Aunt May had received a once-in-a-lifetime nursing opportunity all the way in San Francisco, so Peter was staying at the Avengers Tower.  It wasn’t as if it was his first time staying there. It had always pretty much been his second home, and by this point all the Avengers had adopted him. He had even finally managed to call Mr. Stark Tony, much to Tony’s enjoyment. Spider-Man was having a good week as well. Nothing extraordinary had happened - the spandex-clad vigilante was simply helping the elderly cross the street, arms full of groceries, or occasionally nabbing a cat down from a treetop - the usual. But Spider-Man truthfully didn’t care how large-scale his help was; it simply felt good to swing around Queens and help the little guy. Unfortunately, Peter has terrible luck, and when the hair on his neck stuck up on Monday morning, he knew that the good week would not be extended into the following days.  “Hey, Penis.” Slowly, Peter turned around - but not before MJ could come to his rescue.  “You know, you throw that word around an awful lot for a straight dude.” “What…?” Flash turned bright red and ground his teeth. MJ eerily maintained eye contact with Flash until he decided Peter wasn’t worth it and walked away, muttering gross things that Peter wished he couldn’t hear. “Uh, hey, thanks.” Peter said, looking down at his shoes. He wasn’t embarrassed that MJ constantly defended him, he was just mad at himself - mad at his stupid super strength. It was what saved all those civilians when the bus’s brakes didn’t work, but it was also what made him unable to defend himself against his bully - for fear of literally murdering the kid. He started to feel guilty about his annoyance of his powers, so he quickly changed the topic as he saw MJ sketching in her journal. “I - I’m not in crisis!” He said, his voice a bit higher than it should have been. “I’ve expanded,” MJ said simply, flipping the journal open to its cover page where it read ASSHAT JOURNAL in all caps. She then flipped through the first few pages - all different sketches of Flash from different days. He really was an asshat, wasn’t he? The bell rang, signifying the start of the first period.  Classes passed by slowly that day, until finally - finally - was Aca Dec.  This was the one saving grace of the school day. MJ was captain now, and she didn’t take any of Flash’s shit – unlike all the teachers at Midtown. But when Peter walked in, Mr. Harrington was smiling – he never smiled.  “Uh, hey, Mr. Harrington – what’s - what’s up?” Peter was slightly unnerved by the man’s cheery countenance, but he thought he disguised it pretty well. Mr. Harrington just shook his head, and motioned for Peter to take his seat. Unfortunately, Flash found that time as good as any to chime in. “Hey, Penis – how's Mr. Stark?” Peter didn’t think Flash actually wanted to hear about the movie nights he had with his mentor, so he kept his mouth shut. A line of worry bounced across Mr. Harrington’s face, which was unusual as he usually ignored Flash’s idiotic comments. “Well, now that everybody’s here, may I begin?” Mr. Harrington could hardly stop smiling and Peter’s spidey-senses were going fucking insane. “So, you guys did amazingly at the Academic Decathalon. I’m so proud of you all. And, well, a few other people are pretty proud as well. After months of asking, our field trip has finally been approved by not only the school – but the heads of the destination. Please get these permission slips signed by tomorrow!” "Where are we going?” Abe asked. Mr. Harrington smiled again, showing all of his teeth. That was the first warning. “It’s a surprise. However, I will tell you that it will be a three-day trip starting tomorrow, so be sure to pack accordingly. Attached to your permission slips is a list of items you will not have to bring that will be provided by the destination. I know, I know, exciting. Since you did so well, you can take a free period to chat amongst yourselves instead of studying.” Ned immediately started rattling off a list of possible destinations into Peter and MJ’s ears while Peter daydreamed about a new idea for his web shooters that he was going to tinker with in his lab after school, while MJ seemed to be putting finishing touches on her most recent entry in the asshat journal. Eventually, the bell rang, and Peter ran out of school and jumped into Happy’s nondescript car.  “How was school today, kid?” “Woah, you actually want to hear?” After no response, Peter began excitedly babbling. No one could resist Peter’s excited babbling.  Eventually, they arrived at the tower.  Peter popped into the kitchen to grab an apple.  Clint signed something
