Chapter Text
"I'll be right back."Famous last words.Jane doesn’t answer, or if she does, it’s a muffled grunt of some kind. Darcy rolls her eyes as she walks out the door, plugging her earbuds in as she goes and ratcheting the volume up on her iPod to as loud as it’ll get. They need groceries. Thor’s recent visit has left the cupboards and the fridge basically empty. She loves the big guy, but he should probably chip in on the grocery bill at some point. She decides to mention it the next time he’s planet side. For now, she’s got money in one pocket and a list of necessities in the other. Jane has underlined Poptarts three times, as if Darcy could possibly forget her boss’s affinity for them.Truth be told, she’s not expecting be abducted. Who really expects something like that? But she figures, if she is, it’s going to boil down to one of two things. One, she is a friend/ally of Thor’s and they want to use her in some kind of weird hostage situation to get the Thunder God to… Well, she has no idea. She actually thinks that’s a dumb idea. Who wants to piss of a jacked alien and then dangle a friend in front of him to get him to retaliate? What kind of secrets do they think they’ll get from her or Thor? How he manages to keep his hair that pretty? She’d like to know too. But she doesn’t think he’ll spill the beans.The point is, he’s not someone they should want to fight, which leaves her with option number two. Jane. Brilliant, science loving, astrophysicist that she is, she’s recently let the whole world know that hey, she isn’t a crack pot, aliens exist, and she kicked their asses. So, it would make some sense if they stole Darcy, her plucky sidekick/intern, to get the deets on what Jane’s working on and how they can recreate it. Sadly, she thinks, they aren’t going to get much.In any case, those are the only two reasons she can think of for why anyone would want to abduct her. Well, as long as she’s not also considering sex slavery, which… Wow, disturbing. And sad.Darcy’s walking, mostly because her car was destroyed in the whole Dark Elves situation. And she’s not really paying attention. Something she will definitely regret later. She’s listening to Katy Perry, 'Dark Horse' blaring in her ears, when a hand suddenly grabs her arm and spins her. She stumbles, because her groove has been completely thrown off. And then she’s looking up into some goon’s face. He’s literally wearing head to toe black, and she briefly considers making a crack about fashion choice, but she’s frozen. Like a deer in the headlights, she just stares. And then he’s yanking her and a van is pulled up to the sidewalk. The jolt of her body being forced so abruptly knocks her bag from her shoulder; it tumbles to the pavement, pulling the headphones from her ears in the process. The sudden noise of the city is like cold water; dousing her with a sharp kick of reality. Her legs start moving and she’s pulling at her arm to get free, but then another goon is pushing her in from the other side, and suddenly she’s inside the van, on her hands and knees, confused and scared and really, really angry.Darcy isn’t the most physical person, and aside from hitting Thor with her taser, she’s also not much of a fighter. She wouldn’t say she was a pacifist, since she enjoys watching Ronda Rousey kick the shit out of people for funsies and she’s definitely cheered on Thor’s asskicking a few times. But she’s never been one for personally putting herself in the line of danger. Run away from things that hurt, that makes sense. Of course, she’s also stuck around Jane the last few years, which has led to not one but two alien attacks, so maybe she wasn’t as prone to running as she thought. She wants to run now. She wants to get as far away from these assholes as she can get. But she’s trapped. The back of the van is dark and hollow. She screams, as long and as loud as she can, but she doubts anybody can hear her over the sound of traffic. Still, she kicks and bangs on the walls of the van until a little slot opens from the front.“Shut up or we’ll make you shut up.”Darcy wants to be brave; she wants to pretend that threat doesn’t scare her. She wants to mouth off, say “make me,” like she’s daring them to even try. But the words clog up in her throat. Maybe it’s the look in his eye, that unholy gleam like he almost hopes she won’t be quiet, but it stops her. A little voice in her head (is that you Son of Coul?) tells her to stay calm. To think this through. To wait for some kind of opportunity to present itself so she can get out and get free.That opportunity never comes.When the van finally stops moving, she’s dragged out of the back and into a facility. The space between the van and the door is small, but the sun is bright and blinds her momentarily; the sudden change from complete darkness to daylight hurts. The door slams behind her, and suddenly its a polished floor squeaking under her sneakers instead of gravel. She trips a littl
