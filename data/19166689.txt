Chapter 1: Prologue
    


Notes:
So this is my first foray into 'Team Iron Man' related stories. I can get a tad obsessed with Team Iron Man fics, I decided to write this one while reading Anafandom's The Days of Reckoning Are Upon Us and Elenduen's works, and there are more inspirations, but there are too many to list here.As said in the summary, some pairings are yet to be decided, I for instance might ship Matt with Jessica (I love that ship) but I may just have them remain friends, we'll see how things plan out.

Chapter Text
The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen area as the three adults all congregated there, having just finished some early morning training exercises.Jessica Jones was the first to claim the coffee pot and gave herself a generous portion before passing it to Luke.Danny meanwhile poured himself some tea before sitting down with a bowl of cereal.Luke went to the fridge and grabbed some eggs when a fourth person appeared.Shuffling into the kitchen still clad in her pyjamas and accompanying bed head was Penelope Parker.“Morning Penny” Luke said as Penny made a small grunt of acknowledgment, still obviously not fully awake.“You want an omelette?”The still half asleep teen shook her head as she moved over to the cupboard, her still movements made her look like a zombie as she retrieved a box of cereal to pour into her own bowl.She was stopped however from grabbing any coffee by Jessica who moved the pot away from the brunette, which got a smile whine in response.“Don’t give me that, just eat your cereal and grab some tea if you want, we’ve all seen what your like when your caffeinated and it’s way too early in the morning for that” the older woman said as Penny grumbled but did in the end grab a cup and pour herself some tea, adding some honey before sitting up next to Jessica.It was a Saturday and Penny had stayed over the night before to work on some projects with Tony, as well as some minor upgrades on her web shooters.May was out of town for the week, so Penny was staying with Tony for the duration of her absence, which wasn’t anything new as the teen would stay over most weekends, or even on the rare school night.Danny excused himself as he went off to shower which would be followed up by his tai-chi practice, leaving the others to sit in pleasant silence.This went on for a few minutes before Tony sauntered into the kitchen and from the looks of it he hadn’t gotten much sleep, if any at all the previous night, this was only due to his clothes disheveled state and the grease stains.His tendency for pulling all night lab sessions had given the billionaire a well-developed tolerance for lack of sleep.“Morning kid” he said giving Penny a quick pat on the back as he passed. “And assorted others, how are we all on this fine morning”“Peachy” Jessica snarked back, though everyone knew there was no heat behind the remark.“Is Matthias joining us today or what?” Tony asked.It was Luke who answered, looking up as he was transferring his omelette onto a plate.“Matt’s got a case he’s preparing for on Tuesday, he said he’d try and stop in, but he’s going to be pretty busy”Tony gave a nod. “Especially when coupled with his night time activities” he said as he went to start a fresh pot of coffee.As he waited for the coffee to brew he sat down between Jessica and Penny, flipping through a tablet over the designs he’d been working on in his lab previously, before Penny’s voice piped up.“Hey Mr Stark, I was just wondering if it was OK if Ned and MJ came over Monday after school, we were going to work on some Academic Decathlon drills”“And binge watch Star Wars for the hundredth time” Jessica chimed in with a knowing smirk.“That’s fine kid, I can come pick you up after school, or if I’m busy I can send Happy”“Thanks Mr Stark” Penny said gratefully before turning to Jessica. “And there’s always room for more in the Star Wars marathon if you’re interested”Jessica gave a light snort into her coffee cup.“Looks like the galaxy will have to somehow make due with Obi-Wan and without the heroics of Jessica Jones” Luke said teasingly as Jessica merely rolled his eyes.“Why don’t you give bird boy a call, he and the Justice League kiddy club are coming by tomorrow”“The Titans are coming!? Sweet, they haven’t been by in like a month” Penny said excitedly.“Just what this place needs, more young people” Tony said with a mock weariness as Penny merely laughed and went to get more cereal, her radioactive spider metabolism at work as she poured herself a second bowl.“So Luke how’s the fundraising going for the new youth centre” Tony asked as Luke was seated opposite him working through the omelette.“It’s going well, we’ve managed to get more than enough donors on board, including a rather generous one who wanted to remain anonymous” Luke said looking at Tony knowingly.Luke had been approached by the director of one of the old Youth Cen
