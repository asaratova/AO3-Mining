Chapter Text
Katsuki doesn’t cry when he’s born. The nurses jostle Mitsuki, excitedly telling her what a resilient boy he is, how strong he’s going to be when he’s older. Mitsuki watches those red eyes, so similar to her own, yet so different. Katsuki watches back. She holds his gaze for a few long moments, and he stares back intently, with intelligence that a newborn baby shouldn’t have. Nurses bustle in the background, gently patting her on the back, putting away dirty sheets and tools. He’s absolutely gorgeous, eyes a piercing crimson and blonde hair matted against his tiny crown. He watches her, long after he’s taken from her arms and placed in a basin to be cleaned off, and then into a cot. Mitsuki lets herself sink into her hospital bed, and smiles. Her beautiful boy has been born, and he’s perfect. He didn’t cry once, even the nurses are delighted, and she’s so  proud. She’s still smiling when she finally slips into an exhausted slumber, and his gaze lingers on her turned back long after the lights are dimmed.  He doesn’t cry the next day, or the day after that. Mitsuki is unsettled at first, but she decides it’s a blessing—Katsuki is her first, and she’s heard enough horror stories to know that a baby’s crying will grow to be a nightmare. So she lets herself be relieved, grateful that her son is so low-maintenance, so sweet, and decides to enjoy the silence while it lasts. And it does last. It lasts and lasts, and lasts some more. They’re taking Katsuki home in the car, finally discharged from the hospital, and he hasn’t cried once. He watches her, eyes steady and unwavering and  dissecting  in a way that makes her look away instinctively, before she mentally slaps herself for it. That’s her  baby boy. She looks back, and smiles at him gently. He stares back. The ride is long.   When three weeks have passed and Katsuki still doesn’t cry, the relief turns to concern. No parenting manual prepared her for this—this placid, imperturbable infant. He doesn’t even cry when he’s hungry, or when he’s uncomfortable. She tosses and turns, wondering if he’s sick, or there’s something wrong. But Masaru assures her that he’s just clever for his age. Of  course  he’s clever, Mitsuki knew he would be. He’s  hers. But when she takes him to a play group and sees all the other babies sobbing, hands clenching in their mothers’ shirts like the babies in the Pinterest photos that she’d fawned over in the early stages of her pregnancy, she feels amiss. He nestles primly in her arms, watching the other wailing infants unblinkingly as he fiddles with a button on Mitsuki’s shirt. Frazzled mothers look at him in jealousy, at her baby boy sitting pretty and still in her grasp, and ask her how she does it. She doesn’t answer, doesn’t know  how, and just smiles. And somewhere inside her, she feels that same pride she’d felt when the nurses had patted her on the back. Her Katsuki might be a little off, a little too smart, but he’s  hers. And she’s damn lucky to have him.   At two and half months, Katsuki has started to babble. He gurgles happily, stubby fingers reaching for any and everything in his grip. He doesn’t cry. He’s crawling by six months, and by seven he’s forming words. The sounds are unfamiliar on his tiny tongue, falling out roughly like mismatched puzzle pieces. Mitsuki is yet to see a single tear fall. Inko brings her boy around now, and they start to hold playdates. Katsuki is only three months older than Izuku, but the green-haired infant is nothing like her son. He cries constantly, little face screwing up at the slightest inconvenience, at  nothing. He’s absolutely lovely, pudgy little fingers clinging to Katsuki’s shirt as he wails. Katsuki doesn’t push him off, but there’s an adorably petulant curl to his lips at the younger boy’s loud cries. Mitsuki and Inko take  so many photos.  Katsuki is eight months old when she finds the knife in his cot. She thinks she’s hallucinating, first, when she goes to check on her son and finds him curled around her kitchen blade, sleeping soundly. His soft, tender skin is close, too close to the blade, and she feels her heart stop. Already ready to give Masaru the verbal beatdown of his life when he gets home from work, she reaches into his bed to shakily extract the blade, only to halt in her tracks when Katsuki’s eyes snap open and latch onto hers. His small fingers reach to cling to the knife, tightly in the way that babies do, and she flinches violently as the edge cuts through soft skin, and blood begins to well up at his fingers. But he doesn’t cry, doesn’t let go. His eyes stayed fixed on hers. Swallowing thickly, she reaches down again to take the knife, but pulls back instantly when his grip tightens around it, earning another droplet of blood. “Give mommy the knife, darling,” she whispers, hands trembling in fear. He watches her, grip unfaltering on the blade. “Katsuki, give it to me. Please?”He babbles something back in his weird baby speak,
