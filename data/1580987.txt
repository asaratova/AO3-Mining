Do You Wanna Build A Snowman
Frozen Soundtrack
Bucky x Darcy
xXx
 
Bucky wished more than anything that he had tried harder to protest watching Frozen with Darcy (who was he Kidding he could never say no to her).The minute the second song began to play she turned to him with a huge smile and crazy eyes that would have given Zola the creeps. Apparently, there was a connection in her mind between the Winter Soldier and the snow queen. He tried not to think too much into the comparison.
For the next month he was subjected to what could only be described as torture. Somehow she managed to get ahold of his phone and changed every ring tone to that cursed song. It only took one text (from her of course) for him to be completely mortified in front of Tony and once Tony knows something, everyone knows. 
And so for the next month anytime he walked into a room with the rest of the team present Jarvis blasted said song. His eyes always picked out Darcy in the group and every time she looked so proud of herself, as if she had made his life so much better with this one song.
The month passed and Bucky was almost tempted to let the Winter Soldier out to scare them all enough to leave him alone again when a thought occurred to him. Two months ago everyone but Darcy and Steve had tip toed around him like he was a bomb about to go off. They were afraid, they were anxious and they didn't trust him. One month later they watched the movie and for the rest of that month no one steered clear of him. They were all too busy teasing him.
Darcy smiled sweetly as he approached her the lab later that day. "Hey Elsa." She greets him warmly. 
"Sneaky, doll." Her smile widened into an evil grin. "You planned this whole thing, just so everyone would feel better around me?"
She shrugged. "What can I say, you're just a bit of a fixer upper." 
She then proceeded to burst into song.
