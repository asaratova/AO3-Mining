Fandom: Marvel (MCU)Prompt: Hey so idk if you take requests and you most definitely do not have to write this, but I was wondering if you would write a peter goes on a field trip to stark tower drabble? 
Peter was going to die. Right here. On this desk.  
Mmm, whatcha sayy…
 “Make sure you bring your permission slips back tomorrow,” their chemistry teacher was still saying, “and the trip is on Wednesday.” “You hear that, Penis?” Flash turns around in his chair. “You’ve got two more days before we expose you for being a liar!” “Shut up, Flash,” Ned mutters, poking Peter’s shoulder. “Dude, you’re gonna get to show me your lab!” “No, I’m not. I’m going to die.” Peter buries his head further into his arms, pressing his forehead against the cool wood. “Right here. Then I don’t have to do anything.” “Come on, dude! It’ll be so much fun!” Ned bounces in his seat, still poking Peter’s shoulder. “You can show me all your stuff! We can go walk around and talk about all the cool stuff!” He glances around before leaning closer to Peter. “You can show me the Spider-Man stuff!” “Shh!” Peter pulls Ned closer. “Don’t…talk about that.” “Too late,” MJ supplies helpfully from her desk, holding up the newest addition to the ‘People In Distress’ sketchbook. “Luckily for you guys the rest of the class are oblivious.” “They won’t be on Wednesday!” Ned shoves the permission slip in his backpack. “We can finally get them to shut up about this. You can prove you’re not lying!” “If I make it ‘till Wednesday,” Peter mutters.  Aunt May’s no help. She signs the permission slip without even looking at it.  “Come on, Pete, it’s kind of funny,” she teases, “you’re taking a field trip to your office!” “May,” Peter whines, “can’t you just…let me off?” “You’ve missed a lot of school already, Peter.” May sits down across from him. “At least this’ll let you show them where it’s been going.” “I guess…” “Do your teachers still think you’re lying?” May rests her hand on his shoulder. “Wouldn’t it be nice to get them off your back?” “That’s not what I’m really worried about…” “What is it, sweetie?” Peter leans his head onto her shoulder, letting her stroke her hands through his hair. “I just…I don’t want to be embarrassed.” “You’re a teenager, Pete, I don’t think that’s an option.” “But everyone’s gonna think I’m showing off!” Peter jerks his head away, running his own hands through his hair. “I’m not, I just…the internship is fun. I don’t want them to make it not fun.” “You’re a smart kid, Peter. Mr. Stark knows that. Isn’t it time the rest of your class figure that out too?” May stands up, wrapping her arms around him in a comforting hug. “The internship is yours. They can’t take it away from you. And I doubt Mr. Stark’s gonna let them see everything you do. It’ll be okay.” Peter hugs May tightly. “Thanks, May.” “Of course.” The second Peter steps foot on the bus Wednesday morning he knows it’s gonna be a long day.  “Hey, Penis! Ready to get humiliated?” Flash hangs over the bus seat, smirking as Peter climbs up the steps. “Maybe Tony Stark will come and tell you he doesn’t know you personally.” “Maybe he’ll come down to figure out why there’s so much noise coming from such a small person.” The bus laughs at MJ’s comment, letting Peter slink to the back of the bus and collapse into the seat next to Ned. “It’ll be okay,” Ned murmurs, giving Peter’s hand a squeeze, “you still have the rest of the tour to stand on the opposite side of the room.” “Yeah, I know.” Peter glances across the aisle to see MJ already sketching. “It’s gonna be fine.” Stark Tower looms large in the New York City skyline. The bus parks and the kids swarm out, staring up at the building in awe. Peter shuffles out, keeping his head down and trying to stay as far away from Flash as possible. A hand catches his elbow.  “Peter,” Mr. Montague says quietly, out of earshot of the rest of the class, “I know you’ve got this fantasy that you have a Stark internship, but try and enjoy the tour, okay?’ Peter nods automatically, ignoring the glare Ned and MJ shoot Mr. Montague.  “Dude, why are you letting them do that?” “It’s not like I can do anything about it,” Peter hisses back as they climb the steps, “I’m just gonna keep my head down as much as I can.” Ned nods, looking a little disappointed. “But you’ll still whisper all the cool stuff to me, right?” Peter smiles. “Right.” “Midtown?” The tour guide stands at the top of the steps, her arms covered in lanyards. “Welcome to Stark Tower. My name is Katie, I’ll be your tour guide for today.” Katie. Okay, Peter feels safer already. Katie’s one of the interns that he works with for Dr. Banner’s stuff. She’ll be low-key. It’ll be fine.  “Now, in order to get into the Tower, you need to have a security badge.” Katie spreads her arms. “So come get ‘em.” Peter thanks his foresight for being at the back of the group as his classmates all but stampede at poor Katie to try and get the badges.  “What level are these?” Flash wraps the lanya
