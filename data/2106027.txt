“We've all got meanness in us...But we have some good in us too.

And the only thing worth living for is the good.” –Billie Letts
  -   ✮   - Darcy looked up at the sudden burst of noise, audible even over the music blasting through her headphones, and put down the soldering gun she was holding. Pausing in her work, she pulled one earbud out and heard a shout.“We need a doctor! JARVIS, where’s the doctor?”She was on her feet in an instant, hauling ass out in to the hall. There were three men, two holding up the one in the middle, making their way as fast as they could towards her and the medical lab at the end of the hall. For a second, Darcy stared stupidly at them, her eyes fastened on the man in the middle. His head hung between his shoulders, blood evident even on the black leather of his armour, but it was the silver metal of his one arm, slung across the shoulders of one of the others, that really caught her attention.“Medical is being prepped for your arrival, Captain,” came the smooth reply of JARVIS’ voice. It snapped her out of her daze.Turning on her heel, Darcy ran the short distance down the hall and shoved the medical lab door open, holding it for them. They shuffled through awkwardly, the dark haired man hanging limply between the two of them, as a handful of doctors in scrubs rushed up to them with a stretcher. The two hauled the injured man on to it and Darcy was surprised to see that he was not unconscious, just incapable of holding himself up. His head lolled to the side, facing her, but it was clear that whatever he was seeing, it wasn’t the here and now.The doctors rushed him away, leaving the two men standing there, their hands suddenly empty. Both of them were filthy, and looked like they could use a little medical attention themselves, but no other doctors seemed to be forthcoming. The blond suddenly seemed to deflate, and he staggered, holding one hand out to brace himself against the wall.“You okay, man?” the other asked. Personally, Darcy thought that someone should be asking him that question. While the blond looked dirty and immeasurably tired, his friend was definitely worse for wear. He was bleeding from several small wounds on his chest, back, and arms, and even under his dark complexion she could see bruises forming almost everywhere skin showed.“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. I just…” Instead of answering, he put his back to the wall and slid down until his ass hit the floor.The other man walked up to him and copied the motion, sliding down until they were sitting side by side. He clapped his friend on the arm. “He’s gonna be all right. Stark employs the best.”The blond nodded, but didn’t say anything. Darcy knew that the reassurance was probably less than helpful, even if it was true. Unnoticed, she turned and slipped out, heading back for Jane’s lab.Her work, the motherboard for Jane’s new spectrometer, lay abandoned on the table as she headed for her snack drawer. Darcy kept a variety of things in the lab—not just Pop Tarts—because it was incredibly difficult to get Jane to leave for a meal when she was on to something and there simply wasn’t enough nutritional content in Pop Tarts to sustain anyone for long. She grabbed a box of the strawberry flavoured ones, along with several granola bars, and stuffed them into the pouch of her hoodie. Underneath one of the spare desks was a case of bottled water, and she snagged a couple of those as well before making her way back to medical.They were sat exactly where she left them, only this time they looked up at her as she entered.“Um, are you hungry?” she asked, holding up the box of Pop Tarts and the two bottles of water.“Pop Tarts?” the battered man grinned at her. He and his friend were in a neck n’ neck race for who was the filthiest. Or the hottest. At least they were on equal footing, Darcy thought. “I haven’t had those in years.”“They’re pretty much the only thing I can shove into my bosses mouth when she’s on a science bender.” Darcy reached into her pouch and pulled out the granola. “But there’s also these if you crave a little, you know, actual sustenance.”The dark skinned man smiled again, albeit tiredly, but blondie simply stared at her as if he didn’t understand what was happening. His face was streaked with dirt and blood, his clothes ripped and stained with more blood and god knew what else. Clearly, they had just come from a fight.It was an aspect of living in the Avengers Tower that Darcy had yet to experience.“I’m Sam Wilson,” handsome and chatty said, holding out his hand. “I’d get up to greet you properly, but I’m honestly not sure if I can.”She gave him a smile, but instead of reaching forward to shake his hand, she stuffed the box of Pop Tarts into his grip. “I’m Darcy Lewis.”“This is Steve,” Sam added, nodding his head towards the other man.At the sound of his name, handsome but silent blinked and seemed to come to himself. “My apologies,” he said, his voice raspy. “Steve Rogers.” He hel
