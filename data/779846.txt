Chapter 1





Chapter Text
"We've been crime fighting bffs for forever, and you're pretty much the only Avenger whose identity is still hidden from me."Spider-Man glanced over at Johnny Storm, who was leaning against an alleyway wall with his arms crossed and waiting for an answer. "You wouldn't want to know my actual identity anyway. He's a bit of a loser," Peter said, shrugging.It was true. Peter had a lingering suspicion that Johnny Storm, media sweetheart, hot-as-all-hell-both-literally-and-figuratively superhero, wouldn't be caught dead hanging out with the likes of Peter Parker when he was out of his suit."Right," Johnny replied, rolling his eyes. "Because I completely judge people by how they look, and then I never talk to them again even though they're my crime fighting bff.""I didn't mean that... it's just...""Who do you take me for anyway? I mean, what's this big secret? Oh. My. God. Are you a girl?"Suddenly Johnny Storm was very very close to Peter. Peter squirmed under his staring."Dude. Of course that would be the question you went to. No, I'm not a girl."Johnny shrugged."Doesn't matter. You know I'll still have the hots for you, Webhead," Johnny replied with a wink.Sometimes Peter wished that Johnny could see how often Peter rolled his eyes during their conversations. "You have the hots for pretty much anybody, Johnny," Peter sighed."You're different, darling," Johnny cooed. "Right," Peter replied, "So are we going back or what? Because, I'm not exactly made of heat over here...""Ooh, Spidey. You want me to warm you up?""You're hopeless."
