~Bruce Banner~

Tony doesn’t hear about the accident the way everybody else does; through the news, three weeks later, a single line in the news ticker on the evening broadcast. No, he hears about it the morning it happens.Because he’s there.He’s here at all of these.To make sure they don’t work.He doesn’t know much about the guy who put in this proposal. Just another would-be victor to his father’s failures back in World War II. Technically, that super soldier project is supposed to be classified, but the story’s gotten around. It’s become something of a grail discovery in the scientific community, like anti-gravity or cold fusion, in the five years or so since dad’s been gone. A serum that super-charges the human body. Fascinating stuff, sure.But dad failed at it. And frankly, Tony hates the idea of anybody succeeding where dad failed. It may be petty to give a shit about it, but dad’s only been dead a few years and maybe the grief still hasn’t settled, or maybe it’s just kind of fun to fuck with people, or maybe Tony wants to save this discovery for himself later on.At any rate, it means he’s at the lab the day that Bruce Banner damn near kills himself. And if he wasn’t there, watching from the outside observation room along with all the military observers, if he didn’t recognize the signs of a reactor breach, didn’t know the override codes for the doors, didn’t act right before it was too late, didn’t get him out of there before the whole thing exploded, Bruce Banner would be dead right now.Instead of yelling at him in some back room.“Goddammit, man! You know how fucking long it took for me to put that together! You know how much I had riding on this?” the other man demands, storming around, grabbing at his hair. “Fuck! This was my one chance to...”“Get yourself killed?” Tony yawns. He’s leaning up against the hard, cold, brick wall of the room. Just watching. “Fucking ungrateful, if you ask me. You really need to...”But he gets no further, because Bruce tries to hit him, he dodges, and the scientist’s hand connects with the wall instead of Tony’s face.He takes him to the emergency room. Waits with him until the doctor’s able to set his hand. Banner is strangely quiet through the whole thing, so much different from the raging, mindless thing he was after the accident.When Tony asks him if he’s got somewhere to go, someone to call, he just shakes his head, and won’t meet his eyes. “You can just drop me off at my hotel, I guess,” he mumbles, and scrunches into his loose purple oxford that’s just as tired-looking as he is.“My ass,” Tony tells him.He takes him home with him instead. It’s a four hour drive to his place in LA. Banner doesn’t say a word that entire time.He doesn’t protest, at least, when Tony bundles him out of the car, up into his very small, very expensive beachfront house, past all the various, half-finished projects that litter every horizontal surface, up to the only bedroom.“Stark, look, I don’t usually, you know,” and Banner gestures with his good hand around the room as Tony pushes him down on the bed, works on unbuttoning his shirt.“Call me Tony, okay?” he says, grinning. “And don’t worry. I do this all the time.”“What, help out stupid would-be doctorates who almost get themselves killed trying to get that one last scholarship?” And he sighs. “If you hadn’t gotten me out of there, the gamma radiation might have...”“Shh,” Tony soothes, and goes to work on the other man’s pants. “You should be more worried about those anger issues of yours.”“Yeah, I guess I can kind of... do that... sometimes.”“I kinda like the big rage monster.”They end up kissing that night, snugged together in bed. It’s more than Banner’s probably comfortable with, Tony knows, and for once, he doesn’t push it. He wants to help, he finds, more than he wants to take. Which is actually kind of cool.So in the morning, when his guest is out sitting on the beach, watching the waves crash along the shore, he calls around. Finds Banner’s student loan company, his university, his records, his last master’s capstone. Poor guy’s got nearly $50K sunk into schooling at this point, but if the faxed copy of his thesis is right, he’s a fucking genius. Physics and medicine. The Army was going to send him to get his PhD, but now that his proposal's gone bottom-up...Tony pays it all off. All of it. Including the Cal Poly doctorate that hasn’t started yet. And goes out to sit on the sand with Banner.He half-expects Banner to turn into the rage monster from yesterday when he tells him about.  Better to beg for forgiveness, he figures. Instead, he just looks like he’s going to cry. Says that’s not necessary, that he can’t possibly accept that kind of charity. Tony puts an arm around his shoulder and pulls them together and tells him he’s always welcome, no matter what.Bruce stays with him for another two weeks. Until the semester starts. And despite promises that he’ll visit often, Tony doesn’t see him again until Thanksgivin
