Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It happened on their designated movie night. One minute they're all sitting there watching Tommy Boy, the next Loki is standing in the center of the ring of overstuffed couches with a glowing, green orb hovering over his outstretched right hand and a wicked smile painted on his face.Thor was the first one out of his seat. He shouted questions at his brother of how he could be out of the grasp of their father and back on Midgard. But Loki's left hand shot out and with some whisper of words most of them didn't catch, Thor was locked in place."I have come bearing a gift," Loki spoke, his silver tongue saying words in that infuriatingly calm tone. "Your greatest desires and your worst nightmares." He paused to hold the orb closer to his face, inspecting the magic within. "It is interesting how much the two overlap, is it not?"Without notice, Loki slammed the glowing sphere down at the feet of the Avengers. Natasha and Steve, possessors of the quickest reflexes, were closest to the orb when it hit the ground. They tried their best to contain as much of the light and mist expelled, but this wasn't an average grenade that you could throw yourself on to minimize damage. This was magic from a monster, and save for Thor, they still weren't used to dealing with that.A number of things happened at once: Thor, free from whatever magic held him in place, tackled Loki to the ground and bellowed at Heimdall to open the recently repaired Bifrost; the brothers vanished in a column of light. Bruce morphed into his other self. Tony began rambling equation after number after scientific theory. And Clint let out a guttural yell as something or someone hit the ground.It was the last one that drew Natasha's greatest worry. She turned to see Clint kneeling beside Coulson's body. And that's all that was left of the handler—a body. It was already cold and pale in its death with dried blood staining his chest all over again. Natasha felt more than heard the imposing footsteps of The Other Guy from behind her and half-listened to Steve's shouts as he tried to calm the beast, but none of them were prepared to hear what the Hulk was actually saying."Get out of the way, move aside," the deep voice ordered. "Let me see if I can help." Natasha obeyed the commands out of instinct. She watched as the green giant knelt beside Coulson's still form. He reached out to needlessly check his pulse when he caught sight of his own hands. The Hulk raised them up slowly and turned them over in front of his face. "This can't be," he said softly.Natasha agreed. They'd all heard the Hulk on the comm lines. The majority of his dialogue involved grunts and barbaric yells. Despite the appearance and sound of the voice, Natasha knew whose mind was in control, and it wasn't The Other Guy's. "Bruce?" she asked softly.He nodded his large head. "My mind, his body.""Someone help him!" Clint shouted at them, pulling their focus back to matter at hand.Natasha didn't know what to do or say. She knew SHIELD could work some medical miracles, already had on Coulson eight months ago when Loki stabbed him on the Helicarrier, but it looked like life had left the handler's body hours ago, not minutes. Despite that, she heard Rogers ordering for a med unit to get to their position immediately.Natasha reached over the corpse to take Clint's hand but he swatted it away. "No," he ground out. "I just got him back. This isn't going to happen again."As if willed by the words, Coulson gulped in air as color and life returned to him instantaneously. His eyes aimlessly searched the room until they found focus on Clint's face. "What happened?" he asked, trying to catch his breath.Clint didn't answer with words. Coulson had lost his tie and jacket before coming to relax with the team, so it was only a dress shirt that Clint had to rip open in order to inspect Phil's chest. Natasha craned her head to examine, too, and she couldn't believe what she saw—or rather what she didn't see. Phil's chest held no marks. There was no scar, and no sign of the source of blood that had dried on his shirt. Gingerly, Clint sat Coulson up and pulled the shirt down further to show that the other man's back was free of scarring, too."Sir, how are you feeling?" Steve asked.Coulson gave his head a small shake and shrugged his shoulders. "I feel fine, a little disoriented, but nothing hurts." He paused as he rolled his shoulders around and rotated his left arm in the air. "Actually, I feel better than I have since before I was attacked." He continued to roll his neck and test muscles. Clint's eyes and hand never leaving Phil's face or back.Natasha's rolled backwards from her haunches to sit on the ground, trying to process everything that just happened. Before she could even being to think, a med team rushed into the common room with a couple of gurneys and demands of a sitrep.Bruce began giving an oral report full of medical details to the team who, to SHIELD's credit, didn't look s
