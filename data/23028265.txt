Chapter 1: Sleepy
    




Chapter Text
"Tony, you have to go to this meeting, they've been breathing down my neck for the last month to get these budgets sorted out," Pepper sighed, obviously exhausted and clutching her clipboard close to her chest as she stared intently at her boss.The billionaire wasn't playing much attention to her, resting his chin on his five year-old son's head, the watermelon scent of the child's shampoo tickling his nose. Peter was happily watching a Disney movie on the TV, sat in his father's lap and slouched against the man's broad chest, the billionaire's arms wrapped around him in a safe, warm cocoon.Tony sighed through his nose, ruffling his son's soft chestnut curls. "Come on, Pep, it's eight on a Saturday night," he groaned, mimicking the way a child would whine when they couldn't get their own way.Peter giggled, turning his attention away from the film for a second and Tony grinned, dropping a kiss to the crown of his son's head. He turned his pleading gaze on his personal assistant again."Pull me a favor and get it booked for tomorrow, I'm kinda busy right now," he murmured, gradually becoming occupied with nuzzling and kissing his child's hair.Pepper couldn't stop the smirk from appearing on her face. Ever since Peter was born, Tony had become completely smitten with the little boy. He was the accidental result of a quick fling, but a happy accident. She sighed good-naturedly and rolled her eyes in amusement."I'll see what I can do," she said, turning to leave and give the two some space, before stopping in the shadow of the doorway to watch them.Tony released a huge sigh, his cheeks blowing into balloons as he reached for the remote and switched the TV off just as the credits began to roll, the living room plunging into a hazy, golden glow from the lamp beside the sofa.Peter turned from his position on his father's lap, his bony knees digging into the man's thighs as the little boy settled himself so he was face to face with the billionaire.Tony regarded him softly and puffed his cheeks up again, pulling a silly face and Peter grinned, mischievously. He reached his hands up and patted his father's face innocently, before smacking them against the man's cheeks, who released the breath he was holding in with a sharp exhale right in the child's face. The force blew the boy's curls away from his fore-head and Peter shrieked with laughter, the sweet sound escalating when his father began tickling his son, calloused fingers wriggling under the boy's shirt, causing him to squirm uncontrollably in the man's hold.It was only when Peter turned red from laughter and began to wheeze did Tony finally stop, gazing at his son with warm, dark eyes, all gooey like melted chocolate, as he gently lifted the little boy higher into his arms as he stood from the sofa.Peter settled into the familiar hold, his small arms wrapping around the man's neck and his head resting on his shoulder, right where it met the neck. This was where Peter felt safe and protected. Tony gently rocked his child, turning his head to place a sweet kiss on his son's soft cheek, causing Peter to nuzzle closer, his cold nose pressing into his father's neck.The billionaire carded his fingers through the boy's hair, untangling small knots as he made his way to his son's bedroom, smiling softly when he felt Peter lean into the touch. Tony carried him to his bed and pulled back the Star Wars themed duvet, gently lowering his son onto the mattress and tucking him in, just as the boy let out a huge yawn. He grinned, sheepishly, up at his father, a small fist coming up to rub at the sleep in his eye.Tony smiled, tenderly, his heart blooming with a love so powerful it almost took his breath away and he bent down to kiss the boy's cheek, then his nose. Peter giggled, softly, his legs kicking out under the blanket as he wriggled under the tickly sensation of his father's goatee. The billionaire chuckled, leaning back to smooth his hand over the duvet to calm his son's squirming, who watched his father with adoring eyes, which were beginning to glaze over with sleep."Now go to sleep, little bug. Daddy has a very important meeting tomorrow," Tony murmured, running his fingers through the soft locks for a self-indulgent moment and chuckled when Peter turned onto his stomach into his favorite sleeping position. He nearly purred at the feeling of his father's warm hand gently caressing his scalp. "Love you tons, baby," Tony whispered, tenderly kissing the child's fore-head and tucking the blanket tighter around his son's small body."Love you, Daddy," Peter murmured, his words slurring as he drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Tony smoothed his child's hair down and, feeling suddenly conscious of someone watching them and he turned his head to see Pepper standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame. She was smiling, softly."Got the meeting re-scheduled for Monday so you can spend the day with Peter tomorrow," she said.Tony returned
