Chapter 1: I don't get paid enough to deal with this
    




Chapter Text
There was about a million and one things Steve hated about his job, his boss and ignorant customers were high on that list. Getting up at the ass crack of dawn to get there was also high on that list. However there were days when work wasn’t absolutely shitty and today was one of them. Lucky for him all his favourite people were working today and Clint’s sass game was extra high. He supposed he would have noticed Tony Stark in the crowd if he hadn’t been too busy running his ass off and listening to Clint fuck with people but hey, the surprise made it all the better. “Sorry, what was that?” Clint asks the irritated customers in front of him for the third time. Steve knew damn well Clint knew what the two guys wanted, he was a master lip reader, but they were being jackasses so Clint was making them wait.“Jesus fuck, are you deaf or something?” one of them snaps. Steve can practically see the glee in Clint’s eyes and he knows exactly where this is going.Clint removes a hearing aid from his left ear and waves it around, “look buddy I have eighty percent hearing loss in both ears so mumbling in a crowded coffee shop makes it impossible to hear you,” he sticks the hearing aid back in, “so can you repeat your order louder please?” he says politely but forcefully. Steve has to think of dead kittens to keep himself from bursting out laughing at Clint’s antics.The two assholes sputter apologies and repeat their order louder this time and Steve sets off to make it. He snickers while his back it turned and drops the two drinks in front of the neon coated fuckboys, making sure to give them a judgmental look that he knows will make them feel shitty. He’s tested it on Natasha and it’s practically impossible to make her feel guilty. The two slink off in shame and Clint snorts out laughter, “that was fucking great, they felt so bad! They’re talking about how they were huge assholes now,” he claps his hands and laughs evilly.“Barton, go on break and stop messing with the customers,” Peggy gives Clint a stern look. He sighs dramatically and leaves the floor. “What did he do?” Peggy asks, interested now that Clint can’t see her laugh. It was some sort of weird game they had, Clint did his damnedest to make Peggy laugh and Peggy refused to break.  He was fairly certain money was involved at this point. Steve tells her and she snorts loudly and covers her mouth with her hand, “oh my god I wish I had seen that!” Steve grins and returns to the cash register to do his stupid job.That’s when he sees Tony, some guy he was sure was his best friend Rhodey, and a third unknown person with a metal arm. Neat. He doesn’t bother to ask them what they want, they should know the drill, but no, all three of them were looking behind him.“Uh, that toaster appears to be on fire,” Tony says and Steve inwardly shoots himself. He’s been waiting for years to hear the words that were tattooed on his forearm in beautiful, loopy handwriting that resembled calligraphy more than someone’s writing. It had been a nice daydream, at least until he realized he’d be at work when he heard them. Not to mention that he had two sentences, both involving the damn toaster so he knew for sure his soulmates had met beforehand. When he realized he’d be the third wheel he was significantly less excited by the prospect of a soulmate. The bond could have been platonic of course, but he had a feeling that it wasn’t. He wasn’t ready for his life to turn into a soap opera, certainly not one the media would make a spectacle out of. His life was a damn joke.He turns around to find Natasha taking a picture of the fire on her phone, no doubt Instagraming the whole thing looking amused. He raises an indifferent eyebrow at them, this sort of thing happened way too much for him to give a damn.“Seriously though,” Metal Arm says, “that fire is getting bigger,” he gestures behind Steve. Damn, and there was the second line written on his arm, the writing was block-y and all capitals, it was significantly less beautiful that Tony’s but more practical. He looks back to find Natasha no doubt praying that something bigger will catch so she could go home. Steve rolls his eyes, grabs a cup, fills it with water and throws it on the fire. Most of it goes out instantly so he leaves the rest to Nat, who now knows her dreams of going home are dashed.“I don’t get paid enough to care about this shit,” he says, sounding snippier than intended but too tired to care.Tony and the metal armed guy turn to each other with side smiles, “he doesn’t get paid enough to care about this shit!” they yell in sync. “Nice! We found the third, Pepper’s gunna be pissed that we managed to find two soulmates before she found one,” Tony says to Metal Arm.  Rhodey looks at him likes grown a second head, “Pepper will be mad? You people…  You two shit heads manage to manage to find two people and I can’t even find one. What the hell is this?” Rhodey
