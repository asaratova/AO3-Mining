Chapter 1: True Power
    




Chapter Text
"No..." Loki murmured, his eyes blown wide. He was pale and sweating and he didn't even register the confused and worried look Thor sent his way, "It can't be..." he said. It came out like a whisper, his voice never making it out of his mouth. He was shaking in fear, unable to tear his eyes away from the humongous space battleship that had just appeared in front of them.
It's him...
"Brother, wha-"Thor's worried question was cut off by a giant explosion as the battleship opened fire on them and struck the defenceless Statesman. The blow quaked the entire craft, punching a hole in the right side of the hull that sucked out at least a dozen people.Thor screamed in denial as he ran to the closest porthole, unable to do anything but watch his people being sucked in the vacuum of space. Loki barely registered his actions, absolutely transfixed as he looked out of another porthole and saw the poor victims wiggle for a few seconds before the life finally left them.Then, the gigantic spaceship opened fire again. This time the lights in the Sakaaran vessel flickered for a long moment. When they turned back on, absolute chaos had taken over the ship.The second blow had also knocked both Loki and Thor off their feet. Thor was the one who recovered the fastest: "Loki! Get up, we need to go!" he shouted, reaching his adoptive brother and trying to pull him up.But Loki didn't even hear him. He was petrified."No... How did he find me?" he whispered."Loki, what are you talking about!? Loki!" Thor shouted again. Then another blow came.This time, it hit really close to the room Thor and Loki were in. A crack opened in the outer hull of the ship, starting to suck out air. It was only thanks to his Asgardian physiology that Thor was able to grab the still unresponsive Loki and all but drag him out of the room.They reached the command bridge. Heimdall and Brunnhilde were there."What's going on!? Who are these people!? Why are they attacking us!?" the Valkyrie yelled. She was trying to appear as calm as she could, but apparently she was almost overwhelmed herself by the sudden attack. Especially so soon after Hela.It had been only three months since the Goddess of Death had resurfaced and sieged Asgard. They had managed to defeat her, but at a terrible cost.And now, this. Or, more accurately... Him.
No... Not now, no... Not after everything that's happened...
"We can't return fire, we don't have any weapon!" he heard Brunnhilde say."Can we run away?" Thor asked then."The engines are damaged," Valkyrie answered, almost shouting, "and even if they weren't, this ship is slower than a snail! We will never be able to outrun them!"It was true. The Statesman was a big ship, but it was painfully slow. Three months of deep-space navigation - three months since the destruction of Asgard - and they had made it barely more than halfway to Earth.We cannot fight... We cannot flee... We're doomed... Loki thought. He was still looking around frantically. People were running in all directions like headless chickens."Send out a distress call!" Thor ordered, "the ship won't hold much longer!"Heimdall nodded gravely and relayed the order to one of the Sakaaran gladiators. Thor and Valkyrie exchanged a look that Loki knew all too well.That determined, stubborn, stupid look Thor always had before a battle he couldn't possibly hope to win. He had it on Jotunheim, in front of all of Laufey's forces. He had it on Svartalfheim, against Malekith, Kurse and the Aether. He had it on Midgard, in front of their sister. And he had it now."Everybody, prepare to fight-""Brother, stop!" Loki interrupted him.Thor turned to look at him with an even stupider expression etching his features: "Brother-""He wants me," Loki said.Thor couldn't answer. It was Brunnhilde who spoke: "Who? Who is it!?"Loki was scared to even utter his name: "Thanos..."The name earned him a look of disbelief from Valkyrie and one of confusion from Thor. Brunnhilde's expression then morphed into one of rage and betrayal. She grabbed Loki by the neck and slammed him against the back wall: "The Mad Titan!? What business do you have with him!?"Loki looked at Thor, who was still too stunned to do anything: "I failed him... Years ago he sent me on Midgard to retrieve something he needed, but I was thwarted..." he said, trying to speak around Brunnhilde's hand crushing his windpipe.Thor's eyebrows rose in realization."Yes, brother," Loki confirmed what Thor had just realized, "he found me when I fell into the void... He gave me the scepter, sent me after the Tesseract... It's me he's after, I failed him years ago and now he comes to exact his vengeance... Thor, he is the most powerful being in the universe... The scepter held an Infinity Stone, but he had another one in his possession... we don't stand a chance against him..."Valkyrie jerkily let him go. Thor's expression hardened again: "We'll see about that," he growled."Thor, for once in your life, liste
