Chapter 1: Abstract
    




Chapter Text

The phenomenon of soulmates is one of nature’s least understood wonders. The subject is often considered taboo—rife with religious and spiritual implications—and at the very least is considered immensely personal. And yet this phenomenon affects every single human on this planet. 
Despite the delicacy of the subject, it is something that must be discussed, because a lack of understanding only leads to disappointment and dismay over a popularly-understood ideal  which differs significantly from the actual experiences of human beings in (and out) of love.
An Abandoned Cabin, Russia, 2014
The file spread across the table revealed every secret of Natasha Romanoff’s life.It was all online now, which was her own fault. It might have been Fury’s plan, but Natasha was the one who took down the firewalls. Fury and Pierce gave the permissions, but Natasha pressed the button. Every report written and piece of intel gathered was online for the entire world to see, including her file, and it was no one’s fault but her own.She had anticipated that she would need to go to ground. She’d printed a copy of her file, so she would know what sins the Congressional sub-committees might resurrect to damn her with. She hadn’t thought she would learn something about herself, that SHIELD might know something she didn’t.Natasha absently rubbed her left wrist, massaging the burn scars that had been there for as long as she could remember. She didn’t remember being burned, not anymore; that memory was long lost in the sea of childhood traumas visited on her by the Red Room. They didn’t want their operatives knowing the Words their soulmate might one day say. A true comrade did not need a soulmate, only Mother Russia.With her Words lost before Natasha had even learned to read, she had long given up on discovering her soulmate. The purpose SHIELD had given her and the trust she'd found with Clint and Phil—that was happiness enough.In the end, she supposed it was too good to be true.“You should not be here.” He spoke in flawless Russian, like it was the only tongue he had ever known. She now knew that to be a lie as well.It should not have surprised her that in the life of a liar nothing turned out to be true.She did not turn to look at him. Instead, she stared at one image from her file, an image she had not known SHIELD possessed, an image they had kept from her.Had Phil known? Had he kept this from her too?“You once told me to trust no one,” Natasha said. She reached out and ran her fingers across the neat, black Words in the photo. “You were right.”He did not respond. Instead he sat down at the table across from her, finally coming into her view.The Winter Soldier was many things, but above all else, he was beautiful. He had the tightly coiled strength of a jungle cat, a strength he could never quite hide behind a relaxed saunter and casual lounging.“An asset cannot afford to trust,” the Soldier agreed. He reached out with his flesh arm, his fingers skimming across a photo of Natasha laughing with Clint and Steve, all three of them dressed in their SHIELD uniforms. She remembered that picture. Phil had taken it with a goofy smile on his face.Clint had teased him. “Taking a picture of your idol?”“No,” Phil had answered. “My family.”Natasha had believed that. On some level, she’d believed they were family.Now, as she pressed her fingers into the black Words that had been written on her wrist, the words she'd never seen until now, she didn’t know what to believe.“I was a child once.”Natasha looked up, startled by the Winter Soldier’s words. The Soldier spoke sparingly, using the fewest words to get his point across—so different from Clint and his ever-present chatter.“We were all children once,” Natasha said after a moment, when it seemed he was going to say no more without prompting.The Soldier still stared at the photo of Natasha, Clint, and Steve, his fingers tracing Steve’s image. The Soldier’s brow was contorted in an expression that Natasha could only describe as lost, though the thought made her uneasy.He had been one of the few steady things in her life with the Red Room. His teachings had been the foundation on which her life had been built. What did it mean if her foundation was lost?“I did not remember,” the Soldier finally said.“But now you do?”“I remember…” His fingers paused on Steve’s face.Suddenly his metal arm pinned her hand to the table, pressing it into the image she was touching. His blue eyes flamed with belief, and Natasha could not move under the power of that gaze.“I remember what I taught you,” he said. “Trust no one. Love is for children.”Natasha could not look away. She could not even nod. Not from the eyes that had watched her over the decades, not from the eyes that knew her every strength and weakness.The Winter Soldier lifted his hand, and Natasha instinctually pulled her hand back to herself. The Soldier picked up the image she had been obsessing over, the image s
