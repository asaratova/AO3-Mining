Chapter 1: Scrapbook Memories
    




Chapter Text





When asked about it later, Darcy Lewis would always refer to it as the “scrapbook” time.  Despite lasting almost a year, she considered it as a single unit of time – a unit made up of snapshots and choices that irrevocably changed her life and its direction.  She just did not realize it at the time.  Someone asked her if she would change anything.  She laughed.“Nope,” she answered.  A soft smile lingered on her lips and lightened her eyes.  “I wouldn’t change anything.  I wouldn’t risk it changing everything.”When she looked back, she could honestly say Thor’s appearance might have changed her worldview, but his disappearance is what started the change of her life’s direction.

They stared at the slowly clearing sky for several long minutes.“It’s gone.”Darcy turned at the soft words.  Her boss, Doctor Jane Foster, looked lost.  Thor was gone, back to Asgard to deal with his brother and whatever else awaited him.  For a brief moment, they had seen a rainbow of lights gleaming high overhead and then it just…shattered.  Darcy could not think of any other words for it.  She had never seen light break like that – jagged shapes of bleeding colors.  Tears pricked at her eyes.“Gone.”Jane’s quiet, broken breath drew Darcy’s attention back once more.  She turned and started towards the van.  She could hear the others following her.  As they sat, motionless once more, she looked over at her boss as the astrophysicist flipped through her notebook.  “Now what?”Jane’s chin went up and determination flared in her eyes.  “We get him back.”

That had been the start alright.  The three of them went into overdrive – energy readings, odd light occurrences – anything and everything Jane could lay her hands on or dream up in order to find a way to reconnect with Thor.  Then they got the letter from Darcy’s school.Her time on internship was coming to an end.  She needed to turn in her paperwork and prepare to graduate.  She would no longer have a stipend to live on.  It shocked the three of them.  They had become so focused on Thor, and completely forgot Darcy’s original reason for being there.

Darcy glanced up as the door opened.  Dark suit? Check.  Stoic expression? Check.  Sunglasses at night? Check.  She rolled her eyes.  “Well, well, look what blew in on the devil’s wind.”  She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest.  “What are you doing out this way, Agent Sneak Thief?”“Miss Lewis.”  Agent Sneak Thief, otherwise known as Phil Coulson, gave her a nod.  “I am here to discuss security measures with Dr. Foster.”  He glanced around.  “Is she available?”“That way,” Darcy answered, pointing towards the roof.  She could not see his eyes behind the shades, but she got the distinct impression he was rolling his eyes.  She shrugged.  “Her numbers aren’t coming out the way she thinks they should.  It’s been a Mr. Hyde day.”“And Dr. Selvig?”She grinned.  “He’s at the bar.”  He raised his eyebrow and she widened her eyes in response.  “What?  I told you, it’s been a Hyde day.  He can get just as lost in the science, but she takes the moodiness to a whole new level of attitude.”“How is her research coming along?”“Where’s my iPod?”He removed his sunglasses and they stared at each other.  He took a deep breath.  Darcy felt her lips curve slightly at the edges.  “You are very persistent, Miss Lewis.”“Hey, thirty brand new downloads…listened to exactly once!”  She pointed at an accusing finger at him.  “All of my playlists meticulously gathered and carefully arranged based on need, weather, season, and mood.  Not just my moods, mind you; I’m talking about Jane’s moods too.  Jane asked me to make nice; she didn’t tell me I had to be helpful.”One corner of his mouth appeared to quiver.  She blinked.  His face seemed as still and stoic as ever.  She rolled her eyes.“So, is there anything else you need, Mr. M.I.B.?  I’d wait until morning to talk to Jane.”  She tilted her head in consideration.  “Actually, considering her sleep schedule lately, I’d wait until late morning.  If you walk through the door before she’s had two full cups of coffee, you might face bodily harm.” He frowned.  “Has something in particular been happening to set her off?”“Yeah, kind of,” she sighed.  “Or rather, it’s something on top of everything.”“Such as?”She shrugged.  “Thor’s disappeared, and she’s trying to recreate an Einstein-Rosen bridge she knows will work despite having no firm sure idea of how.  Erik is playing devil’s advocate, just to keep things realistic he says.  To top it all off, my internship is ending in a couple of weeks, and I’ve got to go home because I won’t get the university stipend anymore.”  Darcy slumped back in her chair.  “It’s been a pain-in-the-ass week.”He folded his arms across his chest and lowered his chin.  After spending several moments in silence, he looked up at her.  “SHIELD’s agreement with Dr. Foster in regards to her research does include a
