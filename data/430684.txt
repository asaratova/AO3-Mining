Tony?- Steve No, Bruce.- Bruce Darn it. Sorry, Bruce, but do you have Tony’s number? My phone seems to have switched everyone’s numbers or something. I accidentally texted Natasha with a shopping list request meant for Pepper. I think I’m lucky to be alive.- Steve Jesus, you really are. I’ll forward it to you now. Thank God you asked who it was first.- Bruce What do you mean?- Steve Well... you know. Don’t think I’d have appreciated the sorts of things you and Tony text each other.- Bruce What, funny anecdotes about kittens?- Steve I was referring to the inevitable dirty texts you clearly send 24/7, but yeah, the kitten thing would drive me nuts.- Bruce And then it would be goodbye Colorado.- Bruce You’re in Colorado?- Steve Hang on, wait a minute – dirty texts? Do you mean texts about... fondue?- Steve I’m officially in Idaho right now, but yeah. Took an impromptu holiday. It’s pretty great. And yeah, I mean texts about fondue. Hot, heavy and explicit fondue parties.- Bruce That is disgusting, Bruce Banner. I would never text Tony about that sort of thing. Do people really do that?- Steve Oh yeah. Steal Clint’s phone or something and read all his texts from a certain fiery Russian.- Bruce What?!- Steve Oops. You didn’t hear it from me.- Bruce - Hey, Clint. Can I ask you something?- Steve THIS IS THOR, BUT YES, YOU MAY POSE A QUESTION- Thor Damn! I really thought I’d got the numbers right this time. It’s OK, don’t worry. I don’t think you’ll know the answer. Thanks, though.- Steve HO, DO NOT BE SO QUICK TO JUDGE MY MIDGARDIAN KNOWLEDGE, FRIEND STEVE! I HAVE PICKED UP MUCH OF USE DURING MY STAY IN YOUR REALM. WHY, YESTERDAY EVE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WAS ABLE TO COOK YOUR FAVOURITE DISH! I BELIEVE YOU HAVE DUBBED IT ‘TOAST’. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS SURELY A FEAST FIT FOR A KING, IF NOT FOR A GOD! INDEED, I ATE FOUR LOAVES!- Thor This hasn’t really got much to do with toast. It’s more to do with etiquette.- Steve THEN, BRING FORTH YOUR QUESTION!- Thor I might pass, actually. Really. Thank you.- Steve FRIEND STEVE, I WOULD BE HONOURED TO HELP YOU. MY BODY MAY BE IN COLORADO, BUT MY SPIRIT IS ALWAYS WITH MY DEAR FRIENDS. I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY AS YOUR COMRADE TO ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. ALSO, THERE WAS THAT TIME MY FATHER THREW ME OUT FOR BEING SELFISH AND I ALMOST CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF THREE REALMS. THAT WAS WHAT I BELIEVE YOU WOULD DUB A ‘LEARNING CIRCLE’.- Thor Learning curve, actually. And you’re in Colorado? That’s a coincidence! Bruce is there too! Have you run into each other?- Steve PLENTY!- Thor OH- Thor NO, NOT AT ALL- Thor I’m going to ask someone else. I’m also going to ask Coulson if he has any bleach for my brain.- Steve THAT MAY BE WISE, IN HINDSIGHT. GOOD LUCK, FRIEND!- Thor - Is this Clint?- Steve Not even slightly.- Natasha Oh, for the love... this is getting ridiculous. My phone seems to have been possessed.- Steve Yes, by the spirit known as ‘Tony’s Boredom Induced Bad Decisions’. It’ll wear off as soon as he ejaculates, probably. Did you need Clint for something?- Natasha That is the most explicit text I have ever received. I did, actually, although now that I think of it, you may be able to help me.- Steve Shoot.- Natasha It’s sort of a delicate subject.- Steve I’m great with those. Really. Kid gloves and all that. Touch of a woman.- Natasha It’s about... oh goodness, I don’t even like writing it out.- Steve Come on, Rogers. Give me more to work with. How much clothing is generally involved?- Natasha Well, I guess you could do it fully clothed, but- Steve ...?- Natasha Sorry, just trying to work out a way to word it. Can’t think of anything. OK, just going to type it out. Dirty texting. Oh Jesus. It looks so vulgar.- Steve You think that’s vulgar? Pickpocket anyone in New York and peek through their inboxes. I guarantee you’ll find something that makes you want to throw up the memories of everyone you’ve ever loved and then curl up into a ball and cry.- Natasha Is that your opinion on it, then?- Steve No, but then I’m not an uptight frozen soldier half-virgin from the 1940s.- Natasha Kid gloves, huh?- Steve - Please be Tony.- Steve Speaking.- Tony Oh, thank the Lord.- Steve Hey, don’t take Thor’s name in vain like that. Did you want something?- Tony Oh, ha ha. And yeah. I was kind of hoping maybe- Steve I may be a genius, my dear, but even I have not yet perfected the art of telepathy. You’ll have to be a little more specific.- Tony Fuck- Steve Well, it’s a little more direct than usual, but all right.- Tony Hello?- Tony Steve?- Tony - If this isn’t Clint I am going to shoot myself in the face.- Steve Woah, hold up there. It’s Clint. Something up?- Clint No, I usually go around threatening to shoot myself in the face. Of course something’s up!!- Steve I didn’t know you were fluent in sarcasm. Stark rubbing off on you in more ways than one, huh?- Clint Sorry. I really could do with some advice.- Steve Yeah, I got that from the face-shooting thing. What’s up?- Clint Look,
