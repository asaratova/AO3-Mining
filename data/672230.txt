Chapter One – Negligence and Breathing Exercises
 Harry James Potter, aged twenty, sighed once again as he scratched his forehead lightly. He stared at the open folder on his desk in irritation. He didn’t want to be here, least of all after hours, but then if he had wanted a nice, normal nine to five job, he wouldn’t have chosen to be a S.H.I.E.L.D agent. Nothing with S.H.I.E.L.D, standing for the Strategic Homeland Intervention; Enforcement and Logistics Division, was ever normal and perhaps it was that that let Harry fit right in.His watch clicked over to eleven at night and he sighed, which was partly a groan of frustration and annoyance. He hated top secret information that required his immediate attention. Well, strictly it wasn’t his attention it required, but his superior’s, but as the man was disgustingly lazy, he delegated it to Harry, even though Harry was very sure his eyes were not supposed to be looking at this sensitive information. He was a very young, junior agent, who wasn’t even legal to drink in this country, no, he was very sure this folder wasn’t meant for his eyes, or any of the other folders that had been delegated to him in the past.  Turning the page he nibbled on the end of his pen as he read through the sheets in the folder carefully, moving his notepad closer to him before bending over it to scribble some notes in preparation for his final report, which had to be on his superior’s desk by seven in the morning. He smothered a yawn behind his hand, his third in as many minutes. Twenty years old he might be, but he was suffering from the barrage of consecutive very late nights and the even earlier mornings, coffee and potions could only help him so much and he was sure his health was deteriorating because of it. Madam Pomfrey would have flayed him alive if she’d seen him living like this.Thinking of the stern, yet kindly matron brought back memories that Harry would much rather forget, of a time he would much rather forget. He swallowed the painful memories of the war and subconsciously rubbed his left hip, where a permanent scar remained as an unforgiving, painful reminder to all that had happened and all that he had lost.The war had taken everything from him; everything but his own life and sometimes he wished fervently that that hadn’t been the case. He would have gladly swapped places with every single person who had died at Hogwarts that day, after everything had been done and finished and the dust had settled on the rubble and the cost of the war became apparent, he had wished that it had ended differently, if not for those who were already dead, then for himself. He wished that he had had the mercy of joining them in death.Clenching a hand and forcing his mind to go blank, Harry sighed heavily as he realised that he had been lost in thought for twenty minutes and he still had a quarter of the last folder to still read through before he could even start on his final report.Pulling a disgusted face he started once more from the top of the page, having forgotten what he had previously read during his day dreaming, jotting down relevant notes and paragraphs to do the write up report for his superior to hand over to his superiors so that it looked like the man had actually done some work in his life.Harry snorted at that thought, since he had arrived here as a fresh eyed intern a year and a half ago, he had immediately been bullied and roped into doing jobs and reports that he knew he wasn’t even cleared to know existed, let alone have permission to be allowed to read through every scrap of Intel S.H.I.E.L.D had on whatever top secret project his superior was supposed to be doing that month.Leaning back to stretch out his aching muscles, Harry took a quick gulp of cool coffee, not even caring that it tasted foul when it was hot, let alone when it was almost stone cold, he just needed something to wake him up as much as possible, before he started reading once more, smothering yet another jaw breaking yawn.Harry had not made very many friends since he had come to America, and it wasn’t any wonder really, he had come only a few months after the war had ended and he hadn’t felt much like socialising with anyone at that time; yet as soon as he decided that perhaps it might do him more good to spend a few hours out of the house that he had been holed up in for months on end by getting a small intern job, rather than staying cooped up and miserable all day, he ended up overworking himself every single day to the point of collapse sometimes, which again left him absolutely no time to socialise outside of a few polite greetings to his colleagues.It was hard not having any real human contact and he was lonely, he would finish work very late, likely in the early hours of the morning, he would go back to an empty house that he didn’t see enough of to call his home, to get a
