Huh, was Tony's first thought when the spell broke and all of a sudden his brain came back online. He rolled his eyes up from the cock in his mouth -- very nice, uncut, just the right size to suck for a while -- and found Bruce staring down at him."I'm just going to," Bruce said after a moment, then slid out and unstraddled his chest, which let Tony see that yes, that was indeed Captain America's cock up his ass. Steve was still in most of his uniform, wearing an expression vaguely like someone had just shot a kitten in front of him. Possibly a kitten painted in the stars and stripes. "Oh my God," he said.Tony reacted just in time and locked his legs around Steve's hips. "No!" he said. Steve gawked at him. "No yanking!" Tony said. "Yanking is extremely bad. Slow, gentle withdrawal.""I -- " Steve said, faintly, and then he swallowed and nodded and pulled carefully out. And out. And out. Wow. Tony craned his head up long enough to get a full view, for later mental re-enactment purposes, and then let himself flop back onto the grass."Where are we?" he said, staring up. There was a tree overhead. "Are we still in the city?""Somewhere in Central Park?" Bruce said."Sheep Meadow," Steve said. He still sounded dazed."Well, that's on YouTube then," Tony said. It was always nice when the Internet relieved him of the boring hassle of cover ups. "What happened to everyone else? Where's my suit?""It's here, it's folded up," Bruce said. Tony found that feature handy on several occasions before, if not previously one just like this. He made a mental note to stock the suit with condoms and a toothbrush. "Clint and Natasha are, uh, over by the next tree.""Really?" Tony said, debating whether he had the energy to sit up for that. Regretfully he didn't think so. His body was checking in with more detailed reports at this point, and he was becoming fairly sure that this hadn't been the first round of festivities. Amora was going to get two repulsors to the head next time he saw her: he couldn't remember a damn thing."Are you okay?" Bruce said."Yeah," Tony said, waving a hand. "Pepper gives me a get-out-of-the-doghouse-free card every time I save the world and I'm up to three, so even if she gets picky and counts this as two, I'm still in the clear."He managed to crane his head up enough to see that Natasha was already dressed and Clint was zipping his pants up, nothing more to see over there. She was giving him a friendly kiss on the cheek thank-you. Well, that was boring. Tony let his head fall back again. "I feel very strongly that at least one of you should bring me a drink and a towel," he added. "Possibly a cigarette." He nudged Steve with a foot. "You. You're supposed to be a gentleman.""I just had sex for the first time," Steve said dazedly. "With you.""Congratulations," Tony said, editing his natural first reaction -- "Victory is mine!" -- as that was probably insensitive enough to eat up his third doghouse card if someone was filming, which actually raised the question, why weren't there cameras in his face and why did it sound like the news helicopters were somewhere in the distance?Making a significant effort, he pushed himself up onto his elbows. "Where's Thor?"#Tony popped open his faceplate once it was clear that fresh hostilities were not on the immediate horizon. "Look on the bright side," he said to Steve. "Someone's having a worse day than you."Barring the slightly awkward hitch in Tony's gait, which had become more than just slightly awkward in the suit, it hadn't been that hard to find Thor. They'd just followed the half-mile trail of what evidently passed for foreplay among Asgardians, which seemed to be roughly equivalent in destructive power to a tornado.Thor and Loki had ended up at the bandshell, after taking down half a dozen of the elms and the statue of Shakespeare. Jarvis had shown Tony an extremely artistic photo taken (from a very safe distance) for the front page of the Times website, with Thor braced against the back wall with his head flung back, and a leaf from one of the elms positioned to tastefully hide Loki's bare ass from view.The bandshell hadn't survived the experience. Thor and Loki were on the floor of the stage now amid the rubble, Loki still on top, staring at each other with amazingly identical expressions of horror on their faces. The interesting thing was that apparently they weren't letting that stop them, since Loki didn't seem to be pulling out and Thor didn't seem to be shoving him off.SHIELD had finally shown up and was chasing away the television crews and the gawkers, only an hour late. Tony was willing to bet that Fury had watched the whole thing with a tub of popcorn until they'd all snapped out of it. He couldn't entirely blame the guy; it sounded good to him, too. At this point it was just the news helicopters, Thor and Loki, and the five of them all standing around awkwardly amid the remaining benches politely waiting.After another ten minutes of waiting, d
