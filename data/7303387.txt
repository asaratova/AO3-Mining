Chapter Text
Tired. That’s all that came to mind when Tony thought back over everything that’s happened since he came out as Iron Man in 2008. He was trying so hard to make up for all his ignorance but it seemed the harder he tried the more he messed up. This life was draining him, he thought he finally found people he could just but it seemed they either stabbed him in the back or just weren’t there when he needed them. Pepper moved on with her life, letting it be known that she couldn’t deal with Iron Man, and the last good thing in his life, Rhodes, he almost got killed.He sat in his empty tower, alone, staring down a sealed bottle of whisky. He wanted so badly to just drown himself in the alcohol but at the same time he felt that wouldn’t have been enough. Suddenly he felt a shift in the air, he looked over his shoulder to see Loki standing there, smiling at him.A body consuming sigh left him, exhaustion settling in. “Loki, you here to kill me?” He stood and faced the god.“Actually, I’m here to collect on that drink you offered.” A bit surprised, he eyed the god before shrugging and walking over to the bar.“Any preferences?” Might as well be friendly to the insane god.“I like tropical things.” Unexpected but he could deal with that. He decided to go simple and make a Piña Colada. While he worked on getting out the ingredients and busying himself with making the drink the god got comfortable at one of the bar stools. “I must admit, I’m surprised that you haven’t made any attempts to call forth that suit of yours or call in back up.”He shrugged, “No back up to call.” The god studied him. He poured two classes and threw in those cute little drink umbrella’s for the hell of it. “Is there another reason you stopped by?”The god took a sip of his drink, “Yes, I’d like to offer you a position, by my side both on the field,” He paused, eyes ranking up and down his body, “and in my bed.” The billionaire’s eyes widened. It seemed kind of sudden, he hadn’t seen much of the god since the Battle of New York and so this seemed a little out of left field.“I’ll admit, I’m curious as to how you came to this decision. Last time we met you threw me out a window.” “This is true, I must admit that I was not in the best state of mind during that time. But you have always fascinated me Anthony. Your genius exceeds all those around you and I’d like to think we have somethings in common.” He raised his eyebrow and motioned for the god to continue. “We are both well skilled in verbal sparing, both men that enjoy the finer things in life, and both know betrayal on a personal level. I watched you struggle when everyone in against you and I can see the exhaustion, it shows right now in the way you’re standing there. Anthony, come with me, let me take you away from these people, they don’t appreciate you and you don’t owe them anything.” During his speech the god had rose from his seat and circled the bar to stand in front of him. Taking hold of his hands and standing over him, looking him in the eyes.He dropped his head to look at the floor. “I don’t want to hurt people anymore.”“That’s fine, we can go anywhere, do anything. Let yourself be free of your company, Ross, those Avengers. Live. We can do it together.”He stood for a moment, eyes closed. And then he just let himself fall into Loki’s body, “I’m so tired.” He whispered into a leather bound chest, arms came up to wrap around him.“I know you are, come on, let me take you away from here.”They stood in silence, everything silent except the faint heartbeat he could here from beneath the god’s chest. “Okay.”That was the last time anyone saw of Tony Stark.
