At the time, Loki had a vague awareness that King Thor's attempts to secure a good marriage were long and convoluted, but he had no notion of why.The diplomat came to the threshold of the house on a balmy afternoon; he wanted to interview Loki, claiming he was following up on a lead for an eligible young man who was comely and clever, and of good breeding.He hadn't mentioned the other prized criterion for which Loki had been selected: that he was a prodigy in seidr. But whenever someone of import indicated an interest in Loki, Loki immediately assumed any potential sincerity was irrevocably entwined with the mages' predictions he would be a full seidrmadr before he was thirty.When the diplomat said “good breeding” like a rich pun, Loki thought he saw this for what it was; a king needed heirs, but the cock and balls between Loki's legs were not a problem for someone with his abilities.Loki set aside his accounting books for Laufey and put down his weaving and needles for Farbauti, his parents settled into their chaises at the back of the little study to supervise, and Loki investigated Asgard's King while His Royal Representative investigated him.The question hovering of why the King of Asgard had turned away from his royal peers to seek a mate from the bourgeoisie remained politely unasked, and gratefully unanswered.The first clue should have been the lengthy courtship Loki's parents demanded—his capitalistic, opportunity-seeking parents, delaying an alliance with the single most powerful man in the kingdom! Loki was flummoxed; neither Laufey nor Farbauti found worrying reports of the King's character, but still they insisted.And Thor, being a gracious king, honored this: Loki enjoyed a luxurious eight months living at court and being wooed by the king—all on the crown's tab.The second clue was that, on the day of their wedding, Loki was already four months pregnant.~That first month at the palace cemented a strong impression of the king: handsome, kind, gracious, pleasant, strong, wise, generous—and everything else an ideal king should be.But he was also huge.To a rare few, the gods saw fit to dole out the graces of shoulders broad enough to fill doorways, a stature two heads higher than the tallest nobles in their heels, and a body great and imposing from thick bone and bullish muscle. But Thor's daunting size was not solely the uncomplicated fact of his dominating proportions; the sheer vitality of his presence—his character, his soul—projected outwards into the space around him. One could not draw near him without sensing one was already touching or, in Loki's case, being submerged in an electrified field.No one occupied space like King Thor, and the man knew it. He liked it.King Thor smiled at him like he was the first rose of May and gifts were delivered daily to Loki's apartments at the palace, but Loki believed Thor's largeness was something he could never get over, even if he one day reached a similar height to the king.It was thrilling to the point of dizziness when just their gazes locked across the room; Thor was made of just the stuff that made him absolutely giddy. During the first few weeks after he moved into the palace, Loki had managed through polite conversations with the great bear of a man in his costly, embroidered silks.Loki was pressingly aware that this man was more beast than most; it was something in his massive hands, the way they draped and grasped whatever they touched, openly hungry and uncivilized despite the correctness of his manners that first month.After that, Loki grew more comfortable; then the king shed a little of his courtly exterior and the predatory circling began, followed by some spontaneous chases through chambers and grounds. By the third month, the gloves had been taken off and decorum burned; King Thor grinned wolfishly at him no matter who was watching, and no alcove, passage, or room was safe to Loki at any hour.
Thrilling.
The first time the king truly got his paws on him, Loki might have fainted. Thrice.~It truly wasn't just Thor: after three electrified days of particularly charged cat-and-mouse around the entirety of Thor's palace, they both gave in with equal relish; Loki let the king have him this time, the wet slit he'd made for Thor with his seidr.Thor chased him into the library and bent him over against a bookcase in the apartments of a noble whom they'd indiscreetly thrown out. His breath was hot on the growing swathe of Loki's bare shoulders as he fumbled Loki's clothing off. Loki's fingers were white-knuckled on the shelves he grasped and Thor was snarling over him, his tan, groping hands looking bigger than should be possible on his young body. Loki remembered the first time Thor had fondled him, his thumbs grazing over his trail of hair, then cupping his cock while Loki marveled at how a single hand could obscure so much skin. Then Loki marveled aloud, an eloquent “Hnnngh,” as two, thick fingers ran over his slit; the persuasive, gu
