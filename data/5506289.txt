Chapter 1: All About Tony, Let's Do This!
    




Chapter Text
Welcome back to the Iron Man re-write! Pairings and such remain unchanged, except that I'm seriously considering adding a lovely side dish of Rhodey/May (May Parker). If you haven't yet read my previous fic in this series, go and read it! It'll give you a good idea of where the characters all are emotionally, especially in relation to each other.
Oh, and one more thing - I had mentioned Erik Selvig in the original roll call at the beginning of 

All the Days of Our Lives: Captain America, the First Avenger

, but I totally forgot all about him when I wrote out the rest of the story! Sorry, Dr. Selvig. I swear I'll go back and write you into the first one at some point. I did remember you for this one, though!

It was the evening after the viewing of the origins of Captain America, and once again all the Avengers both past and present were gathered in King T'Challa's private entertainment lounge. Wanda was once again seated next to Vision (with whom she'd talked long into the night); Vision had posted himself on the couch next to Rhodey, who had insisted on walking again. Tony Stark had a most possessive hold on Pepper Potts, and Wanda didn't need telekinesis to know at once that the two had spent the previous night and most of the following day . . . reconnecting.James Barnes' new arm was still under construction, and this time it was Natasha Romanoff who had him in hand. Steve, looking equal parts amused, scandalized, and smug, was snuggled comfortably in the arms of Sharon Carter. To Sam Wilson's left was Peter Parker, who managed to be sitting equally distant from Tony and Steve. Cooper Barton was very happy to sit on Sam's right, leaving his parents to do disgusting things like hold hands in a large chair. Bruce Banner and Betty Ross were in much the same position as Clint and Laura, as were Thor and Jane Foster, Darcy Lewis and Ian Boothby.His Majesty himself was seated very unobtrusively on the ottoman Vision had claimed the day before. Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Erik Selvig, Scott Lang, and May Parker were all seated at various points around the lounge.So, Iron Man, huh?" said Fury."Can't wait, I'm sure," said Natasha."I'm actually not looking forward to this, if it's what I think it is," said Pepper."You don't want to watch a movie all about me?" Tony spread his hands."Tony," said Rhodey. "Think of where the Suit first came from."Tony's expression changed. "You know what, we can skip this one as far as I'm concerned.""Oh no you don't!" said Steve. "No way I'm letting you get off easy on this one! Anyway, it can't be that much worse than the reports."Laura had picked up the case marked Iron Man, and now marched it over to the DVD player. She opened the case and put the disc in the drive, and came back to sit beside her husband."Oh boy, here we go," Tony was heard to mutter.The first scene to appear was a wide view of desert with mountains in the background. On the ground was a dirt road down which rolled a number of military humvees that were just barely visible, they were so distant and small.Then, as the scene changed to a closer view of the humvees, a song that Wanda heard faintly through Vision's memory as Back in Black blasted through the speakers.Tony grinned and leaned back against his chair, his head bopping to the beat of the music.Steve sighed. "Loud rock'n'roll music," he muttered. "It's been a while." Damn, I've missed hearing him blare it.Inside one of the humvees, a small silver radio was blasting the song. A hand that could only be Tony Stark's held a glass of something yellow with ice in it. In the seat next to him and in front of him, two men in military uniforms shot nervous glances at him. Neither of them appeared to have said so much as a word.Then they saw Tony on the screen for the first time. He was wearing a business suit and a pair of sunglasses. He had, of course, noticed the glances he was getting."Oh man," sighed the real Tony, having a fair idea of what was coming."I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial," he said. "This is crazy. What did I do? ("Nothing except be yourself," said Rhodey rolling his eyes, awash in memories of Tony before Iron Man and the Avengers) I feel like you're going to pull me over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk?" He addressed the soldier, a young-looking fellow, in the seat next to him. "Hey, Forrest!""We can talk, sir," said the young man."Yeah, you're just kind of intimidating at first," said Jane."Oh, I see," said onscreen Tony. "So it's personal?""Uh-huh," said Scott, who had no great love for Tony Stark."Nice to know I still got it," said the real Tony to Jane."No, you intimidate them," said the soldier driving the humvee, the only one who hadn't been shooting glances at Tony.("See?" said Scott.)"Good God, you're a woman," said onscreen Tony with interest. "I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologiz
