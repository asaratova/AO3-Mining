Bucky Barnes drags himself to the Tower and passes out with the voice of some British guy in his ears, informing Sir and the Captain that Bucky Barnes is, is-He closes his eyes, and when he opens them he’s on a couch, hooked up to an IV. It takes a lot out of him not to jerk the IV out of his skin, but he forces his hand down and keeps it in there because it’s helping him, he knows, but there’s something about a needle in the crook of his arm that makes him think of Russian being spoken in hurried whispers between scientists; of his mind being slid out and fucked with and pushed right back in with instructions that he couldn’t do anything but agree to.He’s in a lounge, a big one, bigger than any lounge he’s ever been in- he catches sight of a TV, a kitchen off to the side, a bunch of books in a shelf, a fish tank, and several people in chairs beside the couch Bucky is lying in.There’s Natalia, whose name doesn’t sit right with Bucky now, tapping away at her phone, then a dirty-blonde man in his forties with a bow at his side looking more or less asleep, then Sam, snoring lightly, and next to him is Steve, slumped over, head pillowed on a man’s shoulder, whose dark-haired head is resting atop Steve’s.Something about the man triggers a memory of Bucky’s- it takes him a few moments to muddle through it, to dig up the memory of standing in front of a car and aiming a bazooka at it and scattering bits of metal and the man who looked so much like the man in front of him was gasping when Bucky finally got to him and stood on his neck, shattering his spinal cord.“B- Barnes,” the man- Howard- had said, choking it through blood, eyes wide and not fearful enough.And then the woman, Howard’s wife- she also looks like the man with his head atop Steve’s, she had a kindness that Howard didn’t have, one that the man has etched into his sleeping face- she had seen him, so obviously she had to be put down. She hadn’t said anything useful, just panted in terror and gritted out, “No, nonono, don’tdon’tdon’t-” and let out a scream that cut itself short when Bucky had snapped her neck under his boot.Bucky shudders at the memory, making a low sound that curdles at the back of his throat, and at it four people’s heads snap up.First Natalia- Natasha, Bucky remembers in a flash of non-existent gunfire-  stares at him, and then Clint, sleepy and incoherent, then Sam, snorting himself awake, and then Steve, blurry and slurring his way through, “Wh’t, what happened,” and they all look at him and go silent.The last one to wake up is the man whose parents Bucky killed god knows how long ago, coming awake easy as anything, blinking hard and then meeting Bucky’s eyes steadily.“Welcome back to the world, James Barnes,” the man says, and Bucky flinches.-They tread on eggshells for a while, and Bucky doesn’t blame them.After all, he has to be restrained twice in five days, both times nearly injuring someone in the Tower- Thor the first time, Sam the second- and has to get held down until he comes back to himself.“Sorry,” he hears himself say, both times. Hears himself gasp it, half-sob it. “Sorry, god, I’m sorry, sorry, fuck.”Thor holds him down both times, Steve helping with the second, and they aren’t unkind about it either times. Thor frowns down at him, face tight and oddly understanding, and Steve strokes Bucky’s hair and grips his shoulder and says Bucky’s name, not how Bucky remembers Steve saying it, but this new way.Or, maybe he’s heard Steve say it like this a few times, after one or two life-or-death experiences, back when Bucky was Bucky and no-one else infiltrated his mind when he least expected it.He says it broken, pleading, and then turning familiar and steady, like he believes in Bucky more than anything. More than the God they always went to Church for. Steve suits that tone of voice, always had, and Bucky is used to that voice from Steve, remembers it like muscle memory.Both times, the man- Tony- stands in the background, stiff and unknowing what to do, ready to move for safety, staring at Bucky with dark eyes that never fail to make Bucky think of the woman who he killed next to her husband by stepping on her neck, strangling her scream.-After a week, Steve appears in the doorway to Bucky’s bedroom.It’s his bedroom now, and they’ve made an effort to really make it his, make it Bucky’s, because apparently it’s important and it’s also harder than Bucky imagined, because if Bucky doesn’t even know who he is, how is he supposed to make a bedroom that fits him?So far, the contents of the bedroom are: a made bed, an unloaded gun under the pillow (he’s supposed to go to someone for ammunition), a dresser, a clock, a mirror, an old photograph Bucky doesn’t remember having taken of the Howling Commandos, and a handful of hairties supplied by Natasha.He likes the hairties best. He doesn’t know why yet.“We were thinking,” Steve says, and then stops, falls into parade rest. Bucky’s lips quirk up on habit, and he opens his mo
