Chapter Text
After coming back to London and reuniting with Jane, Thor had to... take off again. But, this time he offered to take Jane and Darcy with him to Asgard. Which, okay. That sounded awesome. So they went to Asgard. It was pretty there (the scenery and the people, let's be honest), but she started getting a creepy vibe from Odin and decided Earth was the place to be.So she went back. Only (and she strongly suspected it was Loki-based fuckery), she didn't go back to London in 2013. No, she went back to London, 1948. Which was... Less than awesome.Freakish stroke of luck, though, she ran into the actual Howling Commandos, who were all, 'Time travel? Let's get you to SHIELD!' and escorted her over to a SHIELD base in Virginia.And once they were satisfied that she actually was from the future and not some sort of Russian spy, Peggy Carter actually wanted her to hang out around the SHIELD base. Probably both for her protection and as a resource of knowledge. That suited Darcy just fine, because she quickly realized that her best chance of getting back to her own time was going to rest with Howard Stark, and she wanted to keep pretty close to him.
 Which led to her current position on her back on his desk with her legs wrapped around his hips. Except... He wasn't at all into it. He was only halfheartedly going through the motions at best. “Howard?”

 He actually paused like he'd forgotten she was there before looking down at her. “Yes, darling?”

 “Yeah, I'm done. Get off me.” She pushed at his bare chest with both hands.

 He backed away almost immediately, but he looked a little confused. “What's wrong?”

 “What's wrong? Seriously?” She sat up, shifting around on her butt until her skirt was pulled back down to a more decent level. “You're about as invested in this as Peggy is in listening to your bullshit excuses. I have other shit to do.”

 An eyebrow arched. “What, exactly, do you have to do?”

 “Literally anything else. Literally anything. There's a stack of paper sitting on my desk that Peggy wants me to type up. I'd even do that at this point.” Darcy rolled her eyes, shaking her head. She hated typing, but her WPM and accuracy were the envy of the ladies in the typing pool. Her eyes moved about, trying to find her discarded clothing.

 The door at the far end of the large shop opened, and Darcy turned to see Tim strolling towards them. He didn't seem to notice Darcy's state of half-undress until he was almost all the way there, and he stared for just a second before turning his back. “Sorry, Darcy. I didn't meant to interrupt.”

 “It's fine. You're not interrupting anything.” She continued the search for her blouse, and finally found it discarded under the desk. The bra was... She glanced at Howard, but he'd already moved away to a workbench, sketching quickly on a sheet of paper to get out whatever had been taking his attention away from her out of his head. “Do you see my bra?”

 He was careful not to turn towards her, but Tim scanned the surrounding area for any sign of the missing undergarment. “I'm not finding it.”

 A look up showed it dangling from the one of the taller bits of machinery in the lab. Howard had been really into foreplay, but inspiration must have struck right around the time that he was unzipping his pants. Which, of course, meant all kinds of frustration for Darcy. “Nevermind.” She pulled the shirt on, buttoning it over her bare breasts. Howard still hadn't put his own shirt back on, though he'd pulled up his pants and done them up. She could borrow it, or his suit jacket, to get back to her room where she could get decent again. “I'm covered.” Well, mostly.

 He turned around, but his blue eyes quickly moved over to watch Howard. “That's... bad timing.”

 “Yeah.” Darcy made a face. “Abandoned in the pursuit of genius. I'd complain, but it wouldn't do much good. Besides, I'm hoping he's working on the time machine. Not that I don't love it here...” She shook her head again, sighing. “Hey, you wanna grab something to eat? I mean, I need to go get changed first, but...” His eyes swung over to her, and there was no mistaking the look in them. He'd shown some interest in her when they'd first met in London, but he hadn't pursued anything. Neither had she, not knowing how long she'd be staying. Now, though... That was a mustache 
made
 for a mustache-ride. Plus, if Howard was going to ditch her for science, he totally deserved to be ditched for someone else. “You could help me.”

 Tim glanced over at Howard again before his attention came back to her. “Aren't you Howard's girl?”

 She shrugged. “We fuck occasionally, but science is his one true love. You could probably bend me over this desk right now, and he wouldn't even notice.” Tim's eyes darkened as she said that, she could tell he was actually considering it. “Or we could just grab lunch. Or... whatever.” Darcy
