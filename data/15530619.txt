Chapter 1





Chapter Text
1940’s…..“Steve…..Stevie….my alpha, I don’t care if you can NEVER knock me up with your pups, I just want you...I swear baby.” Bucky mumbles into his alpha's neck, scenting him, has been for awhile now in their tiny brooklyn apartment.It was funny how some thought Steve was the one who had gone to Bucky first since he is the alpha and asked him to be his mate, but na it had been Bucky, the blonde was so unsure of himself at the time, but he came around, of course he did, Steve knew same as Bucky that they were it for each other.Steve may have been small and skinny, but boy did it do something for the brunette when his little spitfire of a alpha would fight for him, sure half the time Bucky had to step in and help, but….that was just another thing that was different with them, sure Steve got pissy about it for a bit, but then he would settle and admit that yes he had needed the help.Granted Bucky normally had to pull that last bit out of him, but still. They were in a better place now, finding that balance and closeness so many had, honestly the pup thing was the last thing on Bucky’s list, he just needed Steve.Steve just grumbles something under his breath, but holds Bucky more tightly, running his small artist fingers through the brown strands of hair making the omega melt in his arms. The scent of calm and love filling the space.                             _________________________________2014….The asset…..knows this scent…..HE KNOWS IT!“Bucky?” The blonde man ask and suddenly….it’s like a life that was locked away from him for so long is right there again, bright and all knowing…..the blonde man is….“Steve?”Suddenly the smell of pine trees, ink and something that just screams…..alpha...home fills his nose and it sinks into his skin and bones, has his body standing up straighter and he just….whines like he hasn’t ever in his life.The clang of Steve’s shield hitting the ground is first, followed by strong protective arms cradling him to the blondes chest, the asset…..Bucky…..keeps whining such a sad heart broken thing as he wraps his arms around his mate, metal one and all.Steve just holds him that much tighter, offering his old deep sounding purr to help calm his omega. TBC.....
