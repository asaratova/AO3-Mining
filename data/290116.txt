Chapter Text
He hadn’t meant to say it, to just blurt it out like he had no mind for the consequences. In fact, if he was being honest with himself, he hadn’t meant to tell Erik at all, at least not until he’d decided what was to be done with the matter. He hadn’t wanted anyone to know, not outside of Hank who’d been the one to discover it. It was, unequivocally, frighteningly unknown territory, and Charles had done his best to tuck his situation away to the back of his mind and do his best to pretend it wasn’t a reality. The Russians and the Americans were on the verge of destroying themselves and likely the planet, and so it was an easy thing to do, to pretend, to hide.In fact, he’d done such a good job at hiding it, that the matter had slipped his mind completely. In the mornings there was terrible nausea, often which resulted in Hank hovering worriedly behind him in the bathroom with a cup of tea waiting for it to pass, but afterwards, there was little evidence. Sometimes the nausea persisted, mildly so, into the evening hours, and Charles found himself growing more tired with each day, but there was nothing that wasn’t handled.“You can’t ignore it,” Hank said, voice tight with apprehension.But Charles did. There were more pressing matters. He hadn’t the time or energy to think of how it had happened, what type of mutation was the cause, or possible solutions. And until such time as he had to think of it, Charles thought it was best that Erik wasn’t burdened. Erik was already so heavy with thought, Charles couldn’t bear to add to it.Charles had, even when the Blackbird had crashed into the beach and Erik had pushed him almost painfully secure to the hull, not even the briefest remembrance in his mind. He was occupied wholly with Shaw, and aiding Erik. He had, foolishly enough, still believed that he could control the situation. He had truly and desperately wanted to believe that he could calm Erik enough and center him, and together they could maintain the situation with as little collateral damage as possible. Charles hadn’t known how terribly wrong he was until Erik slipped from his consciousness and he was startlingly alone for the first time in months.Having Erik gone was … it made Charles want to curl in on himself. It was a horrible feeling of loneliness that Charles could hardly recall from before, when Erik hadn’t had a piece of himself residing in Charles’ mind. It was somewhat frightening to think of how much Erik had come to mean to him, and how much he had seeped into Charles’ very essence. Now, with Erik gone, it was too clear. Erik was missing and it was wrong. The quite hum of German thoughts, the buzzing presence of motherly memories, and the forever weight of pragmatically complex feelings, had absolutely vanished. Charles felt as if a piece of himself had as well.The missiles. Charles had always known Erik capable of so much hurt, so much anger, so much destruction, but they had also been working on the ferocity of positive emotions. Charles had believed that he’d convinced Erik to find his balance. Erik had mumbled to him, often at night as they lay together, “rage and serenity,” and traced his lips across Charles’ shoulder.Now, watching Erik fall apart completely, consumed with the rush of defeating Shaw, Charles knew they had not practiced enough. They had not spoken on the subject at a length in which Erik had found his center. There was no serenity, only rage, and regardless of who it was directed at, Charles felt its sting.Erik called him idealistic. Marxist. Juvenile. Naive. Erik scoffed at his beliefs, and spent a great deal of time worrying about him. Erik, once he had taken Charles into his bed, had opened his mind. His thoughts were for Charles without hesitation, and Charles heard them, floating about, open and unabashed and frighteningly honest. Erik was of the firm belief that the humans, the government in particular, would turn on them without much provocation. Erik fretted endlessly over the idea of the children being abused, the innocent led astray, and Charles being hurt. Those thoughts, the ones that he didn’t dare speak aloud, were the most powerful.The missiles, their trajectory impossible not to comprehend, were validation. Erik wore Shaw’s helmet, and Charles was alone in his mind, and still, Erik’s thoughts were too easily predicted.  The missiles were validations. They were proof. They were Erik’s greatest ally in his cause.And so Charles, who prided himself on his calming nature, his ability to judge his situation and carefully plot his course, panicked. Charging Erik, attempting to wrestle the helmet off him, was perhaps not his greatest moment. Yet it was all he could think to do. His connection to Erik had always been his greatest tool. He had never dared to change Erik’s mind, not with the man’s exceedingly stubborn nature, but it had always provided Erik an extra insight into Charles’ side. It had put them on even footing.
