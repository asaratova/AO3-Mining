Chapter 1: Tony sealed his own fate
    




Chapter Text
Dr. Strange confirmed that Tony's been a walking dead man for 5 years. Because once Thanos had the Time Stone, no one could do anything to stop him. And who decided delivering an Infinity Stone to Thanos was a good idea? The same person who refused to call Steve. So really, Tony can only blame himself. What if someone asked the question?

***
Peter Parker came up to Dr. Strange after the funeral. He asked, "Um, can I talk to you, Mister---I mean Doctor?"Dr. Strange turned and looked Peter up and down. He said, "Yes."
Peter nodded and said, "Oh, good, cool. I-um-I was wondering if you could tell me---"
Dr. Strange rolled his eyes and said, "The answer to the question is yes."
Peter blinked and said, "Um...you know what I was going to ask?"
Dr. Strange huffed and said, "Young man, even if I weren't a master of the mystic arts, your question is so obvious even a fake palm reader could guess it. You want to know if Stark dying was really the only way to win. The answer is yes, because Stark didn't leave the universe any other choice."
Peter blinked again.
Before he could ask a follow-up question, Dr. Strange said, "The universe's---and Stark's---fates were sealed the moment we landed on Titan. Before Thanos had the Time Stone, many possibilities probably existed. But after the stone was within his grasp...then I could see only one path forward. The deaths we experienced on the journey were the price we paid for the victory."
Peter felt his shoulders relaxing. Now that he knew there was no other possibility (and that Mr. Stark pretty much screwed himself over), Peter could return to Queens and pick up his life as Spider-Man with a clear conscience.
