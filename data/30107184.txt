Chapter 1: Scents
    




Chapter Text
Natasha’s scent was…a little different. 	Sure..scent’s were always going to be little different no matter how you slice it..but you really can’t help but…drown in hers. 	She smelled like…spiced peaches in the absolute best way possible. 	Her scent was intoxicating, drowning you in absolute bliss as soon as you come within range. 	She laid next to you on the bed, your body curled into her and your head hiding in the crook of your neck as you practically inhale her scent. She doesn’t mind…surprisingly. 	Nat loved the position you were in, she loved you, and when Clint saw the sight, he was shocked. 	Natasha never liked being touched. Clint made sure to tell you that right from the beginning of your relationship. He didn’t want you to take it any more personal than a normal person could, he was cryptic in why she didn’t like it, but you never pushed. 	She liked that about you. 	Natasha let you touch her the moment she stepped into your bedroom. 	Your room was rather quiet, it wasn’t too industrial, but…ethereal in a sense. No matter who came in your room, they almost seemed to open up instantly in what was going on. It was a wonder that you actually listened to them, it was nice to be treated like a human. 	When Natasha came in, she was a little different. You couldn’t really put your finger on it, it was…relaxing. The usual small smirk on her lips was replaced with an actual smile. She sat on the edge of your bed, patient and ready to listen. 	You really wanted a hug. Her arms were unfamiliar on how to actually hug someone, Clint had to give her lessons on how not to try to strangle someone when attempting to hug them. It was rather hard to be gentle, but she wanted to try. The lessons slowly got easier as she thought of you, your eyes, your soft hair that always needed hair strokes from her, how you melted when she whispered sweet nothings into her ear. When she hugged you, you didn’t mind dying at this moment, because you were in eternal happiness.She loved every bit of you. Including your own scent. When she smelled your scent for the first time, it was an off moment. You couldn’t sleep, you always dealt with insomnia on some level, but it was worse when Nat couldn’t sit with you. You always seemed to smell her and instantly feel at peace. She just got home from a mission and was…rather shocked to see you typing on the computer, your eyes drooping in exhaustion, with a blanket wrapped around you. When she assured you that she was home, you were asleep in seconds. She carried you to bed, and you were limp against her body. She couldn’t help but smell lavender. She had assumed it had been the candles you lit, to help you sleep a little faster, stay asleep a little longer. It wasn’t until she had gently placed her nose to your neck as she smelled the lavender, laced with…bergamot? She fell in love with the scent.  More in love with you. When Clint came in to bring your computer, you were practically drowning in bliss as you slept peacefully, Nat had taken a shower and came to bed with you, your head nuzzled into her shoulder as your breath tickled your neck. Nat hid a smile under the Y/N, her eyes eying you every few minutes to make sure you were still sleeping. Clint had lowered his voice to a whisper as he knocked gently. The muffled “Come in” gave him permission as the door slid open.Clint actually seeing Natasha being soft was…a sight to say the least. He noticed that Natasha was…deathly still as you were sleeping. Clint always accompanied you when you couldn’t sleep and Nat was on a longer mission than expected, he didn’t exactly understand why you were so understanding. How you just smiled it off around her when you were suffering with sleepless nights and constant panic when you were alone.  The fact that you held such a burden of not wanting to hurt her, hurt him.Clint told Natasha as you were sleeping for the first time in a week. He just didn’t expect Natasha to almost cry. To his defense, he kept it as cryptic as possible, only stating what he saw, not what you told him in exhausted confidence.Natasha never shed a tear in her life. She knew how to fake it for a mission, or to get some information, but she never felt sadness. It was a dull feeling for her that made her weak, like a child. She also said love was for children, and when she saw you, she was right, she felt like a kid again. How you were so patient and warm with her despite Nat’s not so great moments, how you just had that ability to make her smile and to listen to you. It was like no other. Natasha didn’t know that you couldn’t sleep without her. She had suspicions, but you always seemed to brush it off. It happened with a lot of your problems actually. How when you twisted your ankle in training, it was hidden so well, no one really knew until after you were benched from a mission two weeks later. When you were sick, you hid yourself in your room with the excuse you were having a binge night alon
