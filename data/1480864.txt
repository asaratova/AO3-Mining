Chapter 1: All Work (And No Play) - Merida/Elsa
    




Chapter Text
Elsa looked back down to her paperwork. Her father had mentioned once that her job would be much harder than it looked, and she knew now that he was not kidding. The stacks of papers that she needed to sign grew by the day, until they rivaled the North Mountain itself. Though she no longer wore gloves, she still had to focus on her hands, doing the best to get work done and yet not getting cramps in her hands.If she never had to sign another paper again in her life, then she was sure that her life would improve dramatically."But," she told herself, picking up another paper from the stack. She read over it. Even if she didn't always sign it, she still had to read it. There was always a chance that someone could try to get her to agree to something awful. "This is just how it is."She sighed.Other than the sound of her pen scrawling down her signature, there was no other noise in Elsa's study. No one wondered in, though she did sometimes hear the shouts of Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf from somewhere else in the castle. If she got some more work done than she would go see what they were up to."Just get through this," she told herself, dropping her pen and flexing her fingers. "Soon enough this will all be over."The sound of her pen scrawling soon returned. Most of the things that she was sent were rather reasonable. After all, who would want to mess with a queen who could control ice and snow?The door jerked open, and Elsa let out a small gasp. She turned around."Ooh, sorry," Merida said, taking a step back. Her bright red hair blocked some of her face, and she wiped it away. "I promise that I didn't mean to scare you, Elsa.""Oh," Elsa responded, her eyes turning back to her paperwork. "Just knock next time, please.""Yes.." She looked away from her. "I was just wondering if you wanted to go outside with us. I'm teaching Elsa and Kristoff how to shoot, and I figured you might want to be around to make sure that they don't hurt anyone.""Oh," Elsa said again. "Yes, I suppose that I should. I don't want my sister and friend hurt."Merida squinted over her. "Elsa, I told you not to worry about those papers so much; it's not good for you. My mum will tell you the same thing if you ask her."Elsa sighed. "I know. Still, it needs to be done."Merida smirked. "You definitely need a break." She raised an arm, flexing it. "I thought you would want to see me put these muscles to good use."Elsa chuckled. "You are certainly better than a pile of papers that need to be signed.""Definitely!" Merida motioned her forward. "Hurry up, we need to get going before something happens."Elsa moved forward, wrapping her hand around Merida's own. Merida's hands were larger than her own, and she rubbed Elsa's palm with her thumb. She used all her energy to keep up with the red head.If she noticed some of the papers falling off of her desk as she ran away, then she didn't bother with them.
