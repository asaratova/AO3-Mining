Splintered Mind

Natasha
The sun edged across the horizon in front of her as she ran. Insomnia and frustration sent her out of the Tower to run, and she’d followed her favorite route up through Central Park, then back again. The chill slicked over the raw images her brain kept on a loop even as the steady pound of her feet helped erode the tension embedded so deep into her muscles she would likely never relax again.A week.A week since Ross had been outed to the committee and the world. Congress had called for hearings. The President had called for his resignation. The U.N. called for his arrest. The public salivated for all the dirty details courtesy of the press excoriating him.The headlines were hard to miss. Every news program lead with his name, or some new salacious detail—most was pure speculation. But Natasha hadn’t been forgotten in the fuss. No, she might be the second or third story, but she was still up there. Any time they floundered for something more on Ross they wanted to dissect whether or not the Black Widow had truly tricked him or was really that unstable.If only winning hadn’t meant losing. Still, the bargain remained acceptable in her book. Barely thirty minutes after the recordings enjoyed their first public hearing, the U.N. Committee struck a deal with Steve that included skipping house arrest and public monitors. They dumped the whole mess at Ross’ feet.The Avengers were once again legal and back in business.Well, all except for her. The warrants were still out there, multiple governments declared their intention to call for her extradition, and the espionage charges were just waiting to loop their noose around her neck. No, Natasha Romanoff aka Natialia Romanova aka Black Widow remained persona non grata or as she was beginning to think of herself—the Avengers’ dirty little secret that not all knew she was there.Currently, it was on a need to know basis and limited to Tony, Steve, James, and Clint. She’d spoken to Clint on the phone once and over text messages several times, but he was at the Compound undergoing physical therapy and recuperation. Laura and the kids were due to arrive in the next couple of days, which meant she really had to keep her distance.The Compound security kept the press away, but they were still camped at the gates trying to get the money shots of returning Avengers. They’d gotten a picture of Sam the day before despite his attempt to slip in unnoticed by flying in. The photo was on the front page of all the news sites before lunchtime.Steve had left to meet him and hadn’t returned until late. She’d pretended to be asleep rather than catch up on all things Sam. It was petty and selfish, and she hadn’t even been sure why she’d done it except…Admit it Romanoff, you’re jealous. The word was close, but not quite the right fit. She concentrated on her breathing as she followed the circuit. More and more runners had poured into the park over the last half hour. She’d peel off toward the south entrance and Columbus Circle when she got there. Even with the photo static veil and a knit cap to cover her red hair, she needed to play it cool.Steve had been thrilled Sam was back, both because he was no longer on the run but because he’d also missed him. Oddly enough, when he’d left—James seemed as irritated as she felt. It helped, she’d been able to concentrate on him rather than why it unsettled her.Still, it was stupid that it even bothered her. She had friends, why shouldn’t Steve? He’d missed Sam. He was allowed to do that. James hadn’t even really discussed it, he’d just settled into one of his silent moods. Those had occurred with increasing frequency—maybe because he was getting more sleep. The deep shadows beneath his eyes eased, but didn’t disappear entirely. Though the last three nights, she hadn’t found him up when she’d risen.Currently, they were sharing a suite on Steve’s floor, with her in the extra bedroom. The guys hadn’t said a word when she’d gone to sleep by herself that first night and to be honest, she wasn’t sure why she’d carved out the spot. As the days went by, Steve was absent from the Tower more often than in it and James and she developed the routine that Steve fell in with when he made it in. They had their own rooms, shared a common space, and ate most of their meals with Tony when he was at the Tower.Sweat soaked through her top and she’d already unzipped her hoodie to let the winter air cool her as she followed the split in the path to angle south. It was weirdly like being at the chalet, but not. It was almost like coming home, and yet at the same time…I’m not supposed to be here. I have no place here. The line of thinking had dogged her every move. Withdrawing from the guys was just the first step. Tony had immersed himself into working on the amendments to the Accords, a project he’d invited her to participate in but she remained wary. If she assisted and that came out, it c
