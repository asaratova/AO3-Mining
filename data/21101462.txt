Chapter 1: Arrival
    




Chapter Text
“It’s just an hour Peter, it’s going to be alright, I promise.” Peter Parker’s Aunt May leans over and squeezes the teen’s tense shoulders. The gesture was to comfort him but he is to stressed for it to help. The teen responds to his aunt by exhaling a shaky breath while staring blankly at the building. The one-story cream building wasn’t unfriendly in appearance. With a fenced in play area, little garden decorated with hand painted signs, cheerfully decorated bike rack, and giant community center sign gave the place a friendly and inviting appearance to most people passing by it.  But Peter isn’t like most people. The teen looks average enough with his unkempt brown waves, brown eyes behind thick glasses, summer clothes flopping around his thin frame, but the shiny medical alert bracelet on his wrist and the dog wearing the blaringly noticeable vest at his side are a reminder he isn’t like most people.  Not anymore.  Was he ever normal though? Besides, most people choose to come to a community center willingly. Peter is standing before the building less than willingly.  “The group meets for an hour. I’ll stay near the room but since you’re the one with the service dog, you’ll be going into the room,” his aunt informs him as she nudges him towards the building. “I don’t know Aunt May,” Peter murmurs, “I already have a therapist, I don’t really think I need a support group with strangers too.” “But Peter these people will understand you better. They can answer questions you may have that myself or your therapist or your doctor can't answer since they have service dogs and we don’t.” Peter grips the leash attaching him to his service dog Karen tighter while audibly exhaling. The black lab shifts her sitting position, scooching her butt closer to the teen’s feet in response.   Ever since he had become more stable physically and mentally, his therapist and aunt have been mentioning going to a support group. They say its 'to expand his social circle with people who can understand his situation'. Marvel Community Center has several support groups, community outreach programs, and a friendly atmosphere. But what drew his aunt and therapist to this location out of all other places in New York City is that this location is one of only a few that offer a support group for individuals with service dogs. His therapist suggested this support group because it’s a lighter topic in comparison to all the other things that have happened in Peter’s life. In fact his therapist and his aunt suggested it at least once a week for two months. It was that once a week conversation that finally wears away at Peter’s denial until this point: agreeing to go to one meeting to get them to stop bringing it up.  “Oh look, that must be Mr. Coulson!” His aunt draws his attention to a man in dress pants and pale polo coming towards them with a smile. The short man comes up to a stop before the pair with a big smile on his face. “May and Peter Parker I assume?” “You must be Mr. Coulson,” May shakes the man’s hand, “it’s a pleasure.” “Pleasure is mine and please call me Phil,” the man adds as he turns to Peter. “It’s nice to meet you Peter,” he holds out his hand. Peter nods while shaking the man’s hand, “nice to meet you too sir.”  The man nods and claps his hands together, “shall we get going?”  Peter follows the two adults with a ‘up Karen’, the black lab falling into step beside her handler. Mr. Coulson guides them towards the front door of the building. “Sorry for the early morning time frame on a Saturday but we like to have the meeting scheduled when there are less kids and programs going to prevent stress for the attendees. This is supposed to be a relaxing time of bonding between members of the meeting.”  “That sounds reasonable. How many people usually attend?” May probes as they reach a front desk where a woman sits typing on her computer and only acknowledges them with a glance.  “Well the group ranges from five people to ten depending on the day. Every other month we have one day where we schedule an extra meeting for the group so they bring their loved ones to participate. Those days the number is a bit higher.”  Mr. Coulson takes a paper from the woman who had stopped typing and hands it to Peter’s aunt. “forgive me but we do have guardians fill out a basic sign-in form for underaged attendees. Also in case something happens with Peter during a session, we would like to have the information on what to do.” “Of course,” May snatches up the page and begins filling it out swiftly, finishing in record time compared to the last few times she’s had to fill out forms for the teen.Coulson takes the sign-in page from May, handing it to the secretary after glancing it over himself.  “I’d like to stay nearby in case Peter needs me,” May adds as Coulson directs the pair down a hallway to the left with several art decorated doors. “Absolutely,” the man nods, “I don’t lead the meeting, one of our council
