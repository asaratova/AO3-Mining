Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
Everyone's day started off normally, Tony was in his lab working on the latest upgrade for the Stark phone, Peter and his class were all ready to start their classes for the day May was working, and the Avengers were all relaxing in the common room on a rare day off, when suddenly they were all teleported away.When they came too they found themselves in a large room that looks almost like a theatre, with a large screen at the front."Kid you alright?" Tony asked when he saw Peter sat beside him. He noticed the others in the room, but Peter was his priority."I'm good, what are we doing here?" Peter questioned. Tony shrugged, he was just as clueless as Peter."Well that makes me feel so much better that you've got no clue what's happening." May laughed sarcastically."Is that Tony Stark? Wait the rest of the Avengers are here too!" Flash called out, 'seriously is that the first thing you think of when you wake up after being teleported away' Tony thought incredulously."More importantly, what are we doing here?" One of Peter's classmates asked as everyone turned to Tony and the Avengers for answers."Don't look at me I'm just as clueless as you are, and I don't have access to FRIDAY." Tony said frustrated after trying and failing to communicate with his AI."So, May, Tony Stark and The Avengers are here as well as Peter's classmates, so my guess is that we're all here because of Peter." MJ stated plainly. Flash looked at her incredulously whereas Tony looked impressed at MJ, but before he could respond a voice spoke up."You would be correct Michelle Jones. We are all here today to watch a wonderful movie about you'reÂ  dear friend Peter Parker." A mysterious voice spoke out seemingly from no where. "I suggest you get comfortable, this may take a while." The voice added sinisterly. Peter couldn't help but be filled with dread as everyone stared at him in confusion. They all took their seats as the screen lit up and the movie began.
