Chapter 1: HYDRA Base US 119
    




Chapter Text
"You sure you wanna do this, Cap? We got no intel on how many are in there.”“Aw, we got five Avengers, man, we're good.”“I'm sure, Sam.”“Yeah, see, we're good.”“You don't think that we should maybe focus on our own, you know, very big problems before we go trashing HYDRA bases?”“The situation with Ross and Stark will only get worse the longer I refuse to comply. And I've got no plans of complying. There's no help for that now. It doesn't mean we get to stop doing our jobs.”“...Alright, fine. What's your plan?”“We run on Bucky's intel. Standard infiltration and attack procedure. Neutralize the base and take any data they've been storing on private servers, and we release and aid prisoners, if they have any.”“So...I go in first and take out security. Is that the plan? Or, like, part of the plan? I get lost when all you military guys start using big words, sorry.”“I'd say cutting their security is a good place to start, Lang.”“Cool. See, I'm catching on quick, I'm one of the guys. I've got this. So, I can get all the alarms disabled and then, what? A distraction? Is that something you could use? I'll come up with something ant-related on the way over.”“Can you get us in?”“Oh yeah, I'm excellent at opening doors I'm not supposed to. Leave that one to me.”“Buck. You and I will go in quietly. Who are we considering A-level targets?”“Erik Wentzel and Christopher Montgomery.”“Ex-STRIKE?”“Technicians.”“Like, field engineers, weapons tech?”“Programming, conditioning, and maintenance.”“Of..?“Of me.”“...Jesus, man. Alright. We're with you.”“We run silent until Bucky IDs our guys. Once they're eliminated, he and I will give the green-light to take out any other operatives we encounter.”“Sounds fun.”“Pff.”“Whatever, man, I'm pumped. Fuck HYDRA. Wilson, drop me on the roof. I'll cover Cap and Sarge on the approach and take down any of the bastards who try to wait the raid out up there while you, you know, do circles. Watch the perimeter. Back me up. You been inside this one, right, Barnes?”“Yes.”“Ballpark figure, how many guys we looking at?”“It's not a command station. Just labs. But STRIKE security teams will be on-site. West Seneca's their largest remaining R&D facility. They've moved most of their major projects here. Eighty to a hundred guns.”“So, worst case scenario, we kill twenty apiece. Easy.”“What's our time-table, Cap?”“We're leaving.” CHANNEL-3 >> Shit, Barton's down, Cap!CHANNEL-4 >> Shut the fuck up, Wilson! I'm back up! It just grazed my calf.CHANNEL-1 >> Talk to me, Sam.CHANNEL-3 >> We're in the stairwell. We were on the roof watching the perimeter and something hit us – I don't know, looked like military drones. I counted three. Shot me right outta the sky.CHANNEL-1 >> What's Barton's status?CHANNEL-4 >> I repeat: Barton got an ouchie on his leg and Wilson is a fucking alarmist. Status report over.CHANNEL-1 >> Sam.CHANNEL-3 >> Not hurt, but I'm grounded. Left wing's gone. Sorry, Cap.CHANNEL-1 >> Lang?CHANNEL-5 >> I'm in the walls. Got half the charges set. This place is gonna be a dollhouse when we're done. Sergeant Barnes can take it home later, if he wants to. Therapeutically smash it with a hammer or something.CHANNEL-4 >> Where'd this fucking airstrike come from, Barnes? Me and Falcon are majorly out-gunned up here.CHANNEL-2 >> Army base nearby. They must have control of it.CHANNEL-3 >> Or Ross knows we're here.CHANNEL-1 >> Bucky and I are on sub-level 3. Just hit the labs but they were empty. We're entering the server room now. We'll get their database cleaned out, then go after Montgomery and Wentzel. Sam, Clint, you two work your way down. We'll clear the sub-levels and meet you on the ground floor.CHANNEL-5 >> Just so you're not surprised when you get to the lab on the west side of sub-level 1, these dudes just shucked their underpants.CHANNEL-1 >> What?CHANNEL-5 >> Fire ants.CHANNEL-2 >> Hm.CHANNEL-5 >> Testicles.CHANNEL-1 >> Oh.CHANNEL-2 >> Steve. Got everything.CHANNEL-1 >> Good. Lang, stop playing around and fry the servers.CHANNEL-4 >> Yeah, Scott, quit playing with HYDRA's balls.CHANNEL-5 >> Already on it, Cap–CHANNEL-2 >> Fuck–AH! – ah–CHANNEL-5 >> Shit, shit, shit, did I fry him?CHANNEL-1 >> No, he was clear! – Buck, come on, get up–CHANNEL-2 >> STE–nng–AHH!CHANNEL-4 >> The hell's happening down there?!CHANNEL-1 >> What's–? Bucky!CHANNEL-3 >> Cap, status!CHANNEL-1 >> –God damn it–CHANNEL-2 >> GAH – help – it – AH–CHANNEL-4 >> Steve! Is he holding his ears?CHANNEL-1 >> He—yeah, Barton, do you know what this is?CHANNEL-4 >> I don't know, but I got it, too. Ears are ringing like hell.CHANNEL-3 >> I got no interference, Cap. Lang, are you hearing this?CHANNEL-5 >> Nothing!CHANNEL-1 >> Oh, God—Bucky's down. We need backup—CHANNEL-5 >> Just Barton and Barnes? Cap and Falcon and me are all fine?CHANNEL-4 >> I got a bad headache, but I ain't hearing whatever Barnes is hearing—CHANNEL-5 >> Cap, it's a resonant frequency. Out of our hearing range. An
