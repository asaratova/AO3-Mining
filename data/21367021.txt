Chapter Text
The room was dizzying as the woman tried to regain her consciousness; last thing she remembers was being on patrol. Then she was enveloped in knockout gas and was rendered unconscious. Now here she was tied to a table of sorts with sometype of tube sticking in her. “It look’s like the last subject has awoken Dr. Fump” said a masked man in a bodysuit with a Hydra suit.“Janet Van Dyne, AKA Wasp; a real catch indeed Dr. Cruler” another man in the same attire was next to him in front of the avenger. “Ugh what do you think you two are doing??!!” the size changing hero demanded as she struggled to get out of her restraints. “We’ll should I explain or should you Dr. Fump?” Dr. Cruler suggested. “After you Dr. Cruler” the Hydra scientist answers. “We received a peculiar request from a client to create some powerful super soldiers with powers, so we worked up solution that is both enjoyable and produces results” Dr. Cruler said as he prepped some machines. “We’ve used extensive genetic procedures on all our subjects to be able to pass their desirable abilities to offspring. Once the subject and the employer… procreate the desired genes consummate inside the females’ offspring and then they grow through a somewhat accelerated growth process in pregnancy to save time and resources” Dr. Fump finishes shocking. “You can’t be… wait did you subjects as in plural?” Janet asks. “Of course, we couldn’t just settle on one individual” Dr. Cruler answered as he flipped a switch the lights came on as it showed dozens of heroines and villainesses in the same position as Wasp.  She recognized some: Supergirl, Elektra, Huntress, Vixen, Tigra, and even Crystal. Then there are others: Silver Sable, poison ivy, galatea, knockout, electro, and Viper. The two scientists then began to load sometype of red liquid into the machine which was where the injection tubes from all the captured females were coming from. “What is that?” Wasp asked. “Just a little… insurance” Dr. Fump answers ominously making the females struggle some more to try and get out. “Oh, stop that squirming. Stop the squirming” Dr. Cruler says passing through the captives starting with Mystique. “There’s nothing to be scared of” he says in front of livewire. “Your defeat will be… relatively painless” he went behind Wonder Woman. “It will hardly sting at all. Hehehehe” he chuckles darkly between Emma Frost and Monica Rappacinni, before rejoining Dr. Fump at the main console. “It’s time to get paid” Dr. Cruler announces as Dr. Fump activated the machine and it started pumping the red liquid while supercharging it and infusing into the captives. They all started screaming and grunting in pain while the two evil scientists were laughing ang singing. “Bibamin~ cricketing in the barman~ bibaman~ cricketing in the barman~ bibaman~ cricketing in the barman~ bibaman~ cricketing in the barman~” Dr. Cruler sang enjoying the show with his partner. “Wait a minute Dr. Cruler!!” Dr. Fump halts the scientist.“We’ve forgot to wet the SPONGE!” he exclaimed as they stood silent for several seconds before they both laughed and Dr. Cruler continued singing. “Bibamin~ cricketing in the barman~ Bibamin~ cricketing in the barman~.”Suddenly the roof window shattered as a certain web slinging hero burst through and landed on the railing. “Wait… this isn’t the MegaSplash water park?” Spider-man joked. “Spider-man? Here but how-” Dr. Fump says. “Homing device on Spider-gwen” he says making them facepalm. “Knew we should have searched them” Dr. Cruler groaned. “Just get the Alpha Serum and let’s go!” Dr. Fump said. The other scientist grabbed a vial of blue liquid and two ran to their aircraft. The webslinger shoots a web and swings kicking into Dr. Cruler make him drop the vial breaking it and splashing its contents onto the hero. “Bleeuughh!! Thanks for the cologne, but I’d prefer scented soap” Spiderman says. “Damn it!  that was the only one we had” Dr. Cruler said as they reached their escape craft. “Time to cut losses then” Dr. Fump said as he pressed a red button creating explosions all over the facility. The two then got into the pod and flew off leaving the females still being injected. “Quick Spider-lad while I go after the scientists you free the captives. Wait… I don’t have a Spider-lad; (sigh) guess I’ll have to do everything as usual” he said as he swung to the main console and pressed the deactivation button along with the release switch. Soon the ladies were able relax after the process stopped and were free from the restraints. The heroines took a minute pull themselves together; the villainesses however had other ideas. “See ya bitches” Giganta yells as she grows and busted through the wall escaping giving the other evil-doers an escape point. “Come on” Knockout says grabbing Cassandra’s wrist and dragging her through the giant woman shaped hole. “Later losers” Livewire dashed out while Electro followed her; interested in he
