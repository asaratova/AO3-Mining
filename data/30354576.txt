Chapter 1: Prologue from Zero
    




Chapter Text
 Raging flames. Collapsed buildings.Raging flames. Plane wreckages.
 I know what it’s like to lose. 
The pain. Awakened was a great power.The pain. Born was a great power.
 Dread it. 
Shots. Then feeling life to death.Shots. Then seeing life to death.
 Run from it. 
“We don’t trade lives.”“Spare his life.”
 Destiny arrives all the same. 
“It’s all right.”“You’re all right.” Perfectly balanced.“Now is no time at all.”“There was no other way.”
 As all things should be. 
“You took everything from me.”“We won. You did it.”
 You couldn’t live with your own failure. 
“If you won’t let us go, just let us die.”“If you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive.” 
Where did that bring you? 
 “And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.”“Spider-Man’s name is Peter Parker!”
 Back to me. 
“At what cost?”“Everything.”
 The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
