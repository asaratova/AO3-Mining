Chapter Text
Darcy decided the whole thing was a terrible idea the very moment Natasha suggested it.  In fact, if it hadn’t been for the glorious cup of steaming espresso which had just arrived in front of her, she might have found something else that needed her immediate attention and left.  But the espresso was there, and it was glorious.  Plus Nat was paying.  So...she stayed.
“Let me get this straight,” she said, fingers drumming the table next to the tiny cup of caffeinated perfection.  “You want me to come along with you, Steve, and HYDRA’s least social ex-assassin, on a road trip to the Gulf of Mexico?”
Natasha glanced at her over the rim of her own cup.  “Yes.”
There was only one intelligent thing to say to that, so Darcy said it.  “Um, why?”
“Steve thinks it would be good for Bucky to finish his recovery beyond the bounds of SHIELD, and have a chance to acclimate himself to the outside world without feeling like his every move is being monitored.”  She paused a moment, tilted her head, and said, “I do too.  He needs a break from everything.  I think we all do.”
“Okay, that I get.  If a formerly brainwashed ex-assassin needs a break, a formerly brainwashed ex-assassin should have one, probably for the safety of all.  I'm more concerned with the part where you think I should come along for the ride.”
“I would have thought that was self-explanatory.  You and Steve are friends, you and I are friends…”
“Because you are terrifying, and I don’t want to die,” Darcy interjected.  “Also, you talked Steve into letting me have the good office with the window, which I’m still very grateful for by the way.”
“Terrifying, huh?”  Natasha rolled her eyes.  “Yeah, you seemed really terrified when you barged into my place uninvited the other night demanding sugar.”
“First off,” Darcy said, raising a finger, “I was having a cupcake crisis.  It was an honest to God, Defcon One batter emergency that required drastic action.  And second of all, I had no idea you and Steve would be having tantric super sex or whatever up against the refrigerator.  People who are getting busy up against a refrigerator should probably lock the door, which you had completely failed to do.  For the record, I had no idea you and Steve were having sex at all.  So that was hardly my fault.  And third of all...”
“There’s a third of all?”
“There most certainly is.  Third of all, yes I am still terrified of you, because you managed to get me sugar, threaten my life, and kick me out all in the space of three seconds while you were still tantric-ing it up with Steve.  I didn’t know whether to be completely impressed by your prowess, or to start making final arrangements in case you showed up later to ensure there were no witnesses to your kitchen hook-up.”
“Which did you decide?” Natasha asked, cup poised halfway to her mouth.
“Both.  I now own a very nice burial plot just outside of Syracuse.  Did you know that Friday can notarize wills?  It’s pretty damn convenient.  I left you my cupcake tins.”
“I don’t bake.”
Darcy shrugged.  “I’ll teach you in exchange for me not needing to use the plot anytime soon.”
“I’ll consider it,” Nat said.  
“Super.  Now, about this road trip,” Darcy began.
“The one that you are coming on as a personal favor to me?”
“The one that I am definitely not going on, since you and Steve are insane, and this is the worst idea ever,” Darcy told her.  “But mostly because, in case you haven’t noticed, Bucky hates me.”
“He doesn’t hate you,” Natasha said.  
“Um.  Yes.  He does.  Last week I offered to share my popcorn with him during movie night, and he got up and left the room.  As in, sharing popcorn with me was so offensive to him that he vacated the entire media area just to avoid it.”
“Maybe he doesn’t like popcorn,” Natasha countered with a nonchalant shift of her shoulders.
“Or,” Darcy responded, “and let’s just think about this for a second, because I really think it makes sense: he hates me.”
“Stop making this weird,” Nat said.  “Just say you’ll go so we have a fourth.”
“Are you serious right now?  You’re the one who wants to confine everyone’s favorite angry, knife-wielding hermit in close quarters with someone who has won the title of SHIELD's Most Non-Existent Filter two years running, on a drive down the coast from New York to Louisiana.  And you think I’m the one making it weird?  Natasha, this is a disaster waiting to happen.  One of us will end up dead, and fyi?  It will be me.  In a ditch.  Probably somewhere in Roanoke, Virginia.”
“I don’t think we plan on driving through Roanoke,” Nat said calmly.  “And I think Tony has you beat right now on the whole
