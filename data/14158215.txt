Chapter 1: Return
    


Notes:
My OCs exist simply to provide information and, in one case, transport.This idea just came to me. I'll see how many people work out what Howard intends to use before he actually does. ;)




Chapter Text
Howard Stark felt a dull throbbing in his face.For a moment, he didn’t remember what happened. Then it hit him like a truck. The crash...the pain...crawling from the car...then that face...Howard jerked up with a gasp. For a moment, his head swum. Then his vision righted itself. He found himself sitting up in a bed, in an unfamilar room. His wife lay next to him. He wondered if it was just a dream...if he’d just had a nightmare of Bucky Barnes forcing their car to crash and then murdering them....Then he saw the bruises on Maria’s neck.Leaning down, Howard checked his wife was still breathing. She was, to his relief. Howard studied the bruising and then slowly lifted his hand. He laid his hand over the bruises. That’s a handprint. The bastard had wrapped his hand around her throat and strangled her to death while she was stuck helpless in that car.And he hadn’t been able to do a damn thing about it.Howard slid his arm around his wife’s waist and buried his face into her shoulder. His mind turned over what could have possibly happened. His mind briefly flashed back to his son, slouched and pouting and safe. He hadn’t been with them and that was the one thing Howard was grateful for.He’d just about calmed himself down when Maria woke with a startled gasp. Her hands clamped to him.‘It’s all right,’ he whispered. ‘It’s over.’‘What happened, Howard?’ she whispered. ‘How...?’‘I don’t know.’ He pulled back and looked down at her. Her eyes immediately focused on the centre of his face. Howard remembered the metal fist slamming into his face. As there was bruising on her neck, there was sure to be bruising on his face. He pressed his lips together and rested his forehead against hers.‘What about Tony?’ she asked softly.‘He’s fine,’ Howard whispered. ‘He’s home.’Maria nodded.A knock on the door made Howard lean up and Maria turn her head. The door was opened and a white-haired woman walked in, followed by a young blond man who looked somewhere in his 20s. The woman walked with a cane which she didn’t seem to need at present. It took Howard longer than it should have to recognise her.‘Hazel Jones?’‘Well, it looks like he remembers you, grandma,’ the young man said, placing the tray he was carrying on the table in the room. ‘I’m gonna get back to work.’ He walked out.Hazel walked over and sat in the lone chair in the room. ‘It isn’t “Jones” anymore. I got married.’Howard leaned up. ‘How did we get away?’Hazel looked him right in the eye and said, ‘You didn’t.’Howard stared at her in disbelief. Maria’s grip tightened on his arms.‘We don’t understand how you’ve been resurrected, yet, but you did die that night – 24 years ago.’ The look on her face was one she’d worn expressly when Peg had done something to piss her off. ‘It was covered up as an accident caused by you, Howard, drunk driving.’Howard sat up completely now. ‘I was stone sober!’‘I know that,’ Hazel said. ‘And, now, so does Tony.’‘Tony?’ Maria asked.‘Yes,’ Hazel said. ‘He’s come a long way. From a moody child prodigy to arguably one of the most important people on the planet right now.’
Howard was startled at that. ‘You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that’s true, you’re gonna be a great man someday.’ ‘What do you mean?’Hazel chuckled. ‘We’ve got a portfolio downstairs.’ She gestured to the closet on the side of the room. ‘Once you’ve freshened up a bit, you can come down and I’ll explain.’ She nodded to the tray her grandson had left. ‘There’s coffee if you want some.’ That said, Hazel walked out of the room.Howard sighed and climbed out of the bed. He went for the coffee while Maria got up and opened the  closet. Neither of them said anything. Howard had known Tony would do great things one day – with a brain like that, how could he not? – but he also knew Hazel. The way she said that, it was like there was something...more.He’d met Hazel in the second World War. She’d been the bastard child of one of the colonels who worked out of the SSR base. Her mother had been nowhere in sight so she’d lived there like the rest of them. After the war, they’d met up again because her father had gotten her a job as a cleaner in a New York museum and she’d frequented the same diner that Peg did.Hazel had easily explained away her “unbecoming” behaviour with the simple statement of fact: I’m a bastard. Turned out some people expected bastards to be uncivilised and, if they were female, unladylike. It wasn’t fair, but very few perceptions of that era were. When she’d left, in ’49, Peg had tried to convince her to stay. Hazel’s response?
‘You have your battles to fight, and I have mine.’
There were only a handful of people – mostly from that time – who’d known who Hazel Jones was.Howard had told Maria about her before they’d
