  The first time they met him, they thought he was just another weird fan.Thor had just returned to Asgard, but the rest of the Avengers team was there when the blonde teen walked up to Steve and started to shake his hands violently. It was an aftermath of another alien invasion, this time involving elephant-aliens with purple trunk (Tony still didn't want to think too much about it), and they figured he was just another grateful, over-excited civilian.The teen rambled on as he shook Steve's hands, his words jumbling up until they almost made no sense (Tony even heard "I'm so proud of you" once, and that was only one of the many odd word choices), his blue eyes almost sparkled behind his glasses, and he looked like he was going to burst from sheer excitement.Tony could imagine Coulson's eyes narrow at the teen with jealousy and laughed at the image.Steve—the good, exemplary national icon that he was—simply put up his best smile, and before they could think too much about him, the teen was gone. A few minutes later the evacuation team came to pick them up and Clint started whining at Coulson because he was hungry, and hey, Tony was hungry, too; the conversation immediately devolved into whines and complains, and nobody bothered to bring up the teen.It wasn't like they were going to see him again, anyway.

Except they did see him again. Or at least, Tony did, this time.The second time they met him, it was during one of the PR events of the Avengers, and they were answering questions from the press when Tony spotted the teen among the crowd.Correction; Tony spotted the teen's hair among the crowd. It wasn't exactly easy to forget, after all. Now that he thought about it, the teen had a very peculiar hairstyle, one strand of hair stubbornly standing up as if it defied gravity. Tony tapped his chin at that. Did it? That particular strand stood really upright; was it actually physically possible? Tony started making some mental calculations, estimating the dimension and thus the weight of the strands, and the amount of gel it was needed to keep it upright like that—"—and that is why it was done. Right, Tony?" He suddenly heard Steve say.Steve's voice derailed Tony's train of thoughts. Tony immediately snapped his head up, only to see all pairs of eyes on him. Well, nothing to panic about. This wasn't the first time Tony zoned out during an important event, and definitely wasn't the first time he had to think on his feet.Tony remembered hearing about "Hydra" and "research facilities" not long ago, and the words reminded him of their discussion they had with Fury and Hill beforehand, something about the public's privacy with regards to the Stark Tech used to locate Hydra's hidden research facilities.Bingo. "Rest assured, citizens of America," he said, leaning forward to emphasize his point, "the Stark Industries understands the high regard the public puts on privacy, and we will always put yours before…"As he continued on, the teen disappeared from the crowd.

Tony learned his name during their third encounter.It was an aftermath of yet another attack from yet another super villain, this time in the form of a gigantic humanoid robot, courtesy of yours truly Doctor Doom. Bruce was attending a science convention in Phuket, Clint was on a mission in god-knows-where, and Thor still wasn't back from Asgard, so there were only the three of them.The familiar teen approached them with his ever-present excitement as the SHIELD agents were collecting the remains of the robot for further research, and he was talking animatedly to another teen with white hair and—Tony did a double take—a scarf, despite the fact that temperature hovered in the nineties."—see, I told you, Ivan!" Tony heard once they were within his earshot, "their awesomeness just totally owns yourheroes!"The one being called Ivan turned to them, but it was obvious that he wasn't looking at Tony. At first he thought they were looking at Steve, but as his eyes followed his gaze, he realized Ivan was looking at Natasha.Natasha noticed this, too. She raised her eyebrow, tilted her head slightly to the side and said, "any problems, gentlemen?"Ivan was practically beaming. "Nyet, Alfred," he said, and Natasha visibly tensed at the Russian word and accent, "not all of them are yours."The teen—Alfred—pouted. "Citizenship."Ivan hummed. "Ancestry.""She's fighting for America.""She's fighting for the world," Ivan said, "last time I remember, they were the Earth's Mightiest Heroes, not America's."It was weird, really, the way they talked about Natasha (and the Avengers, to an extent) as if they weren't there. Tony was quite used to being treated this way, having Pepper talk about him with their clients like he wasn't there, but Natasha was obviously insulted, and before Steve or Tony could stop her, she strode towards the two teens at record speed and swung her leg—Tony's eyes widened in surprise.Alfred ducked, and Ivan stepped slightly to his side,
