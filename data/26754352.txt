Chapter Text

“Peter! Are you ready?”


“Yeah, yeah. I’m coming!” Peter eyes himself in the large bathroom mirror one more time and smirks. He runs over to his boyfriend, nearly tripping over his feet as he enters their cozy bedroom. Tony has already finished setting up the camera, and he sits on the edge of the bed. Tony growls when he sees Peter all dressed up and he pats his lap.


“Mmmmh- C’mere baby,” Tony whispers gently. Peter doesn’t waste a second. He straddles Tony’s muscular thighs.


“Hi Daddy,” Peter whispers and presses a chaste kiss on Tony’s forehead. He always loves this. Loves the quiet, intimate moments they share right before they go live. He leans back slightly and innocently flutters his thick, black eyelashes.


“What do you think?” Peter tilts his head playfully, causing Tony to snort. The boy doesn’t miss the loving sparkle in the other’s eyes, though.

“You look stunning, Pete.” Tony’s breathy voice betrays the hint of arousal that fuels them both. “You could be in one of those pretentious mascara commercials,” the man jokes and drags Peter in even closer. His fingers creep up underneath the pastel pink sweater. Peter moans softly where the fingertips set off a series of sparks.


“They ain’t ready for a pretty boy like me.”


“Such a shame. You’d be even more famous then. Guess we have to make do with our loyal viewers then, don’t we?”


“Mmmh, they love me. Can’t keep their eyes off me,” Peter giggles and shrieks in surprise when Tony grabs Peter’s hips and pushes him down onto the mattress. Tony pins down Peter’s wrists above his head and smirks mischievously at Peter’s helpless groan.


“You’re irresistible, can’t wait- Imma make that mascara stain your cheeks. And all they can do is watch as you fall apart.” Tony crashes his lips down on Peter’s and kisses him passionately. 

It’s five minutes later when Tony realizes he forgot to turn on the cameras. Peter simply laughs and draws him back in.

“We’ll record it tonight, I need you now, Daddy.”


“Fuck, baby, you’ll ruin me.”
