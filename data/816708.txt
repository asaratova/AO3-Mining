...STARK INDUSTRIES CHAIRMAN, CEO ANNOUNCE $2.5bn RELIEF PACKAGE FOR NYC
Stark, Potts Lead the Way for Philanthropists Following Manhattan Devastation

By KATHERINE KIERNAN
...NEW YORK -- Stark Industries CEO Virginia Potts anounced today that the Fortune 500 company will be donating $1.5 billion towards disaster relief in the wake of the interspecies battle that leveled much of Midtown Manhattan. In addition to the sum ofered by the company, former CEO and curent chairman, Tony Stark, will be boosting the generous offering by a further $1bn. This extra aid will come from both his personal fortune, and from The Maria Stark Foundation, a charity founded by his mother in 1971.Many detractors have lambasted the man also known as Iron Man for his role in the destruction of the area largely destroyed during the attempted invasion. Ms Potts formally rejected any claims that Iron Man and Stark Industries were to blame for the event, and instead praised the actions of the team now known as The Avengers, a sentiment shared by New York emergecy service providers.Along with the monetary donation, Stark Industries and its subsidiaries will be providing staff to help plan, design, and implement new structures and infrastructure. Ms Potts expressed a desire to liaise closely with City Hall, to repair and restore the destroyed and damaged buildings in a way that is sympathetic to the original design.At the centre of the infrastructure work will be the newly completed, and still structurally sound, Stark Tower. The first skyscraper to boast it’s own ‘off the grid’ energy source, the arc reactor powered monolith will direct unused energy back into the grid, to help ease the heavy load the rebuild will put on the city’s power networkAppearing subdued, Mr Stark spoke of the intent for The Avengers to continue working as a team to help protect the city from threats like the one so many lost their lives to earlier this month. In a rare show of humility, the normally brash and arrogant former CEO thanked the city for the support and kindness it has offered the team. Unlike Ms Potts, Stark did not address those who do not support or admire the so called ‘superheroes’ other than a flippant remark disparaging their morality.Stark also informed the press that the rebuild would have at least one extra pair of hands, in the form of Captain America. The symbol of American patriotism will be helping to clean the streets and remove rubble, along with the Iron Man.The estimated cost of the invasion has been assessed at $160 billion, although that figure does not include the rumoured damage to classified government property. Following the announcement by Stark Industries this afternoon, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is reported to be gearing up to also donate a large sum. Other individuals and companies are bound to follow, as America’s business leaders focus on philanthropy over innovation for the forseeable future.
