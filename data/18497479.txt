Happy birthday buddy ! I can't believe that you are turning 18 . It feels like just yesterday since you came into this world screaming into my arms.Everyday I thank God for blessing me with a precious human being that Im proud to call my son. You maybe an adult to the whole world, but you will always be my piccolo.                                                                                                           replied to @IamIronMan

God, from the moment your father placed you in my arms , you snuggled right into my heart. How many years ago has been since you called me mom ? I may not be the one who give birth to you baby , but you will always be my precious sunshine. You grown up so fast , and I sometimes hate it . Happy birthday baby boy. I love you so much you cant even measure it.                                                  replied to @Potts-Stark
