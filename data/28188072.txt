Chapter 1: Rules!
    




Chapter Text
Hello! This is officially my very first yandere blog so first off, I'd like to give out some warnings: This full of yandere stuff of course, so there will be sensitive subjects and not safe for work stuff on here (that will be noted and warned accordingly) so I'd advise to look away from here if this sort of stuff is not your cup of tea or you're under 18. Especially when it comes to the more dark themes.
Also, please do not interact with this if you're under 18. I would just feel uncomfortable if minors read these writings,,, if. Please don't take offense to that, but it is for everyone's own good. 
Another important note is that I do not condone to any of the behaviors or actions presented in the imagines and such. Again, if you're uncomfortable with this, please scroll by or check out my non yandere fandom imagines blog on tumblr: @ofloveandstardustWith that said, here are the general rules:6-7 characters is my character limit; more characters means it'll take more time to write out.
Please let it be known that every character I write for is/will be 18+ or aged up to 18+!
N//SFW is allowed, but I'll be better at writing them out as headcanons than scenarios so please keep that in mind. I'll definitely get better writing them for scenarios over time.Anything is allowed for the most part (such as noncon, dubcon, and other stuff), but it's still advised to ask just in case I'm uncomfortable with writing a certain things, but kinks are a okay.One thing I know for sure is that I will not accept anything involving bodily fluids such as p*ss, sc*t, or v*mit. Blood is okay, but just ask to make sure.The darling will be gender neutral unless stated otherwise.  However, I will be a little more comfortable writing for a female darling in n//sfw situations, but I'll probably change that,,, maybe, I'm not sure. Until then, the reader will strictly be gender neutral or female in n//sfw situations.I am alright with doing more fluffier requests. Feel free to ask for anything fluffy!Please specify if you want hcs or a scenario for your request. A scenario for me is basically a paragraph or some more with some dialogue, kind of like a reaction of some sorts? But still, if the request does not state what they want, then I will write it out however. Please be a bit specific with what you're requesting so I can have something to go with. I feel more comfortable with this instead of just trying to figure out what someone wants from a vague request. But of course, there's a limit to that as well. Very specific darlings are a little iffy for requests because I do want to be inclusive of others.I will not accept p*dophilia. That is basically my limit and I will not write this sort of stuff, but there are other things I am willing to write. Just make sure to ask. If you are unsure about certain things, just ask. ^^Everyone is presented as 18+ in all these scenarios but with n//sfw situations, there are certain characters I will not write for in those situations (just ask if you're unsure but an example is Himiko and Hiyoko from Danganronpa but I will write other stuff for them, just not this). Other than that, EVERYONE IS 18+ AND/OR AGED UP TO 18+. 
 If you have any questions, feel free to ask! There's no judgement to wanting to ask a question if you're unsure of something.
