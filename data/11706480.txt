Chapter 1: Two Ladies and a Ladies Man

In the African wilderness a man with dark skin looked at the night skies with a smile taking in the sight of the stars. 'Mother, you have outdone yourself', he thought to himself. Just then two people approached him, a man with a long white beard and a redhead woman. The man turned to them with a smile while they for some reason scoffed slightly at him."Zues, Hera"."Anansi", Hera said."I take it that it was getting boring on Olympus, huh?" Anansi joked."Can we be serious for a minute?" Zues asked with slight annoyance."Fine, fine", Anansi said before gaining a serious face. "Do you have the rings?""Yes we do", Hera said pulling out a bag of rings. "We had to go and ask the Star Sapphires to infuse the emotion of love into them. I still don't get how your so called champion is to face off against them with love"."Oh Hera, always so cynical. You still can't see that even in a world filled with so much hatred, love can still be found", Anansi said before taking the bag and pulling out a ring."They are already here in our universe Anansi. Will this foolish plan of yours even work?'""Of course it will", Anansi said."And why is that?" Zeus asked before Hera could.Anansi smiled as he held up a ring. "Because in the end, the only way to save the world is with love".
Manhattan, New York
Peter Parker aka Spider-Man flipped and swung though the air as he was racing towards a burning building. Peter swung over to the side and by shifting his weight he catapulted himself into the building. Peter landed and ran through the burning building looking for anyone inside."Hello, is anyone there?!" Peter called out."Over here!" A voice called back. Peter ran over to see and elderly man trapped under debris. "I can't get up"."Don't worry, I'll get you out", Peter said before he grabbed the debris and lifted it off the man. He then proceeded to carry the man to the exit."Wait there is still someone here", the man said."Who else is here?" Peter asked."A little girl named Lisa" the man answered."Let me get you off here first then I'll get the girl", Peter said before getting the man outside the building. The moment he was outside the paramedics came by to check on him. Peter on the other hand swung up and back into the building. He worked his way up onto the upper levels and found the young girl unconscious. "Don't worry sweetheart I got you".Peter was able to get the girl and make it outside so the girl could get some medical attention. The moment he got down a woman ran up to him."Oh my god, Lisa!" The woman checked to see if her daughter was alright and confirmed it before turning to Peter. "God bless you Spider-Man". The woman was in tears, holding her still alive daughter, thankful that Peter saved her daughter. E police that came to see him...not so much."Hold it right there Spider-Man, you're under arrest", the officer said."Really now? I just saved a girl from a burning building and I'm still a menace?" Peter said."Well you could've started his fire","Why would I start a fire to a random building with families? You know what don't answer that because it will probably be the wrong answer", Peter said. "Besides I better get going"."Oh no you don't!" the officer said trying to grab him forcefully. Peter moved out of the way avoiding contact."Look as much as I want to talk about how wrong JJJ is, I have to go besides its really important", Peter said backing up before turning around and running the other way. "But hey we'll talk later, bye". And just like that Spider-Man swung off.

A being stands with his siblings watching as Spider-Man saves the lives of other people. They all have a smile of hunger on their faces."This is the totem that has defeated you before?""Yes, he is. Do not underestimate him, he is far stronger than he looks"."He still looks tasty to me"."Of course you do"."So what do we do for now brother? I'm pretty sure that he would not want the Spider to succeed"."Exactly, which is why Morlun, you will descend upon this Earth again to capture the totem"."Understood", Morlun said as he walked over to a device teleported to that Earth.
