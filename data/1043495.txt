Work Text:
It happened so slowly that it took Phil by surprise, which was to be expected, because Clint, showing an unusual amount of tact, hadn’t even mentioned the whole soulmate thing since Phil first got his wings.It started with Clint’s how to live with wings lessons, and progressed to flying lessons, and then coffee, and eventually dinner, until the two of them were spending nearly every moment of the day with each other.Clint had become such a permanent fixture in his life, that it took his absence (He and Natasha were assigned to a mission in Buenos Aires, and Fury, in a fit of monumental assholery, decided that someone else could take over the handling, because Coulson was need to oversee the training of some new Junior agents, a decision which Coulson wouldn’t let him forget any time soon) to make Phil realize that he might actually love the cocky little shit, an epiphany that had him sliding down the the nearest wall and muttering “Well, I’m fucked”.
