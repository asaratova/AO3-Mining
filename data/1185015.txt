Chapter Text
yeet. this is so cringe. im looking at this in 2019 considering re-writing but.... safe yourself from the cringe and just follow my tumblr instead. i warned you.“You’re nothing.”“Tony. You’re everything to me.”“You ungreatful little shi-““You amazing, beautiful, sm-““Nobody will ever love you.”“Tony, I love you.”“Expendable.”“Unwanted.”“Idiotic.”Tony fell to the ground in agony. “He knows. He knows. He knows everything.” He heard people screaming his name. His friends. His family. His… Steve. But no matter how hard he tried He couldn’t answer. He could only dig his nails into the cement ground and listen and watch the horrific life that he lived. Howard was right. Howard was always right.“Expendable.”“Unwanted.”“Idiotic.”******************************************************Tony was nervous. He bounced on his toes skittishly and twiddled his thumbs. Agent Phil Coulson, the official handler for the Avengers Initiative, gave him a judgmental glance before sending him a sympathetic nod. That wasn’t helping Tony’s nervousness.Tony sent Agent Coulson another look, pleading. When Phil didn’t respond, Tony finally broke, “How are you not freaking out, man?! We’re about to meet The Bruce Banner, the Black Widow, the Hawkeye, and holy moley, Phil, we’re going to meet THE Captain America!” Tony was basically screaming by then, finally succumbing to his excitement and nerves that had been eating away at him all day.Phil coughed awkwardly and nodded his head behind Tony. Tony blanched. No. No way, there is no way that the cliché “they’re-right-behind-you-and-oh-that’s-embarrassing” thing is happening when he meets his idols. He slowly turns and comes face to face- well, face to chest because goddamn it, Tony’s short- with Captain America.Captain. Freaking. America.Tony’s eyes widened and he backed up, so far that he would’ve run into Phil if he hadn’t pushed Tony away. “Oh- I- uh… geez, sorry- I um, well... Hey, Mr.- um, Sir?” Tony stuttered awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. He stuck out his hand, “I’m Tony Stark.”Now, Steve had heard a lot about this Tony Stark. He was Howard’s kid, after all. Apparently, he was a genius, even at his young age of nineteen. He owned Howard’s company, SI, now that Howard was… dead. A pang went through his heart. Learning that all of his friends were dead and that the world still needed him to be strong and help save the world was a lot to take in, and his head was still spinning. Bucky, Peggy, Howard, everyone. All gone.Steve blinks and remembers the nervous kid in front of him, staring at him like he’s a dream come true. Steve smiles, he had been back in… well, back in the land of the living, for about 2 months now, and this kid that he had never met was the first one to smile at him so genuinely. Not to mention all the blushing and stuttering, which wasn’t anything less than flattering. “It’s so nice to meet you, Tony. No need for formalities, you can just call me Steve.” He said, returning Tony’s handshake.Tony looked like he was going to pass out. Hell, Tony felt like he was going to pass out. Did Captain America just tell him that he could call him Steve? Is that what happened? Is Tony still alive? Tony was about to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming when another face entered the large conference room.“Sorry, sorry, I got a little held up at the airport.” Bruce Banner said, placing some papers in front of Coulson.Yeah, Tony was positive this was a dream now.“Not a problem Dr. Banner.” Phil reassured him, shaking his hand. “Dr. Banner, this is Tony Stark, our-““Fundamental supervisor, and our own personal genius, I’ve heard.” Bruce gave the blushing kid a smile.Tony’s jaw dropped, “Wh- me? But- I, what? No, no. You’re the genius, I mean, dude, your work on gamma radiation?! And- not to mention the whole green rage monster thing, which is totally aweso-““Tony. Calm.” Phil chastised.“Too late” Tony said, sitting down slowly.Bruce, on the other hand was astonished. No one had ever complimented the Hulk, before. Not that Bruce though he deserved any, but still, the compliment was more than gratifying. “Thank you, Mr. Stark.”Tony looked a Bruce for a second before smiling widely, looking like he was trying not to laugh. “You, sir, can call me Tony.”“Tony, then, call me Bruce.”The arrival of Clint Barton and Natasha Romanov went more smoothly, at least in Tony’s case. Well, yes, he gushed over how cool it was that Natasha took down a base of 250 Middle Eastern terrorists all by herself, and yes, he nearly died when Clint told him that he’d teach him how to shoot arrows, but he didn’t ramble or stutter. At least not that much.Nick Fury had never particularly hated Tony Stark. Of course, the kid was hyper and kind of annoying, but knowing him since he was 6, Nick knew that this Tony was a lot better than the Tony he knew 3 years ago. Sure, Tony was still a little shy, shouting made him uneasy, and authority figures were something
