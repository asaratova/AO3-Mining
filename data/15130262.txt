Chapter 1: Peter Throws Shade
    




Chapter Text
Tony doesn’t often get calls from Peter Parker. Even though Peter has his number, it’s an “emergencies only” type of situation; he still gives his general updates to Happy. Tony’s usually the one to reach out to Peter, either to try and convince himself he’s being a half decent vigilante babysitter or to invite the kid up to the labs. So when he gets a call from Peter at 2:43 in the morning on a Friday night, he’s hit with a wave of panic.Pepper looks up sleepily from beside him as he snatches up his phone and swings his legs out of bed. She rolls her eyes and blows him a kiss before settling back down into the pillows. Tony barely sees her, he’s so busy trying to get his shaking hands to answer the phone.“How dead are you?” he asks as a way of greeting, trying to keep the panic in his voice to a subtle undertone.“Ohmigod, so dead,” Peter says, sounding just as riled up as Tony feels.Tony is out of bed in an instant, the suit half on as he stumbles on to the balcony. “I’m on my way, just hold on, how badly are you—,”“What? No!” says Peter. “I’m not actually dead, it’s an expression. I’m not even patrolling right now.”Tony stops, his leg halfway slung over the railing of his balcony. The suit is fully on, and his heart is beating ten miles a minute.“What.”“It’s something people say,” Peter says, sounding mildly abashed at the cold fury in Tony’s voice. “Like if you see a funny vine, or a viral video of adorable puppies sneezing, you say, ‘I’m so dead.’ You know.”Tony half falls back onto the deck, his suit dismantling around him. The panic in his brain is dulling. His heart is slowing down. Tony’s fairly sure when he looks in the mirror tomorrow, all his hair will be gray. This fucking kid.“If you’re not dead,” Tony says harshly, “Or in the middle of dying a gruesome, bloody death, why have you decided to grace me with your voice at three in the morning?”“I just saw the video!” Peter exclaims, his voice slightly panicked. “Ned sent it to me at eleven, but I didn’t get home until ten minutes ago so I couldn’t watch it, and—,”“Hang on,” Tony says, holding up a hand. “Pause. You were out patrolling until two thirty at night? Didn’t you’re aunt set a curfew?”“It’s negotiable,” Peter says. “She just doesn’t want me to go behind her back, I think. Anyway, Ned sent me this video—,”“I’m not really interested in the GIFs teenage boys send each other in the wee hours of morning,” Tony says grouchily, watching the suit fold back up into a portable sized square and shoving it in his pocket.“Dude, Falcon name dropped me in an interview,” Peter interrupts, his voice an octave higher than normal.Tony’s heart freezes for the second time in the last five minutes. “And by name dropped, you mean . . .”“Well, he namedropped Spiderman,” amends Peter. “But not in a cool, yeah, I met him once, kind of way. He said I was a little asshole.”“He’s not wrong,” Tony can’t resist saying.“Mr. Stark,” says Peter, his voice dangerously close to a whine. “Right, right, sorry,” says Tony, settling back into bed besides Pepper. She frowns at the phone and mouths: everything okay? Tony nods and waves her down. “What was the context?”“I guess some security footage was leaked of the fight in Germany,” Peter says. “Some of the footage showed me, like, webbing him and the dude with the badass metal arm to the ground. The interviewer was all like, looking back on it, do you think you could’ve taken him down if you had tried harder? And the falcon totally dissed me, said he was pulling his punches, and called me a little asshole.”“Well,” says Tony mildly, putting Peter on speaker so he can page through Youtube to find the video. “In his defense, I’m sure the footage didn’t make him look to great. He got taken down by someone whose resume mainly included getting cats out of trees.” Tony realizes after he says it how much pride leaked into his voice, and he resolves to be extra distant for the rest of the phone call.“Hey, you’d be surprised by how hard it is to deal with cats that don’t want to be saved,” Peter says indignantly.“I’m going to stop you right there, kid,” Tony says, stifling a yawn behind his hand. “Why do you care what Sam told some interviewer from god-knows-where he’s hiding out? No one cares what he thinks.”Peter hesitates. “Never mind. You’re right, it’s stupid,” he says finally.Great. Now Tony feels like an asshole. He takes a deep breath and reminds himself that Peter isn’t used to having negative press. Most of the local newspapers in New York love him; hell, he gets more good PR helping old ladies cross the street than Tony gets from denuclearizing part of North Korea. Everyone loves Peter Parker, but the first time an Avenger publically talks about him he gets called a little asshole? That’s bullshit. Sam is going down.“It’s not stupid,” Tony says. “If it pisses you off, do something about it.”“Like what?”“I don’t know,” Tony says breezily. “Post the leaked footage of you kickin
