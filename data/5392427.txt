Chapter Text
Steve has finally managed to put Natasha on the mat, and he’s fairly proud of that; she’s awful slippery and he’s not great with this new chess-master hand-to-hand quasi-gymnastics stuff. He really prefers the old ‘hit them in the face until they don’t get back up again’ school of fighting, but Coulson has been adamant and Natasha has been more than game to lay him out flat on his ass twice a week, so he’s been keeping with it even if it does hurt his pride, and now he’s actually managed to put her down. He’s pleased with himself, even if he knows it’s only for a moment, and he braces up, because usually this is about the time when she decides to cold-cock him just for spite. He can take it, but that doesn’t mean he has to like it. There’s no keeping her in a hold, so he hardly even tries anymore, but he makes a token grab at her anyway, throwing himself off balance in the process. She just writhes out of his grip, all effortless balance and grace, and as she slides out from beneath him, her hip lightly grazes against his crotch. There’s a moment of perfect friction, and suddenly he’s all too aware of how Natasha smells, the way her chest rises as she breathes; his vision narrows like he’s just been blindsided. It’s only a moment before muscle memory kicks in, and already his body is trying to get him back on his feet. He focuses on the lingering ache in his knee from where she took him down hard earlier and tries to shake it off, but it’s like there’s no air in the room, and he’s not entirely sure which way is up. He ends up just sitting there, half-stunned and feeling stupid.  Natasha stretches, working a sore muscle in her arm, and grabs her water bottle, but when he doesn’t get up straight away, she drops back down beside him, “Are you alright?” She tilts her head back as she drinks, the tendon along the side of her throat in sharp relief against sweat-slick skin, and he can’t quite look away as she swallows. He looks away just as she catches him staring, tries to stare at the mat, but he just gets stuck on the flash of skin at her ankle, the zipper there left undone, silver split wide along the curve of her calf, pulled tight against her skin. “I, uh, yeah,” he hears himself, but he’s still caught in that zipper, the way it drags and catches as she shifts.  “Are you sure?”“I, um. Sorry,” he shakes himself out of it, “It’s not personal.” Natasha just stares at him blankly, and he realizes maybe that wasn’t actually the best thing to say. “I…” he coughs, clearing his throat, “It isn’t that I don’t find you attractive… I just…”Natasha lets him choke for a moment before she finally smirks, “It’s alright.” He manages some approximation of a laugh and grabs his towel, wipes the sweat from the back of his neck, playing for time, looking for a way to brush this off, so they can just pretend she caught him off guard, winded him, and go on beating the ever-loving hell out of one another like it’s just any other Thursday afternoon. Or, well, Natasha can go on beating the ever-loving hell out of him, and he can keep learning to dodge the hard way. He’s come to accept that. Natasha doesn’t say a word, and he’s intensely aware of how she’s watching him; even though he trusts her well enough, knows she’s on his side, he also knows she’s cataloguing every breath and twitch, reading him like an open book. The way she tilts her head and almost smiles, it would be comforting from anyone else, but from Natasha it just makes him feel like an insect under glass, and while it’s not an entirely novel sensation, what with all the poking and prodding the Army and now SHIELD has put him through, it’s still enough to make him wish he could just disappear, sink into the mat and never be seen again. He sighs, “Well, they did say it would enhance everything,” and here he manages a casual shrug, throws his towel over his shoulder, “I just didn’t think they meant, you know, everything.” He stares off into the distance, absently reading a note taped to the gym door, “It’s just hard to take the edge off, alone.” The sheen of her jumpsuit in the harsh gym lighting brings out all the strong lines of her body, and he can just see her out of the corner of his eye as she slides closer, putting a hand on his shoulder, “Easier to just be so tired, you don’t care,” and her voice is surprisingly kind. It’s harder than he thought it would be to actually admit it, but she knows every tell he has, and he just nods. It’s not dignified, talking about things like this with teammates, and he really wishes he were a bit more clever. All he wants to do is make some excuse and slink off to his bunk, hide until next week or next year. All that effort he put into studiously ignoring the supple curve of her waist, the sinuous lines of muscle as she stretches, that satisfied little h
