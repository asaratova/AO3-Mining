Azazel takes them away in a whoosh of hot air and smoke, and he deposits them by the side of the road in the middle of a desert, the dry land stretching scorched on all sides for as far as the eye can see.This is when Erik starts to run.**They collect Emma from the CIA facility a few days later. Erik spends the time between trying to purge himself, to create a leader of mutants who will be feared and respected and maybe, if he’s lucky, loved. He changes his name, his clothing, his demeanour. He refashions Shaw’s helmet into his own and keeps it firmly pressed against his skull, protecting him from anything that would stand in his way. It’s cold on his cheeks but that’s fine, because he needs to become cold to do what must be done.They collect Emma, and Erik continues to run.**They drive in a straight line, across the country and away from Westchester, and Emma has a distant look on her face as Riptide grips the wheel; after every ten or twenty miles, Erik looks at her expectantly, and she simply shakes her head. They keep going.It isn’t until they’re beyond Washington DC and halfway to Richmond that she lets out a breath, and nods, with a brittle smile on her face.They’re out of Charles’ range.**“He keeps looking for you, you know,” Emma says suddenly, in the dark of the bedroom, and Erik looks at her. “Pleading, asking you to come home. He says that he doesn’t blame you for what happened.”“And so he shouldn’t,” Erik snaps, and turns onto his back to stare up at the ceiling. There’s a patch of mould spreading from one corner; the furniture smells of old smoke. Tomorrow they’ll move on and leave this dirty motel behind, and they will sit in silence in the hot old car. To start with, it was uncomfortable to sleep with the helmet on, but he’s growing used to it – they may be out of range, but he’s not going to take any chances.“You did shoot him in the back and cripple him,” Emma points out, sitting up to look down at him, and he scowls beneath the helmet.“I would never intentionally hurt Charles,” he says stiffly. “If the human hadn’t made the idiotic decision to fire her gun at me, we would not be in this situation. If the men on those ships hadn’t fired upon us after we saved the lives of countless people, we would not be in this situation. No, it is the fault of humanity. Not mine.”“You can protest all you want, but I know that you still feel responsible,” she says flatly, and Erik sits up very suddenly, narrowing his eyes.“Are your powers getting through this helmet?”“I don’t need powers to see how much you hate yourself for what happened. But if you want, I can help ease your guilt.”She raises one hand to touch the very bottom of his helmet, as though to remove it, and in a split second he’s grabbed her wrist and yanked it backwards, twisting onto his knees and rising above her, pushing her away from him whilst holding on tightly.“Don’t you ever attempt to access my mind again,” he snarls violently, and she pulls at her wrist, but she’s not strong enough to break free from his grasp, and she glares at him mutinously, her eyes glinting.“You told me that you wanted me to fill the gaps that he left.”“But that is one gap that you will never be able to,” he says, and releases her with a push. She glares at him in the moonlight, her blonde hair gleaming, and Erik has never hated her quite as much as he does in that moment. He turns onto his side with his back to her, and closes his eyes.After a few moments, Emma stands from the bed and pulls on a robe, striding from the room and slamming the door behind her. He can feel the anger that she’s projecting at him, but he can’t bring himself to care.Tomorrow, he’ll run a little further.**Erik no longer has the sheer, indomitable power of Charles’ mind at his side, and he does not have Cerebro – but he has Emma to help him look for mutants, to scan areas as they pass through them. Mystique asks him after a few weeks where they’re going, and he doesn’t have an answer. He doesn’t have a direction yet, or a destination – he’s still running from the beach and the betrayed look in Charles’ eyes.**Emma locates one, finally, as they skirt around the edges of Toledo. He’s an illusionist, she says – a very strong mutant, one who can project sound and touch and smell and taste and sight all at once. He would be useful, she says, but there is one problem.They approach the prison where Jason Wyngarde is being kept with night at their backs, and it will be a simple extraction; everything is simpler with a teleporter and a metamorph. Erik pauses at the entrance and turns to Riptide, Emma and Angel.“You three need to stay here in case any extra guards decide to appear,” he instructs, and Emma takes a step forward, her eyes flickering over his face.“You should take your helmet off before you go in.”“For any particular reason?”“I need to be able to let you know if there are guards approaching,” she points out, and Erik thinks of his imaginary line over two hundred miles awa
