Chapter 1: Chapter 1 Fluff
    




Chapter Text
There was a lot of paperwork in running a country. Especially a country that was slowly opening it’s borders to outsiders. It was close to midnight and the king could hear his bed calling to him. All T’Challa wanted to do was rest, but he still had to read through this trade deal with the United Kingdom. With a deep sigh, he dropped the paper onto the table, missing the opening of the office door.“You should be in bed with me.”T’Challa chuckled, dropping his head back onto Everett’s chest, smiling tiredly up at his husband.“Trust me beloved, I am more than aware. But the Prime Minister waits for no man.”“Well, she can wait for you. I am not spending another night alone in our bed T’Challa.”T’Challa allowed himself to be pulled up and out of his office.Both men were more than aware that T’Challa could take Everett out with one hand, but they were also aware that the king loved his consort too much for that. T’Challa offered little resistance as he was stripped and tucked into bed, thoughts of treaties and trade deals running through his head. It wasn’t until Everett was lying alongside him, head resting over the king’s heart, that finally T’Challa’s mind fell silent. Here, listening to his sleeping husband breathing softly beside him, T’Challa could finally relax, ignoring all the problems in his day to day life. Deciding that tomorrow would bea day spent with his family and pulling Everett closer to him, pressing a kiss to his forehead, T’Challa slept.
