In the beginning, Bucky doesn’t trust Sam as far as he can throw him.To be fair, there aren’t many people that Bucky trusts at this point in time. He sort of trusts Steve, in that he obeys Steve’s suggestions like they’re orders and sticks close to him when they’re both in the house and occasionally even initiates conversation with him. He trusts Tony enough to let him do maintenance on his arm, and he doesn’t seem too worried about Bruce - once, back when they first brought him into the tower, he even let Bruce give him a full medical check-up without destroying a single item in his lab.But he doesn’t trust Sam. All it takes is for Sam to enter a room and Bucky tenses up, watching him with sharp eyes that are half predator and half frightened prey.“Don’t worry about it,” Sam tells Steve, shaking his head with that good-natured smile he has which is one of the reasons Steve feels so bad about Bucky’s attitude. “A guy like Barnes is bound to have some trust issues - there’s no rush to get him warmed up to me. He’s not doing any harm.”Which is true, although there are days when that fact doesn’t feel like much comfort to Steve. Bucky’s not doing any harm. He’s also not doing anything else, really. His favourite hobbies are staring into space from his sheltered spot in the corner of the living room, and staring into space from his lookout point on top of the Avengers Tower, and occasionally - when he’s feeling sociable - staring into space from a single-seater armchair in front of the TV while the others watch a movie together.Steve remembers a time when it would have been him sitting on the fringes of everything, watching Bucky laugh and crack jokes and forge lifelong friendships just by turning on his most charming smile and letting everyone flock to him.“He’ll come around to you,” Steve says, more confidently than he feels. Even if he weren’t such a people-person, the Bucky Steve knew would have loved Sam. Which means that, really, it’s all just a question of how much is left of the Bucky Steve knew inside the sullen, skittish man who moments ago just fled the living room like a startled gazelle because Sam walked into it.And there’s only one answer to that question which Steve can stand to think about.-Here’s the thing: Steve’s desires are irrelevant. That’s what he tells himself over and over, repeating it in his head like a mantra, because there are times when he needs the reminder so badly it makes him sick. There are times when Bucky comes out of the shower with his wet hair slicked back off his face and a towel slung low around his hips (he understands the theory of privacy, these days, but not always the practice). There are times when he smiles at Steve across the table, slow and stiff and unpracticed but just enough like his old smile that Steve’s heart lurches in his chest. There are times they never talk about the morning after, when Steve wakes to the sound of whimpering from Bucky’s room and sits by his side just stroking his forehead until he goes back to sleep.Sometimes, on those nights, Bucky’s hand shoots out when Steve tries to leave; sometimes it’s to grab for Steve’s throat, other times for his wrist. Once, he holds on for so long that Steve ends up falling asleep where he sits, and he wakes the next morning with a metal arm wrapped tight around his waist and Bucky’s face buried in the hollow of his throat and it’s almost - almost - like the world has gone back to the way it’s supposed to be.But Steve’s desires are irrelevant. It’s Bucky’s wellbeing that matters, and Steve’s job is to support the slow crawl of progress as Bucky claws his way out of the pit Hydra buried him in.Last century’s Bucky was brimming with life, and last month’s Bucky was an empty shell. Today’s Bucky has a soft, hoarse voice and eyes that dart around the room like a hunted animal. There are sparks appearing in his hollow stare again, little flashes of interest in the outside world that sometimes align with Steve’s expectations and sometimes don’t. He likes watching the baseball, and he also likes Tony’s weapons cache (there was a full-scale tower-wide meltdown on the day he bypassed security to get in there, but when Steve found him he wasn’t even arming himself - just inspecting a prototype grenade launcher with an expression of innocent curiosity on his face). Left to his own devices he drinks his coffee black and bitter and scalding hot like he always used to, but then there’s the day when Sam brings him back a frappucino from his post-mission Starbucks run and Bucky looks like he’s going to cry when he takes his first sip of it.“You should go back to that cold coffee place,” ends up being the first thing Bucky ever actually says to Sam. It’s also, incidentally, the first time Steve has heard him ask for anything beyond basic survival necessities.Steve marks it down as a triumph, and ignores the little pang inside him when Sam grins widely at Bucky and Bucky’s return smile has none of the stiffness
