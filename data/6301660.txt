Chapter 1: Punisher
    


Notes:
I'm just going to call Bucky Bucky from now on. It's just easier to write when switching POVs, which will happen quite a bit. The other guys still call him Nicolai sometimes.And also, this is the TV Matt Murdock, not the comic verse.




Chapter Text
Peter meets the infamous Punisher at Grandma Nelson's restaurant over a piece of peach pie. It’s an accident really. He likes Foggy, and he likes Foggy’s grandmother, but Grandma Nelson's cheesecake? Now that he loves. Peter is just dropping by for a piece of his guilty pleasure when he spots Daredevil sitting in a corner booth with someone other than Foggy or Karen. Matt's body language is relaxed, but a bit resigned when he slides a manila folder across the table. Peter ends his chat with Foggy at the bar and wanders over to say hello. Matt actually jumps, somehow so wrapped in his conversation with the mysterious stranger that he doesn't even notice Peter entering the restaurant. They both glance up at the young man, Matt with his mouth parted in an almost guilty 'O,’ and his friend scowling up at Peter as he hunched over a slice of Grandma Nelson's famous peach pie. Underneath the bulky leather jacket, Peter catches a flash of a bleached skull on the man's shirt. "Ah, Peter." Matt says awkwardly. "How are you?" "Great, just dropping by for food. Who's this guy?" Peter grins down at them as the man flips open the folder Matt had slid over to him. Murdock looks a little pained when he introduces, "this is Frank, Frank Castle. He's an...acquaintance. Frank, this is Peter Parker, the nice young man I told you about before. Peter, we're just about done, so-" "Wait, Frank Castle as in The Punisher Frank, or random civilian Frank?" Peter squints down at Matt's carefully expressionless face. Frank takes another casual bite of his pie and shakes a stack of photos out of a plastic evidence bag. Matt sighs, annoyed as he says, "can't you wait a few minutes before tearing into your present?" Frank ignores him and spreads the pictures. Peter glances down and feels his jaw drop. "You take photos of the thugs you kill as souvenirs?" Peter asks incredulously, "is that a picture of a severed hand under that pile of corpse shots?"Frank takes a sip of his tea before rolling his eyes. "No, the police took those, ya little idiot. I didn't kill these pieces of garbage. This is the aftermath of a Mexican cartel gang war. I got 'em off of Red here after he lost a game of poker to me." "I thought you said you guys weren't friends, Matt." Peter grins. "We're not." Daredevil says firmly. "Frank and I do not have the same ideals when it comes to keeping Hell's Kitchen safe." "Well, I get the job done, don't I? Not to mention, I saved your fucking ass a few times.""Yes, and every time bodies end up in the morgue when you're in a generous 'helping' mood." Peter drops down opposite the two bickering men, grinning. "Pshh, you're just mad you lost." "Gloating about winning a poker game against a blind man, Frank?” Matt cocks his head to the side, shades flashing in the afternoon sun."You just keep milking that disability thing, Murdock. Works wonders on the ladies, but you need to try harder with me." Frank drains his cup with a grimace, and slams the china down on the table, making Peter jump."Oh yeah? Why's that?" Matt raises his eyebrow, sipping calmly at his coffee. "Because I know you're not just some helpless disabled altar boy, Red. Gave me a fucking concussion the first time we crossed paths." He rubs a hand over his stubbled jaw at the memory. "Couldn't even tell you were blind as a bat when you punched me in the face." "Oh stop it, Castle. You're making me blush." "It's like watching an old married couple," Peter calls out to Foggy, laughing. "Tell me about it," Foggy grins, balancing three beers and an orange soda on a tray. He settles down at their table after ruffling Matt's hair with a fond hand. "Every Thursday afternoon. Never fails to show up, the both of them, always bickering like third-grade girls at the booth in the corner. Frank with his black tea and slice o’ peach pie, and Matty, sipping Gram’s crappy coffee like a prim and proper lady." "I like it better when your grandmother is runnin' this shit joint." Frank mutters, ignoring Foggy's attempt at a friendly bro fist bump. Matt laughs and grabs a beer. "Hey, you're a minor, kid. Grubby lil' paws off the booze." The Punisher slaps the back of Peter's hand when the teenager reaches for a beer without thinking. Foggy shoves the insultingly cheerful orange soda toward him. "Oh, come on! I'm 20!" Peter whines, rubbing at the sting and scowling at the three smug faces across the table from him. "Yeah, so basically a kid.” Matt says with an innocent smile, elbowing Frank in the side. Then he sighs and says sadly, “that seems to be the only thing we'll ever agree upon, Frank."Frank rolls his eyes and mutters, “drama queen.” “Jackass,” Matt returns sweetly without missing a beat. “Well, I’ve
