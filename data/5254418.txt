Chapter 1: A Day in The Life
    




Chapter Text
Entering the Stark-vengers Tower every morning is intimidating for even the most powerful men and women in the world. Even if Darcy was an exception to this rule, and she was, everyone has a part to play.So instead of wearing her comfiest sweater and rattiest jeans (that were 15 percent less fabric than most jeans), she had to be "smart business casual" or "casual business formal" (whatever that meant). Apparently, the twenty-something could hardly show up to work for a multi-billion dollar organization without showing at least a modicum of effort. Darcy's approximation of an adult wardrobe was a relatively conservative business casual skirt and red blouse.Her rebellious streak insisted that she still wore her knit hats, a frumpy charcoal cardigan to match the skirt, and hipsteriest glasses. To add an extra touch of “I am a competent 21st century woman, hear me roar”, Darcy came in with an Iced Venti Coconut-Milk Double Dirty Chai in her left fist, brandished like a taser meant to ward people out of her personal space. Morning people suck, she thought ungenerously, especially on Tuesday mornings.She quickened her pace, trying to avoid touching any of the corporate folk in fear of their cooties.Passing by the main reception area, she calls out a “Heya, Charlie,” putting all of her pre-caffeine energy into greeting the middle aged African American woman stationed at reception today. “How’s the whine and twine club?”Darcy found about this knitting social club when she asked about the rainbow patterned baby onesie that the older woman had created slowly over the course of a week. Darcy has been trying to get into the knitting circle ever since. It was comprised of nothing but administrative staff and some lower-middle management of Stark Tower. They had the best baked goods, and even better gossip. The evilest part of Darcy’s mind cackled quietly to itself at this knowledge.“Oh, Darcy-dear,” the woman drawled in her surprisingly deep voice, “You know you have to hit at least your one year anniversary and bribe us with something good to get in.” The woman hardly looked up from a morning crossword before delivering this well-worn admonishment.Darcy’s exaggerated huff only brought a smirk to the older woman’s face. “I’m going to be the first exception,” Darcy said shook her right fist at the woman, the effect ruined by the bright pink lanyard holding her staff ID wrapped around her small hand. She turned her body to maintain a line-of-sight while still shaking her fist, walking backward precariously but quickly on her matte red pumps, “Just you watch me!”The only response she got was a quick laugh and the swoosh of security gates opening up behind her just in time to prevent her from causing an accident. People swarmed into lines away from Darcy’s, in a well learned fear response that recognized that just because there was no accident, scene or other mayhem today did not mean that the petite brunette wouldn’t be causing something the next day.-The elevators that led up to the Avengers were not far out of the way from normal tower traffic. In that way, it lulled a lot of people into the false notion that the top most floors of the tower were easily accessible. Those people were stupidly wrong.Darcy, having worked here for close to six months, could tell that there were more sensors in the small strip of hallway than most G8 governments used in their respective major spy agencies. She could see the subtle glint of video cameras, carefully hidden in light fixtures and in corners of glass panes. And that’s all anybody like Darcy Lewis would see unless they had exceptional skills or training. Darcy saw more than most people would think.The elevator dinged open, revealing a sleek silver and wood interior. “Morning Jay-man,” she spoke sipping at the green straw. “How’s it hanging?” There was the barest hint of reluctance present about asking that question.“The usual, Ms. Lewis,” came a smooth voice from inside the elevator.If one were an outsider, one would assume that Jarvis’s greeting was rather abrupt. They might even assume that Darcy was being somewhat reserved towards the artificial intelligence. That was not the case at all.The first Monday of Darcy’s official status as a member of Team SCIENCE! (Formal title: Senior Research Administrator for Special Projects reporting directly to Pepper Potts), Darcy had walked into the Research and Development division excited and nervous about her first day. What she found was Jane, Bruce and Tony all nearly manic from sciencing for close to 40 hours straight. There were three explosions, a completely decimated snack cupboard, five lab assistants quitting at once, two sexual harassment complaints, an unstable wormhole, and one completed prototype of a genetically modified virus that would theoretically inoculate astronauts against most harmful space radiation. And that had been the first 45 minutes of her walking through the do
