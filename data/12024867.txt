Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“Excuse me, Ms.Potts,” came the voice of Pepper’s secretary from the intercom, “There is someone here from finance to see you. Should I let him in?”
“Yes, I'm just finishing up for the day, send him in.” replied Pepper as she placed the paperwork she was doing into a neat and straightened pile.
“I’m very sorry to disturb you, Miss. Potts, but there seems to be an issue with some of the payments.” came a hesitant greeting from the tall willowy man as he entered and approached her desk.
“If there are issues you should have gone to HR -” 
“They have to do with Mr.Stark’s salary from S.H.I.E.L.D. and the payments they had to make for the tech that they leased from us.” he quickly interrupted and held out the Stark Pad with the information on it.
Pepper quickly glanced through the transactions, then looked up to the man, “Thank you, Mr.”
“Thompson, Jack Thompson.” Jack supplied.
“Thank you Mr.Thompson, for coming to me with these, you can count on a bonus coming your way.” Pepper smiled softly, “Have a nice night.”
With that Pepper slipped the Stark Pad into her purse, gathered her things and walked briskly out of her office while wishing her secretary a good night. She headed to the car garage, and got into her car, as soon as her door shut she called on JARVIS, who had integrated himself into her car seemingly ages ago. 
“Yes Miss. Potts? What can I do for you?”
“JARVIS arrange a meeting for tomorrow with our lawyers as soon as you can. I will send a summary and documents regarding the charges I wish to press.”
“Very well Miss.Potts.” said JARVIS almost joyous tone, Pepper figured  that he had already scanned the Stark Pad in her purse and seen the documents. With that Pepper headed towards home. ____________________________________________________________________
Tony, Rhodey and Happy had spent the afternoon laying around the living area of the Malibu house, it was guy’s night - afternoon - so there was an six pack, now empty, and three empty boxes of pizza on the floor next to them. They had made sure that there were at least four slices of pizza in the kitchen, along with a beer reserved for Pepper. They were huddled around the coffee table, playing poker, when JARVIS announced that Pepper had pulled into the underground garage and was on her way up.
When Pepper finally entered the living area she let out an exasperated sigh at the greasy boxes on the expensive cream rug, but still offered a fond smile to the three men now standing up to greet her. After giving Rhodey and Happy a hug, and Tony a quick peck, she went to change out of her office clothes. 
“Tony,” she began as she walked into the room, now in sweatpants and one of tony’s t-shirts, “There is something you should see. JARVIS, if you could please pull up the files.”
A few seconds later the files showed up in front of Tony. After going through it, Rhodey said, “You should definitely sue them man, that’s nearly two million dollars, that they didn't pay you, not to mention that they didn’t even touch your consulting fees.”
“Yeah boss. But how did they hid this from you for so long? Don’t your payments pass through the S.I. servers before being deposited in your bank account?” Asked Happy.
“I may have an answer to that Mr.Hogan.” interrupted JARVIS, “I did some check ups, and it seems that when Agent Romanoff joined Stark Industries earlier this year she used a virus to enable S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians to hack and manipulate Stark Industries’ servers. Unfortunately, I was not aware of the problem as Sir had me focused on looking for cures for his problem. Rest assured, I have taken care of the problem now, and by 3:23 am new firewalls will be in place.”
“Thank you JARVIS.” said Pepper before turning to Tony, “ I called for a meeting with our lawyers, so be in the office tomorrow. Rhodey, Happy, you both are welcome to join us.”
Rhodes shook his head, “As much as I would love to be there and see you guys rip S.H.I.E.L.D. another one, I have to get back to base tomorrow morning and see to the training plans of the new recruits.”
“I can't come either, I have a meeting with the security personnel to discuss a new outline to strengthen our background checks, we can't have another Romanov, screwing us over.” Happy said as a fierce look of determination crossed his features. 
Tony nodded, “ That's fine, I'm sure me and Pep could handle it. Anyway, why don't we call it an early night and hit the sack. We have a secret agency to sue in the morning.”
