Chapter 1



Notes:
So this poor guy didn't get any votes. I'm working on formatting the winner, the Steve/Darcy emails fic, but it's a real pain. I'm new to posting, and the fic heavily relied on different fonts and such to make it easy to understand. So for now, I decided to post this one, because while it didn't get any love in the vote, it was one of my favorites to write.




Chapter Text
Darcy stumbles forward, a pair of bright blue eyes spearing into her own, like a beacon. Brick walls on either side, a godawful smell, and then she sees a big, angry man. Thankfully pointed away from her, but fists swinging.Blue Eyes, her beacon, goes down.“That’ll teach ya to go stickin’ your nose in where it don’t belong.” The big man yells as Darcy tips towards one side, bracing herself against the brick wall. “Don’t got Barnes followin’ ya around now, do ya?”The big man pulls his leg back as Blue Eyes tries to stand up.Darcy grabs the closest trash can lid, has a second to think huh, that’s heavier than I thought it would be and then she brings it down on the big guy’s head.He goes down and Blue Eyes gets up. He’s got narrow shoulders and Darcy can look straight into his eyes standing flat footed. They’re really pretty eyes, with the longest lashes she’s ever seen on a man.“Miss?” Blue Eyes frowns at her, shoving his hands awkwardly in his pockets. He glances towards the bigger man, who lies face down in the alley, then back up at her. Blood begins to drip out of his nose. He opens his mouth and then his eyes widen and he darts forward, catching Darcy as she pitches towards the ground. Darcy comes to on something soft, with a cool cloth dabbing at her forehead. "Jane?!"“There you are now, and look at you.” A young woman with dark brown eyes and brown hair smiles down at her. There’s a worn green ribbon tied in her hair.Darcy sits up in a panic. She’s on a narrow twin bed, the mattress lumpy underneath her, in a room she doesn’t recognize. The lamp on the side table is dim, and she stares at it, not quite comprehending. There’s a flame dancing on a wick. It’s an oil lamp.“There, there. You’re alright now.” The woman says softly, reaching up to dab at Darcy’s cheek with the cool cloth. “Why don’t you tell me where you live? We’ll have someone run over and get your parents.”The woman is wearing an old fashioned dress. Vintage style, except Darcy has a feeling it’s not vintage. She remembers a flash of light. Jane’s scream. A pull.Darcy turns, scrambling for a basin of water. She heaves twice, but nothing comes up.“Rebecca.” A woman says from the doorway. She’s got a stout, sturdy build and a scrutinizing expression. Gray hair streaking through brown. “Why don’t you keep Steven company?”Rebecca gives Darcy an encouraging smile and abandons her seat next to the bed. Darcy sits the rest of the way up, feeling the older woman’s gaze on her.“Ya expectin? Run away from home?”“No ma’am.” Darcy answers automatically. The woman reminds her of her aunt Bev, who hadn’t taken bullshit from anyone and could smell a lie before it even left Darcy’s tongue.The woman nods her head. She wears a stained white apron over a navy dress that is obviously well worn and fraying at the edges. Her stockings sag at the ankles.“Steven says you appeared in a flash of bright light. One second you weren’t there, an’ the next you were.” That scrutinizing look gets even more severe now. Holy Thor, the woman could give most SHEILD agents Darcy had met a run for their money.“Yes ma’am.” Darcy figures honesty is the way to go.“You got a way to get home?”“No ma’am.” Darcy shifts, heart aching. “Not even with a million dollars and my own airplane.”“A million dollars, huh?” She braces her hands on her hips, looking Darcy up and down. Darcy fights against the urge to sit up straighter and loses, and she’s slumped her way through a meeting with Nick Fury and Pepper Potts. “Steve also said you walloped Elridge Hambert upside the head.”Darcy wins the fight and doesn’t fidget, instead raising her chin. “He was going to kick him when he was already down.”The woman looks up at the ceiling in plain exasperation. “Steven! I swear that boy is going to be the death of me.”Darcy says nothing, still trying to take in the room. Like that might tell her where she is. But it’s small, with dingy walls, and a boxy dresser. One window looks over the building immediately next door.“I’m a good Catholic woman, and I love that boy like my own, and trust him more than. He says you appeared in a flash of light, I’m going to believe him.” The woman steps further into the room. “You can stay here on three conditions: you get a job to pay your way, you go to church with us every Sunday and Wednesday, and you never lie to me.”There’s that Aunt Bev look again. Darcy hopes for a bright light to zap her back out again, but she’s left with the woman waiting for her response. Damn you Jane!Darcy spends the rest of the evening in bed. Mrs. Barnes insists.Rebecca brings her dinner, but Mrs. B
