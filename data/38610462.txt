Chapter Text
“What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for, Agent Morse?”“Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.” Bobbi studied Maria, but the woman was as impenetrable as she always was — at least while on the job. Three margaritas and a plate of nachos in at that stupid “Mexican” restaurant she always dragged Bobbi to and Hill was nothing more than another drunken thirty-something at happy hour with her friends.Unfortunately, this was not happy hour, so Bobbi was left to deal with one of her oldest friends asking her a laughably basic question, probably as a lead-up to something.“What does that mean to you?” Maria asked.Bobbi raised an eyebrow. They were doing the touchy-feely stuff now? Not Maria’s normal style, but okay. “It means that I took an oath, to be the shield. To protect the world and the people in it — from aliens, sure, but also from the people who are using aliens as a smokescreen for their own prejudices, or as a leg up in the constant arms race we’re in, with other countries and other entities and anyone else with a finger in the pie. It means that I protect first, and ask questions later. What does this have to do with the mission, Maria?”“It has to do with your new mission,” Maria answered, face still smooth as marble. She turned to the corner of the conference room, bathed in shadows. “Are you happy with her answer?”“I would’ve been happier if I got my first pick,” the man remarked, stepping out of the darkness and into the light.“I would’ve been happier if someone hadn’t lied to my ex-husband about being dead for two years, but we can’t always get what we want, can we, Phil?” Bobbi asked coldly.Phil Coulson was dead. She knew because she’d gotten two calls about it in the middle of the night, one from her ex-husband and one from her ex-…something, both of them distraught but unable to show it. Coulson had been Clint and Natasha’s handler, sure, but more than that, he’d been their friend, their confidante, the first person to believe in them.And he’d lied to them… for what?“You’re upset,” Phil said mildly.“Yes, I’m upset.” Bobbi’s gaze shifted momentarily to Maria, who could only offer a helpless shrug. Judging by Coulson’s comment to her, she wasn’t supposed to have known this secret, because she wasn’t supposed to be… what? On Coulson’s team? “I don’t need to explain to you why, because you already know.”“It wasn’t my choice,” Coulson said steadily. Bobbi shouldn’t have been surprised Coulson passed the buck — it was easy to do within S.H.I.E.L.D., the whole just following orders shtick — but she was, a little. She thought Coulson cared about Clint and Nat more than that. “And for what it’s worth, I did die. It just… didn’t stick.”“You were dead for eight seconds.” Maria rolled her eyes. “Don’t give her that ‘I died’ crap like we put you in the ground.”“Eight seconds of death, eight months of rehab,” Coulson argued.“Why am I here?” Bobbi interrupted before they could start squabbling.“Because my first choice got vetoed,” Coulson answered. “Apparently my roster was, quote, too sketchy.”Bobbi looked to Maria, who shrugged. “He wanted a man who doesn’t know how to work with other people, a woman who’s been retired since 2008, a couple of kids who don’t know which end of the gun shoots, and himself. I call that a time bomb, not a team.”“A woman who’s been retired since ‘08,” Bobbi repeated. “May’s agreed to come along?”“Not yet.” Coulson stuck his hands in his pockets, and Bobbi couldn’t help the small thread of satisfaction winding through her. He was nervous. He didn’t think Melinda would say yes — or if he did think she would, he wasn’t sure of it.Bobbi wouldn’t blame her, after Bahrain.“What makes you think I want to be a part of this time bomb?” Bobbi said, leaning back in her seat. Just because she’d been tapped didn’t mean she had to accept the assignment. Something something, free will, something something.“Because you said you wanted to protect first, ask questions later,” Coulson answered, not removing his hands from his pockets. “We’d be black ops. No red tape.”“I like red tape,” Bobbi protested.Coulson laughed. The bastard. “I cannot imagine Clint Barton marrying anyone who likes red tape.”“We did get a divorce, so there’s that.”“You didn’t divorce over red tape.”“…No,” Bobbi admitted.Coulson took his hands out of his pockets. “You’d be able to pick the ops. No more playing the blonde bimbo arm candy to politicians who need protection or getting passed over because your higher-ups assume you’re just a pretty face.”Bobbi didn’t bite her lip, even if she wanted to. Anyone with half a brain would know she was more than a pretty face. She’d done more deep undercover work than almost any other agent — except Natasha, but that was the exception to basically every statement made about a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent’s prowess.“If they ask me, I’m not going to lie to them.”“They’re not level seven,” Hill put in, though her voice lacked any remonstration
