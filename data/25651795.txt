Chapter Text

“ We’re going to Stark Industries!”
  
Peter Parker-Stark could feel all the blood leaving his face, faintly he heard the cheers of his classmates, and Flash’s voice taunting him but he was lost to the world currently.

They were going to Stark Industries. The place he works at, more importantly, the place that he owns! 
 
A hand grabbed his and he snapped back into reality to see MJ hold his hand under the desks. Her outward appearance didn’t change as she still had her nose in a book but just a slight squeeze of her hand made him breathe a little. 
 “Hey Parker! You can give up your lies about your  Stark Internship  and we promise not to make fun of you too much!” Flash smirked while his buddies behind him jeered and cackled. I mean they weren’t wrong he doesn’t intern at Stark Industries... he actually owns it, well he shares it with Pepper Potts-Stark. 
You see, after the Snap and Tony’s funeral May and Peter moved in with Pepper and Morgan, well more like Peter did, May now lived with Happy (a fact that weirds him out to this day). When they went through Tony’s will they found that he had left Peter as heir to Stark Industries and to help keep the Board off Pepper’s back and from going back to manufacturing weapons he took over as Head of R&D, not that anyone outside the company knew (NDAs and all). He was taking MIT courses while in high school so he could finish up school as soon as possible, it helped that Harley and Cassie were also taking MIT courses so he didn’t feel as alone. Ned and MJ were also some of the best support, making sure he ate, slept, and regularly conversed with other beings besides an AI so he didn’t lose it. 
 
Once class was over he packed up his stuff and was ready to go home but Mr.Harrington called him over quickly. He had a stern yet guilty look on his face, his tone mimicking his face.
 
“Peter, I understand that it is tough with everything happening and that you live alone with your aunt, but I don’t want you to spread this internship story when we go on the trip. Lying won’t get you any positive attention.”
 
Peter stared at him with his jaw hanging open. Of course! Of course the staff don’t even believe me! He shut his mouth close and without saying anything he walked out of the classroom. MJ had left already as she had a doctors appointment and Ned was on a date with Betty, so he just walked straight to the car that was waiting for him. 
 
Slipping into the back he gave a slight greeting to Happy before staring out the window. “ How was School kid?” Happy kept glancing at the mirror with a concerned look. Normally the kid would be talking his ear off, even after the funeral, while he didn’t speak as much as before he still spoke quite a lot. Shrugging his shoulders he muttered “it was fine” clearly ending the conversation. The drive back to the cabin was silent, but as they reached closer to their destination Peter began to relax, “ My class is going on a trip to Stark Industries and my teacher and classmates think that I’m just an attention seeker and the moment they realize that I don’t just work there but I run the place they’ll start sucking up to me so they can get things out of me.” Happy shook his head, “damn kid, you never get a break do you?” “Ha! I know right? I have that stupid Parker Luck even when I’m now a Stark!”   
 
They reached the cabin and within three seconds of entering the house he was attacked by tiny child. “Petey! You’re back! I missed you! Guess what?! I’ve decided when I grow up I’m either going to become an Overlord or a fairy princess!” Any anxiety that Peter had quickly disappeared. Smiling down at the little girl he hauled her over his shoulder and walked to the kitchen to find the one person he needed with a comforting smile and immediately pulled him into a hug and gave forehead kiss. 
 
You know what?
  
He’d be fine.
 




Notes:

So for clarification, Since Cassie wasn’t one of the victims of the first Snap she grew at a normal rate, making her about sixteen, the same age as Peter and Harley. So with that fact she, Peter, and Harley got along very well, since they were all affiliated with superhero parental figures, and they were all extremely smart (let’s say for a fact that Cassie is a genius), and absolute nerds. No I’m not replacing MJ or Ned, I actually think that MJ and Cassie would probably contemplate the idea of murdering the guys because of their stupidity, and Ned and Harley would frequently hack into government files and post it on Tumblr with a bunch of memes. And if we add Shuri and Peter friendship into the mix the four would be trying to stop them from pranking everyone in the compound (probably make synthetic lava for “The Floor is Lava!”)
