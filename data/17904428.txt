Chapter Text

Five
When the portal had successfully taken the six of them moments before a piece of the moon crashed on their location, he felt the familiar rush of his power, except this time it kept on expanding and expanding to accommodate them all. His eyes remained close, focusing on the given time frame he has in mind.2002. They had to go back seventeen years ago, before his disappearance, before Ben’s death, when they were under Reginald’s care. There was no need for the training, of course, but they do need to confront their adoptive father concerning Vanya. He wouldn’t trust Reginald with Vanya’s lessons on control because that did so well for them and the Earth. But Five wasn’t there last time, and that made a huge difference. No, they would take matters in their own hands this time with his lead, seeing as they weren’t completely useless under the right guidance and command.The mansion had already taken form in his mind’s eye, with lesser peeling wallpapers, less dusty furniture, and an atmosphere that wasn’t home, per se, but made it felt lived-in. Grace was in the kitchen, Pogo tending the garden, Reginald in his study, and the seven of them minding their own businesses behind the closed-doors of their respective bedrooms. It wasn’t a rare occasion but more of a routine that he remembered having to stomach for more than a decade.All of a sudden, pain sliced through him like a hot knife, making him hyper-aware of the surrounding space pressing against him on all sides, suffocating him, them. He was pushing past his limit now, given that time traveling should only feel like a breeze, the whole ordeal much quicker when he had done it alone. This one seemed to drag for too long, as if with the intent of tearing him limb by limb.He felt the hands holding on both of his squeezing tighter, holding on for life or afraid that he might be separated. His own hands gripped them back with equal strength, and while he had forgotten which was which hand-in-hand, he wouldn’t let go of anyone.Because while it was much easier to do this by himself, the knowledge that he wouldn’t be on his own anymore no matter what timeline they landed was comforting.For what seemed like forever, the distant noise of thunder cracked. There was the sensation of falling until he met the ground. His hiss of pain was overpowered by the collective groans of his siblings from their ungraceful landing. A few distances away from him, he heard Klaus sputtering out sand from his mouth.Sand. A fucking sand.There was no nearby sound of the crashing waves or any body of water for that matter. Instead, there were guns aimed at them by a handful of men and women in suits. He couldn’t recognize any of their uncovered faces, but they definitely smelled like the Temps Commission.He counted at least twenty armed men and judging by their more advanced tech, this was a different branch of the Commission. He did hear before about them dealing with the integration of technology from an assortment of centuries forward and backward.“We’ll appreciate it if you could put your hands behind your back and make no step further. This could go down peacefully, young gentlemen and ladies,” said a calm voice, clearly a man with authority.Luther pulled him by his shoulder, placing himself in front of his siblings. Vanya, who remained unconscious, was now carried by Diego. Luther might no longer have his huge body to shield them, but he did make sure that they were a tight-knit group.“We meant you no harm,” Luther said. Immediately, he was taken aback by his own young voice until he cleared his throat, trying to sound like he was speaking for them. “Our sister needs medical attention, so let us be on our way.”Five almost wanted to smack him. Idiot. But then again, Luther’s decisions were dumb at most since he tried to take the mantle of the leader.Not a chance with Five.“Can I speak to your superior?” Five stepped up, letting his volume carry to the man who spoke earlier. “I believe he has questions for us that he would like to be answered.”The armed men exchanged glances, eyes flitting to the woman who made a gesture. There was a chuckle from the back, and two men emerged.Both higher-ups, alright, but Five was guessing that the black man with an eyepatch preceded the shorter man with a receding hairline and austere face.“So, boy,” the man with eyepatch began, “Or are you really a boy, or is that how you and your kind appear from where you came from?”Five frowned. “Is that supposed to be a joke?”An eyebrow rose before his expression morphed into no-nonsense. “Look, you are not fooling anyone here. I don’t know what’s with you aliens that you have a thing for Earth, but either you prove yourselves that you’re not a threat like Thor or you’re invade
