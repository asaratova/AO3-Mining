No one is sure of what lurks in the depths of the abyss. All it's known about it it's the darkness and the cold; the dangers that roam through it are just slightly more known, reports of fast predators that see everything as their prey, stories that speak of creature’s unknown to humanity.

So, why is that you chose to come down there, knowing the dangers, the rumors. It was to prove your friend was wrong? It was to show that the myths are real? Was it your friend’s belief you are immortal? To finally find something that could best you in battle?

Whatever your reasons.

They don’t matter anymore.

Not when 

he

 finds you.

And what a creature he is. Ghost white almost translucent skin, pure black eyes that seem to watch in every direction and also no place at all, sharp shark like teeth, blood dripping from his mouth, a chunk of your arm on his mouth.

You are not sure how he got into the submariner.

You are not sure if your friends are even alive anymore.

If they are alive you are sure to kill the one who suggested this trip.

If they are dead you will kill them when you meet again in another life.


He

 takes a step forward; you take one back.


He

 smiles at your actions; you know you are screwed.

But you also don’t want to die.

So, you run.


He

 follows,

and 

he

 is 

faster

.

You don’t even make it out of the room before 

he

 grabs your arm and bites down on your shoulder. 

He

 tears another chunk of your body; you wonder how many you can lose.

A weird guttural sound comes from behind you; you know what it is but don’t want to react, don’t want to show you notice 

his

 laugh, 

his

 haunting and so human laugh.

Monsters aren’t supposed to make sounds like that.

Silence fills the room again and you are considering running again, 

he

 is still behind you, you can feel the cold sensation of 

his 

body behind you. Cold like a corpse.

Like your friends most likely are now.

Like you will be soon.

Are monsters supposed to be this cold?

You don’t know, don’t care anymore actually, and turn around.

You stare at the creature in the eyes. Take a deep breath and spread your arms, your immortality would end someday anyways.

Why not let the king of the deeps be the one who ends you?

The creature stares at you, something akin to confusion on 

his

 face, seems like this is not the usual reaction of his victims.

You smile, exposing your neck for the creature;

 he

 keeps staring, but finally, 

he

 smiles. It is not even a monstrous smile, it looks smug, like the one your bastard friend threw at you before this trip.

You wonder if he still is alive or if the creature already devoured him.

A genuine laugh leaves the creature's mouth, like if you told him the funniest joke in the world.


He

 closes the distance between your bodies and takes your head between 

his

 hands, the smile still on 

his

 lips, gets 

his

 head close to your ear and murmurs something in a language you don’t understand.

But you don’t need to, to know what 

he

 means.


He

 is quick, sinks 

his

 teeth on your skin for the last time you will be aware of, and while everything goes dark you wonder if in the next life you could meet this creature again.

You hope you can.
