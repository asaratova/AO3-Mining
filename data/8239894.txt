Chapter Text
There was something about the building that Bucky detested: it left a foul feeling in the pit of his stomach. He wasn't sure if it was the black stone; or how unnecessarily tall it was in comparison to the church beside it; or the large, recently-shined, golden plaque by the front door: The Howard Stark Companion Home for Young Ladies, est. 1891. But something about it was rubbing the Sergeant the wrong way, and he couldn't quite figure out why.“Buck, everything will be fine,” Steve soothed, after seeing the frown appear on Bucky's face. “If you don't want to look here, we can go somewhere else. I'm sure there's more than one House in Brooklyn.”“There isn't,” Bucky said with the shake of his head. “We're almost in Manhattan as it is. The next one is in Albany, unless we go into Jersey. You really wanna go to Jersey, Stevie?”The expression on Steve's face was clear: the trip from Brooklyn to Albany, or into New Jersey, was not something either man desired. The carriage ride from one end of Brooklyn to the other had already been stressful enough. People weaved in and out of the streets, walking and yelling and running. Fellow drivers – coachmen, and higher class, and others – rode on carriages, and in the new contraptions called motorcars, and atop bicycles. Several times, they'd both considered simply getting out and walking the remainder of the way.“Here we are, sirs,” the coachman, some young man barely old enough to enlist, informed. Steve paid him a dollar as he and Bucky stepped onto the sidewalk, before the carriage slowly rolled away.“We are walking back,” Bucky hissed into Steve's ear a moment later.Once Steve had a proper look at the building, something moved. One of the curtains covering a ground floor window shifted just enough for someone's eye to poke through – before it returned to its normal place. It was mid-morning on a Sunday, so it was most likely a servant instead of a pupil, who would – no doubt – be in the middle of a service.“We're certainly in the right place,” Steve commented on the golden plaque as the two of them walked up the front set of stairs.Bucky took the knocker and rapped it against the door a few times. “I should hope so. It's certainly gloomy enough to be a House – or an orphanage.”“Buck,” Steve chided softly, before the door was opened, and a young parlor maid of about sixteen answered. As miserable as the outside of the building appeared, her uniform was tidy and well-made, save for a few scuffs on her apron.“Sirs?” she prompted. Both Steve and Bucky tipped their hats.“My name is Captain Steven Rogers,” Steve replied politely, “and this is Sergeant James Barnes. We have an appointment with the head of this House.”Bucky, having barely noticed the minuscule bronze plague underneath the larger golden one, added, “A Madame Potts?” He gestured to the sign, which read, Overseen by Madame V. P. Potts. The young maid nodded before stepping aside to allow them entry, then ushering them down a nearby hallway.Bucky had to admit: the House appeared much nicer on the inside. Everything was pristine: shiny, scrubbed tile floors; marble pillars that held up the ceiling; winding staircases (also polished), and sturdy-looking doors. He couldn't see a speck of dust anywhere. There were several framed pictures down the hallway, each with a small bronze or silver plaque: the most recent one stated, Howard Stark Companion House, January 15, 1906, and featured roughly thirty or forty young women from ages ten to twenty or so, each in the same House uniform. It was only the first floor, but if the rest of the House was up to this standard, it might not be an awful place – not like some of the other Houses Bucky had heard about.At the end of the hall, there was a door with another bronze plaque – Madame Potts – and the maid knocked quickly. “Madame, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are here.”“Send them in,” a female voice called. The maid opened the door for them, dropped a curtsy, and allowed them to slip past her before she closed it.The office was equally nice: a large oak desk, covered in neatly stacked papers; several wooden chairs; a large window with long red drapes and a black lounge chair under it; and a few other pieces of furniture, including a clothing rack and a steel safe. Behind the desk, to both Steve's and Bucky's surprise, was a thin, poised red-headed woman in her mid-thirties. (Bucky had been expecting a vulture-like woman with a hooked nose and deep wrinkles.) She stood when they entered – she was quite tall – and she politely shook both of their hands before they sat in two of the chairs in front of the desk.“Captain. Sergeant. I'm so humbled that you would choose this establishment,” Madame Potts said with a small smile after she took her own seat. “You would be surprised by the amount of people who choose to go to Albany instead, based solely on the outer appearance of this building.”“The Dracula's castle motif wasn't in
