Chapter 1: Howard's Mementos
    


Summary:

Prompt: "(OMG SO EXCITED for this blog!) Imagine Tony finding out that even though Steve could get along with him, Bucky never really liked or trusted Howard."





Chapter Text
“What’s all this?” Bucky asks, stepping out of the elevator and weaving his way through the obstacle course that used to be a hallway with Steve hot on his heels, curiously peering into boxes and shifting papers as he goes.“Spring cleaning,” Clint grins, half buried underneath some dozen files on one of the couches. “Flee while you still have the chance!”Tony rolls his eyes from his position on the floor but shoots Bucky a small smile as he approaches. “Just, you know. Getting rid of some stuff. And,” he adds, turning to glare at Clint, “no one forced you to help, you invited yourself.”Clint just waves his hand in a clear ‘yeah, whatever’ gesture, completely absorbed in a folder with a big, red classified stamp on the cover.Before Bucky can form a reply to any of that, Steve straightens up from where he had been crouching down next to an old cabinet, an unreadable expression on his face as he says, voice tight and disapproving, “You can’t throw this out.”Tony’s jaw tightens, but he doesn’t look up from the box he’s sorting through. “It’s mostly junk, Steve. Take it if you want it.”“These were Howard’s things,” Steve goes on, stubborn as always, and crosses his arms over his chest.“As I said, feel free to take them,” Tony sniffs dismissively, but there’s a certain tension under the forced nonchalance.And while this thing between him and Tony is still new, while it’s still hard sometimes to differentiate between what Tony’s saying and what the words actually mean, Bucky definitely knows Steve and how the way he straightens his back and squares his shoulders means he’s gearing up to argue.Not out of malice, that’s not like Steve, but the Howard he remembers and the Howard Tony knew were two completely different people, and Bucky is well aware that Steve continues to struggle with adjusting to the fact that he’s missed so much while being under the ice.He hasn’t outright said it, though Bucky is fairly sure Steve also feels guilty and somehow responsible for Howard’s actions and behaviour toward Tony, however ridiculous that notion might be.None of which excuses the bull in a china shop approach he keeps taking in his well-intended but poorly-received attempts to get Tony to open up and talk.“Leave it alone, Stevie,” Bucky warns, just sharp enough to let him know that he’s serious, and Steve narrows his eyes at him but huffs and relents after another moment, which is apparently enough for Tony to meet Steve halfway. “I know you guys were all buddy-buddy in the old days,” he sighs, gesturing at Bucky and Steve as he rubs a tired hand over his face. “But dad and me, we were never close. It was shitty and I resented him for a long time and blamed him for a lot of my issues, still do sometimes, but that’s not your problem. Really, if there’s something you want, go ahead and take it. You were friends and that’s fine, I get it.”“Honestly?” Bucky starts with a little, one-shouldered shrug, and Steve’s lips purse because he knows Bucky, too, that goes both ways. “I always thought he was kind of a pretentious dick.”That is followed by a few seconds of complete and utter silence, broken eventually by Tony snorting out an almost giddy laugh that turns into throaty giggles as he holds out his hand for Bucky to take and pulls him down next to him for a kiss.“I knew there was a reason you were my favourite,” he grins against Bucky’s lips and Bucky can practically hear Steve roll his eyes at that, grinning right back and playfully nudging Tony’s nose with his own.“Yeah,” Clint pipes up, amused and very obviously up to no good, “I’m sure the moaning everyone heard last night has nothing to do with how you pick your favourites, Tin Can.”Steve groans, pulling a face, and Bucky tucks his face into Tony’s neck to muffle his chuckles.Tony throws a crumpled-up piece of paper at a cackling Clint, but Bucky can feel him smile against the side of his head.
