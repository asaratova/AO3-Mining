 ************************************************************************************************************************************* 
Some nights I thirst for real blood. For real knives. For real cries. And then the flash of steel from real guns, in real life, really fills my mind.

I really miss what really did exist, when I held your throat so tight.
 ************************************************************************************************************************************* The bottle was heavy where it dangled from Wade’s fingers, held lazily by the neck as he brought it back to his lips. The amber-colored liquid burned the raw skin of his mouth, swiping cold heat over his tongue and prickling his throat when he swallowed it down. It was a comforting pain. Familiar. It lulled him into a dull numb ache that smothered the sharper, knife-edged agony still tearing at his insides. The deeper suffering that had sunk its teeth into him. The one he wasn’t thinking about.“Come on, dude!” The greasy-haired, bespectacled man behind the bar flicked his dirty dishrag at Wade’s arm. “That’s my last fuckin’ Blue Label and I’m not getting another shipment of Johnny ‘till Wednesday.”Wade didn’t even bother to shrug. He just took another swig of the top-shelf whiskey, letting a bit of it dribble down the scarred skin of his chin just to spite Weasel. He reached up with his other gloved hand to scratch at the edge of his mask, which was only rolled up to his nose even though there was no one else in Sister Margaret’s at the moment. It was still too early for the after-dinner crowd. He found himself wishing, once again, that the bottle and a half of hard liquor he’d downed in the last hour could knock him the fuck out. Or at least get him shit-faced enough that he couldn’t remember his name.{I’d give anything. Kill anyone. Bend the fuck over and take it from the fucking Hulk if only we could get drunk. Black out drunk. Right now.}[There are other ways. Just hang on until tonight.] White soothed them both, a calm patch of reason amidst the hurricane that had blown through Wade’s head. [We’ll be fine until then.]Wade grunted his affirmation, though he didn’t let himself dwell long on the thought. “You know I’m good for it.” He mumbled to Weasel, a bit belatedly. The bartender scoffed. “Yeah, fuck face. I know.” He started stacking glasses near the tap in preparation for the evening’s influx of patrons. “Shit. Never seen anyone take so many jobs in one weekend. Even you gotta take breaks, right? Give that trigger finger a little rest.”[No. No breaks. Get back to your routine. The blood helps.]{Helps…}[Helps you remember who you are.]“I wouldn’t be taking this break if you would just give me another fucking mark.” Wade growled, flicking a peanut shell off the bar and hitting Weasel on the forehead.“Ow! What the fuck, man.” He rubbed obligatorily between his eyes, shooting Wade a mildly irritated look. “I told you, I’m all out. You did nine fucking jobs in less than two days, Wilson. It usually takes a week to do that many when I’m dealing to the whole group.” He grimaced. “Jareth’s gonna be pissed tonight, by the way. And I’m gonna tell him it was you who took his card.”Wade waved his bottle carelessly through the air, brushing Weasel off. “Like I couldn’t take a fucker who names himself after the mother-trucking Goblin King. Even if I could bleed out, I wouldn’t worry about that asshole’s cute little stilettos.”[Bea and Arthur have much better extension than those idiotic blades. What kind of mercenary chooses a pocket knife as his weapon of choice, anyway?]Wade nodded. “B and A would love to show off.” He muttered under his breath. His babies had had their thirst thoroughly quenched these past thirty-nine hours, but they could always spill a little more blood. Even better if it belonged to a merc.“You’re in a mood.” Weasel remarked, voice taking on a more serious tone that had Wade tipping the Johnny Walker back to his lips to chug down the rest. He was pleased to see the bartender flinch at his blasphemous actions.“What’s your damage? Cat run away cause even animals can’t stand your meat-grinder mug?” He gave up wiping uselessly at the counter top and crossed his arms to lean against the grimy surface instead. “Trouble in paradise? What’s the deal with your little – ”The muzzle of Wade’s gun pressed tight to Weasel’s jaw, moving ever so slightly as the man jerked and swallowed, muscles shifting beneath his skin. Wade had drawn Dick (his Desert Eagle) before the next w
