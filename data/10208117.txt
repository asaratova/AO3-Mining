Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“Just like that,” Brock said softly, running his hands through her wet hair. Her curls were lank and sticking to her bare skin as she mouthed along the length of his cock. His thumb came up to smear her mascara further down her cheek.

What could he say, he was into the tear-stained look. It did things for him. Just like her hot little tongue was doing things for him.

He fisted his fingers in her hair as she went deep down onto him, and she made a soft huffing noise when he pressed her further, her eyes widening in panic.

“You gonna say it?” he asked, teasing two fingers down her nose, threatening to cut off her last source of air. She choked for a moment and then nodded, a quick jerk of her chin. He let her pull back, his smirk spreading wide as she looked down at the floor of the shower and mumbled,

“Hail Hydra.”
