Steve leaned back on the sofa, set his sketchpad aside, and tugged at the neckline of his sweatshirt. He was waiting for the others to arrive for a team debrief. It was going to be a long one; they'd stopped a suitcase nuke attack in DC, and everybody had been on edge, not sleeping much, barely getting a bite to eat. This peaceful moment between activities was the first he'd had for ages.The top of Stark Tower was temperature-controlled and everyone seemed to find it comfortable, but he thought the air-conditioning always made Tony's place a few degrees too chilly. Today, though, as the mid-afternoon sun reflected light from other skyscrapers, Steve felt downright hot.A glance Clint's way confirmed it; there were beads of sweat popping along his temple. Steve made to rise, planning to track down Tony in the adjacent adjunct lab and let him know his system was on the fritz before the meeting, but Clint grabbed his thigh in a tight pinch. Questioning, Steve leaned over, but Clint just angled his head to gesture across the vast room at one of the easy chairs in front of the giant television.Natasha was sitting sideways across Bruce's lap, grinding rhythmically as his hands roamed over her back, and it looked like were kissing. Scratch that; it looked like they were trying to eat each other's faces."Geez," breathed Steve."We should get popcorn," Clint whispered."I'm full," Steve whispered back. "Those chocolates..."Clint gave him a "you idiot" look and Steve got it."Oh. Right. Popcorn." But it really wasn't right to sit there gawping at the floor show, Steve thought, even if Natasha and Bruce had forgotten they were in public. Tony's main living area had become the default meeting location for the team. Mostly because of the foosball table, and the TV that was like a 12-foot-tall hologram (you could even walk through it!) Plus, there were always snacks."We should-" Steve began, but Clint's hand clasped his thigh tighter, and his fingers splayed out along the seam of his khaki pants and stroked before sliding upward. "Clint?" he ventured, but that was as far as he got before Clint turned swiftly and pressed his mouth to his.Steve felt a different sort of heat race up his spine and, unaccountably, thought well, hang it, and kissed him back.  By the time Tony walked in, licking his fingers goddamn, that was some fucking great candy, the party was in full swing, with Natasha's clothes mingled with Bruce's in a series of little heaps across the vast floor. She was on the area rug riding Clint, Bruce's mouth was wrapped around Steve's cock perpendicular to them, thumbs digging into Steve's taut stomach, and the only sounds in the room were gasps and moans, punctuated by the slap of flesh against flesh.Tony almost dropped his heavily-modded iPad, but managed to catch it against the front of his legs. "What's this? A pants-off dance-off?" he demanded.  Steve managed a weak wave and threw his head back in pleasure. "Oh, yeah, Bruce, right...right there," he groaned, clutching at Bruce's shoulders.Tony stepped into the center of the room and set down his gear. "Guys, seriously..." he began, before pulling his shirt over his head. He fell to a crouch and ran the flat of his palm along the curve of Natasha's back, and purring, she rolled over, still attached to Clint.Tony kissed him first. Natasha didn't seem to mind; she quickly pulled Steve over to join them and licked playfully at his upper lip as Bruce began to massage Steve's behind with broad strokes.When Thor arrived a few minutes later, he didn't drop Mjölnir, thankfully. He simply strode over, stripped, and dropped to the floor, shouldering his way into the group like a boot camp soldier under barbed wire, licking Steve's offered fingers as he pulled them from Natasha. She moaned, Tony kissed her, and Steve groped his way up the front of Thor's thighs, planting love bites as he went. Bruce captured Thor's lips in a desperate kiss, slipping his fingers through his hair.  Tony and Natasha utilized the sofa for leverage, and were joined by (and with) Steve. Bruce and Clint almost rolled into the windows more than a few times, and Thor learned what the term "Lucky Pierre" meant on Midgard. (On Asgard, a similar phrase meant you got the last piece of cake.) The next thing Steve was aware of, really aware, was the cool rush of air conditioning on his ass and the muted sound of a Yankees game on the television. He raised his head, which stuck just a bit to Thor's bare abdomen. Steve wiped his jaw and glanced around him, to see Natasha, leaning against the front of the sofa, stretching her arms and blinking confusedly and Clint lazily pulling the nearest piece of dropped clothing over his crotch. Tony shook his head as if it was full of bees, Bruce rubbed his face repeatedly, and Thor exhaled into a loud snore. Natasha gave his side a nudge with her bare foot, and he awoke with a start and looked around him."So," Tony spoke first. "I guess we had an orgy instead
