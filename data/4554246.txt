Bucky doesn’t blame them, honestly, he doesn’t, but knowing that the fault lies with himself isn’t exactly a comforting thought, especially coupled with the sort of crippling loneliness that comes with being deemed a danger to society and kept in total isolation.Okay, that may be a slight exaggeration, although going by how Bucky feels about his current situation, it really doesn’t seem like it.He has access to his and Steve’s apartment, the communal floors as well as the gym and the labs, so that whatever’s left of SHIELD doesn’t have to drag him halfway across town every single time they need him for some more tests or another evaluation.Which is often.Too often, Bucky thinks, but doesn’t say.He doesn’t say much at all, these days, preferring to blend into the shadows and be ignored over being stared at with mistrust, disgust or, worst of all, fear.They try to hide it, Bucky can see the effort they all put into making him more comfortable, but Bucky isn’t stupid, he knows they’d rather have him somewhere else, somewhere far away from their home, the place where they’re supposed to feel happy and safe, no matter how passionately Steve insists that isn’t true.But Steve is an idealist, Steve doesn’t understand that people who’ve never known Steve's Bucky, the Bucky before the war and HYDRA, who’ve only ever known him as a mindless mass murderer, don’t have any reason to trust him or want him close. They’re accepting Bucky into their midst because they care about Steve, as a favour to Steve, not out of the good of their hearts or a desire to rehabilitate something that is, almost certainly, broken beyond repair.Bucky has mentioned this to Steve, once. The heartbroken look, damp eyes and hoarse whisper of his name it earned him have convinced him not to try again. So Bucky continues to let Steve drag him to dinners with his friends, conversations coming to abrupt and awkward halts the moment they step into the room, and movie nights where everyone sits cramped together in the armchairs or down on the floor, nowhere near the spot on the couch Steve had made Bucky’s by pushing Bucky into the first time around.Steve is doing what he’s convinced is the right thing, as usual, only that right doesn’t always mean good or nice, and feeling completely, devastatingly alone in a room full of people definitely isn’t either of those.The only person Bucky hasn’t met so far in the three weeks he’s been out of what Steve calls a hospital and Bucky thinks of as just another circle of hell, is Stark.Howard’s son, apparently. Away on business somewhere halfway around the world but probably hearing all about the huge mistake he’s made in allowing Bucky into his house from the rest of the tower’s residents.It’s really no wonder that Bucky is less than enthusiastic about meeting the man he owes everything to, from the roof over his head to the clothes on his back.You only get one chance at a first impression, and Bucky didn’t even get to make his himself.

Bucky shuffles into the shared kitchen shortly before four in the morning for some of Doctor Banner’s herbal tea, a nasty concoction that always reminds him of veggies left out of the fridge for a little too long, but never fails to put him right back to sleep after being woken by dreams he stubbornly refuses to analyze or even think about.He still gets this knot in his stomach whenever he pulls out one of the teabags, something in the back of his mind itching and screaming at him to go ask permission first despite Steve having assured him, time and again, that Doctor Banner doesn’t mind sharing at all.The tea is instantly forgotten, however, when Bucky steps into the room only to find Stark sitting at the bar, laptops, plural, open in front of him and papers scattered all around him, marker poised and ready and a phone wedged between his ear and shoulder, talking a mile a minute in rapid, flawless Japanese.How Bucky knows what language he’s hearing, never mind that Stark’s pronunciation is perfect, well, he figures it’s better not to dwell on that.None of all that is what completely throws Bucky for a loop, though, the reason for him freezing in the doorway is the tiny person perched on Stark’s right leg, swinging his little feet and gurgling happily as he crumples what looks suspiciously like an official and probably important document.Stark seems to come to the same conclusion a moment later, letting out a tired sigh and asking whoever’s on the other end of the line to hold, setting the phone down on the bar before gently, and unsuccessfully, trying to pry the paper out of the boy’s hands.“Peter, cupcake, love of my life, please give Daddy his contract back,” Stark coaxes to no avail, the boy, Peter, obviously finding Stark’s retrieval attempts hilarious, going by the excited shrieking. Stark groans, pinching the bridge of his nose, voice low and resigned as he asks, “I don’t suppose you’re ready to go back to bed yet, huh?”“No, no, no,” Peter babbles and flails
