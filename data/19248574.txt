Chapter Text
2011. Two thousand eleven. Everyone seemed to have an opinion on some movie series about vampires that sparkled, and even stronger opinions on the books they had been created from. Music was loud. Really loud. Though, perhaps, not as loud as a few decades previously. Every place that once held neon lights and billboards now seemed to have giant, color television screens strung up. A lot of people joked about something called the 'meat dress' that had been worn a year earlier by some musician that called herself Lady Gaga. People were also taking pictures of themselves...laying on things. They called it 'planking' and they shared the pictures with the world. They did not need to be famous photographers for the world to have access to these pictures. Things weren't all situated on a scale between confusing and awful, though. Women were able to join all branches of the military now, and there had not been a world war in almost 70 years. There were also dishwashers in most kitchens. Those were great.Truly, it was as different from 1945 as 1945 was from the year 1700. Or earlier, most likely. Technology had exploded, thanks in no small part to the war. What had once been solutions to problems presented by amoral Nazi-Hydra soldiers had given rise to computers, and internet, and 'smartphones.' When Steve Rogers had gone down into the ice in that plane, the last thing he expected was to wake up almost 70 years later. And yet, somehow, things kept surprising him. In his absence, the people he cared about had founded an organization that had sought to uphold everything he'd stood for. Or, well, everything the world had perceived him to stand for. They seemed to be doing alright on that front, but then he also had 70 years of history to catch up with.His world what still reeling two weeks later. Well, two weeks after he'd woken up. They'd told him he'd been asleep but unfrozen for several days as his body finally had the chance to heal. As opposed to being, well, frozen. They'd had more than a week from the day they found him to the day he woke up, and yet they couldn't actually do enough research to know what year what team won. He wasn't mad at them. Now that he was sure this was real – which had been a hard enough pill to swallow – he appreciated that they hadn't just woken him up by waving the latest trending hashtag in his face. Or however that stuff worked. This wasn't his New York. But...it also was. His legacy had helped protect the people who would go on to have the kids and grandkids and great-grandkids who would create and do these strange things.Well, for the most part. There was also the Stark legacy to keep in mind. The news loved Stark's son, and Stark's son loved the attention. As yet another segment about the man popped up, Steve turned off the news. No one had announced his return, though he'd been told by one of the agents, Natasha, who had been assigned to assist him that the scene he'd made in Times Square had garnered some attention. People thought there was a new Captain America-and-SHIELD themed show coming to Broadway soon. The agent suspected there probably would be now, even if it didn't make historical sense. People didn't usually care about what made historical sense. They cared about what entertained them.She'd taught him about the internet, and made it clear that money was no object. If he needed to purchase something, SHIELD was going to foot the bill. It was the least America could do in return for everything he'd sacrificed, or so they said.He'd started trying to learn about the lives of his surviving friends. That had been heartwarming – so many of them had gone on to have families, and it looked like their lives had been satisfying. Jim Morita's grandson was a high school principal in Queens. Maybe Steve would try to meet him one of these days. Tell him stories, and listen to his stories. Eventually, curiosity had gotten the better of him and he'd clicked into his own file. He expected the unending praise – that seemed to be the default way of addressing all veterans from the war, regardless of how famous they'd become. He hadn't expected to see a full analysis of his family history. He hadn't expected to have enough family history for them to analyze it. And yet - There was his father, and through his father he found out about his aunt. He remembered his father showing him a picture of her, once. It was a different picture than the one they had in her file - the only picture she'd had taken with her family before she'd disappeared. His father had assumed his younger sister had died in a factory accident when she was fourteen. She certainly wouldn't have been the only one. Sometimes, back at the turn of the century, families, especially immigrant families such as hers, were easily separated. They didn't have all this technolo
