Chapter 1: Prelude
    




Chapter Text
They'd met in grade school, when Natasha’s family moved from New York to Bangor to try and give their younger daughter a more peaceful environment. They’d chosen Bangor because Dad had been unexpectedly headhunted for a job there. Clint lived next door: when Natasha’s parents found out he had two fathers (and blue-collar ones at that), she was expressly forbidden from speaking to him. For little Natasha, who had never been invited to a birthday party or a sleepover, the temptation was irresistible. She hunted him down the next day at school and demanded he become her best friend. Her family had moved to a bigger house a couple of years later, but Clint and Natasha hadn’t spent more than a week apart since then.When they were younger Bruce and Clint had been in loads of sports teams together and the three of them had spent every lunch time messing about on the field or sneaking off to get fries from the burger place down the road. Other friends had come and gone, but with the three of them it was different.The first permanent addition to the gang had been Steve, back in sixth grade. Bruce, Clint and Natasha had been walking to the derby rink across town when they found a gang of big, burly boys in the Worthington High uniform blocking the pedestrian overpass above the motorway. They were shoving a smaller figure back and forth, a boy even shorter than Natasha with a puff of blonde hair and blood trickling from his nose.Natasha had felt her heart race and a snarl form on her lips as one of the teens hoisted the boy up by his shoulders and tried to set him on the concrete rail of the overpass, thirty feet above a stream of speeding cars and trucks. Natasha heard him yelling, “You like gymnastics so much, Hill? How’s your balance beam? Come on, dance for us!”Most of the boys started cheering as the smaller kid crouched on top of the railing, trying to get down to safety but pushed back by the wall of muscled bullies. Natasha stepped forward, but it was Bruce who lunged in first – Natasha had never seen him so angry. He was roaring as he shoved the nearest Worthington eighth-grader down. The guy fell hard. Clint and Natasha were close behind, and the older kids were so surprised that they stumbled back until they saw who they were being attacked by.Clint grabbed the scrawny kid’s hands and helped him down, but the leader of the Worthington thugs launched himself at them with his fists raised. Before he reached them, one of his friends jumped in and grabbed him.“Hey, bro, forget it,” the intervener soothed. He was a broad-shouldered blond with an ugly rat’s tail down the back of his neck. “They’re just dumb kids. You’ll get suspended, man.”The leader sneered, but finally brushed his friend’s hands off and turned away. Pulling a few crude gestures and yelling at the younger group, the bullies jogged off. The boy with the rat’s tail paused to glance at their victim, who was wiping his bloody nose with his sleeve, but followed his friends.“Yeah, you run! You fucking psychopaths!” Clint barked after them.“Dank you,” the small boy said, holding his nose. “I’m Steve.”“I’m Natasha, and this is Bruce and Clint,” she shook his hand when he offered it, as Worthington boys were no doubt trained to do. “We’ll take you to your school and find someone. You have to tell them what those jerks were doing!”“No. I’m alright. Honestly,” Steve mumbled. “My Mom says I should just ignore them. It usually works.”They’d all gone to the derby together, and started meeting up after school almost every day. Natasha had thought Steve was younger than them, but he turned out to be in their year, and his good sense and cheer balanced out Clint and Natasha’s cynical recklessness well. Most of the time he could even keep up with them on his bike, though he had to stop and use his inhaler quite a lot.---A few weeks later, they’d gone to the movie theatre and found their way blocked by none other than the brawny boy with the blond rat’s tail. He was shifting from foot to foot with his arm’s crossed, watching them until Natasha went up and punched him on the arm.“Hey!” he grabbed her wrist as she tried to again. “I came here to talk to Steve! Stop that-” he had to grab the other wrist.“It’s okay, Nat,” Steve touched her shoulder. “Well?”The boy cleared his throat, glanced around and folded his arms again. “I wanted to say I’m sorry,” he said at last. He cleared his throat. “For what happened on the overpass. Jim was way out of line.”“He was way out of line long before he nearly threw Steve off a fucking bridge,” Clint growled.“I know,” the bigger boy raised his hands. “I made a vow to myself. I’m not going to hang around with them anymore. They’re dickheads.”Bruce chuckled and raised his eyebrows. “You made a vow?”“A vow? Like for a wedding?” Clint smirked.“No! Not like for a wedding!” the boy balled his fists, but then let out a long breath and straightened his back. “Please forgive me, Steve.”“Already forgi
