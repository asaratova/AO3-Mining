Chapter 1: LoL: Riven (prostitution/gokkun)
    




Chapter Text
Riven stared down at her outfit as she reflected on the last few weeks of her life. She was ashamed and guilty of the acts she had committed in the name of the empire, but took strength in her newfound resolve and morality. Unfortunately for her, there was one major issue. Willpower and morals neither put food in her belly nor a roof over her head. And thus, she was forced to utilize the only asset she had left: her body. That was how she found herself in this brothel, wearing a fetishistic bunny outfit complete with floppy ears and a little round tail. Disgraceful attire for the proud soldier who had once commanded her own warband, but what the clients paid for, the clients got.“You’ve been booked for a private party tonight,” the manager had told her earlier. “They're waiting for you in the kennel.” The brothel kept dogs as an extra security measure, but sometimes it was emptied out and used as an extra room for larger groups. “Two rules. No damage, and no cumming inside.” Riven told the crowd of two dozen men as she entered and dropped to her knees, trying to get this over with as fast as possible. They eagerly shuffled in around her, tugging her head and her fake ears as they forcefully encouraged her to suck their cocks. She worked her mouth and tongue and stroked with both hands as best she could until the men grew tired of fucking her mouth, throwing her to her hands and knees.The first man crouched behind her and tore open the crotch of her costume  “Let’s break this bitch in!” he crowed to his fellows, and proceeded to do just that. Riven grunted and tried to remain stoic as man after man took their pleasure from her. True to their word at least, they all pulled out of her sopping cunt before they finished. When at last the sun was rising and the train of men subsided, Riven staggered to her feet and held her hand out for the sack of gold the leader was tossing to himself. “Not just yet,” he taunted, and nudged something with his foot. Apparently when the men hadn’t finished in her cunt, they had all jerked themselves into one of the hound’s food bowls.“If you want this so bad, then you’re gonna hafta guzzle all our jizz.” Riven contemplated the congealing spunk filling the dogbowl, steadying her resolve as she reached for it. “And no hands, lick it up like the animal you are.” With no other option, Riven reluctantly ducked her face into the warm pool of filth..The cloying taste and pungent aroma of sperm mixed with her own juices immediately overrode Riven’s senses as she kept her eyes tightly closed. She took long licks along the bottom of the bowl as she tried to choke down their salty loads as fast as possible. She was disgusted with herself as she ravenously devoured her treat, but the warmth of the cum filling her belly was a welcome respite from both the hunger gnawing her belly and the chilly air. Riven was so lost in her cummy indulgence that she didn’t even notice the slight thud of gold landing next to her head.
