When Tony Stark extended an invitation for Darcy to move into Stark Tower with Thor and Jane, Darcy’s response had been two simple words: “hell” and “yes.”It wasn’t just because she loved Jane (though she did, as well as Jane’s big, muscly soulmate) or because she’d get to be living with superheroes (which she’d already learned could be more trouble than it was worth). The truth was, Stark Tower was the most modern building in the world and she was being offered rent-free housing in the culture capital of America. Since her planned career with SHIELD fell through when it turned out they were secretly a neo-Nazi terrorist organization, New York was as good a place as any to decide her future.She landed at JFK at seven o’clock on a humid July night. By the time she wrestled her bags into a cab and arrived at Stark Tower, it was nearing nine. Jane had offered to have Stark send a car for her, but Darcy had been determined to make the move on her own. She was an official adult moving to a big city with a diploma in her hand, and so was perfectly capable of handling this.(She ignored the fact that her hair was frizzy and she had bags under her eyes and she was kind of on the verge of overwhelmed tears. She was totally handling this.)Stark Tower was all glass and metal, a far cry from her adobe abode in the desert. The disembodied voice of JARVIS, who Jane had warned her about, met her in the elevator. “Good evening, Miss Lewis. Would you like to go to your floor now?”Darcy’s growling stomach answered for her. “Does this place have a kitchen? Specifically a kitchen I can raid without getting my face Hulk-smashed?”“There’s a communal kitchen in the penthouse,” JARVIS told her. “You are free to help yourself to anything you might find there.”“I love you,” she said, resting her head against the stainless steel interior of the elevator.The AI sounded distinctly amused. “It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Miss Lewis.”When the door opened again, Darcy pushed her bags out onto the floor and then followed her nose to the kitchen. There was the smell of garlic and tomatoes in the air, and she was nearly drooling. Maybe Stark had a personal chef that cooked authentic Italian all day. Those peanuts on the plane hadn’t been enough to make up for the fact that she had missed breakfast.The communal floor included a giant living room with a proportionately enormous flat-screen television on the wall. Every game console from the original Nintendo to some system that she had never even seen before seemed to be strewn on the carpet, and controllers snaked across the floor to the collection of leather couches.From the entrance, Darcy had assumed the whole Tower would have the kind of plastic-on-the-furniture oh-God-Darcy-stop-touching-things aesthetic her grandparents' house had, but this area looked thoroughly lived in.When Darcy entered the kitchen, she found a blonde man at the stove, his back turned to her as he stirred the contents of the pan in front of him.With a relieved sigh, she plopped herself down at the counter. Sitting for the violent cab ride had caused more stress than it had soothed, so it felt wonderful to get off her feet."I will give you eight dollars and my firstborn if you let me have some of that," Darcy declared.The man dropped the wooden spoon in his hand and whirled around. "You've got to be kidding me," he said, eyes narrowed and voice harsh. His front was just as good a view as his back. Even if Darcy hadn't done her research on the Tower's occupants, she would have been able to recognize the chiseled jaw and blue eyes of Captain America anywhere."What? I'm hungry," Darcy said, and then his words processed. "No fucking way."----Not everyone had a soulmark, either because not everyone had a soulmate or because the forces that be liked to fuck with a few people specifically.Little girls dreamed of meeting their soulmate. Countless Disney princesses had found their true loves through the line of black words that had appeared on their body containing the first sentence they'd hear their soulmate say. Most girls were thrilled to have a soulmark.Most girls weren't soulmates with complete assholes.The script on the back of Darcy's neck--"Well, at least she's got a nice rack"-- had been haunting her since she was born. Her tits had popped into existence when she turned twelve and hit puberty. Like the stares for the words alone she got weren't bad enough.Does Darcy have a curvy body that she's grown to embrace? Hell yes. Does she want to punch every person who spends more time looking at her breasts than her eyes? Also yes.A few months after she turned 22, another line of text had appeared, this time on her thigh. "You have got to be kidding me." Clearly Darcy had hit the soulmate jackpot. Maybe it was karma for something terrible she had done in a past life. Nothing else could explain getting not just one, but two, jerks as her soulmates.Jane and other friends had tried to come up with scenarios wh
