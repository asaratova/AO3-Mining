Chapter 1: Mjolnir
    




Chapter Text
Midoriya’s heart jumped into his throat as he asked the question. “Can someone like me...”He shook, but suppressed the quivering in his fingers. This was his chance. His chance to ask his Hero.“Without a Quirk...”Midoriya pressed his eyes shut, unable to look at the Symbol of Peace. “Be A Hero...?”----The scene ran through Midoriya Izuku’s mind again and again as he ran through the city streets, burnt notebook in hand. He sniffed hard in an effort to stop the tears that were already flowing and allowed his legs to carry him to through the streets until he didn’t recognize where he was anymore. He didn't know how long he had been running, and at this point, he didn't care.“No.”He’d finally heard confirmation from his Hero himself.“You can’t be a Hero.” Someone like Deku...Quirkless and powerless, could never be a Hero. “I guess when All Might tells you, that’s really all there is to it,” Midoriya choked, not watching where he was going. In fact, his legs carried him without thinking until he was off the sidewalks, off the roadways, and a decent way from civilization. As he wiped his eyes and caught his breath, he looked around and realized he didn’t recognize where he was, or how he came to be surrounded by trees. “There’s not a forest around here... is there?” He asked to no one in particular. He was met with silence at the inquiry, and Deku looked around for any signs of life.“Hello?” He called into the woods. A few animals skittered and rustled the leaves around him, but there was no answer. However, in the distance, he could see a light from a clearing. “Maybe that’s where I came in from...”Deku wandered through a thin, beaten path towards the light, a little embarrassed that he had allowed himself to lose track of time and even his location in his breakdown. But as he approached, he realized that this clearing wasn’t civilization. No, he had come across a small pond. In the middle of the pond, there was a rock of sorts jutting up from the water, perfectly centered and surrounded by the tall trees of the forest. There, sitting on the rock, was a large hammer of sorts. It was a simple hammer; a rectangular block of some sort of metal, the wooden handle pointing straight up into the sky. In any other circumstance, Midoriya would have felt disappointed, perhaps even fearful that he was lost. Not today.For some reason, that hammer was calling out to him. Not vocally, of course, but something in Deku’s chest made his heart flutter. His mind went numb, filled with nothing but a desire to get that hammer. Thoughtlessly, he began wading through the waist-deep water, not minding that he was getting his school uniform dirty, not minding as the bottom of his backpack skimmed the surface. Midoriya Izuku climbed the rock  with ease and looked down at the rather intimidating weapon. He grabbed the handle, expecting the hammer to feel heavy, but to his shock, he lifted it easily, holding it up to eye-level with one hand. “Is this a prop or something?” He wondered, aloud. He ran a finger over the surface of the hammer which confirmed that it was indeed a solid, metal hammer. It was then that a bolt of lightning came crashing from the crystal clear blue sky and struck the young man dead in the chest. Afterwards, Midoriya was gone. Gone, but not dead. He blinked a few times and gasped. No longer in the mysterious woods, Midoriya found himself in a mysterious hall that stretched taller than any building, stained glass windows  all around him. The hall itself was empty, save for one man sitting on a throne at the back of it. The man was far different from any Midoriya had met before; he looked like something out of viking folklore with a winged helmet, a braided beard, and long blonde hair that was beginning to turn gray. He had a metallic eyepatch covering his right eye, and his face was rugged and scarred from many battles. However, at Midoriya’s appearance, the viking looked down at the boy and gave a broad grin. “Ah! It appears Mjolnir has finally found someone worthy!” “Wh-what?!” Midoriya exclaimed. “T-this is a joke, right? Where am I?” The viking stood up. “I’m not one for jokes. I’ve got a rabbit friend, him and his tree are good at jokes. But you boy? This is no jest. For you are worthy! You are no longer Midoriya Izuku!”“I’m... not?” Midoriya asked. The viking descended the stairs and shrugged. “Well, I mean, no, you’re still Midoriya Izuku, but not just that! You have inherited my title! You are the GOD OF THUNDER!” At this, the clapping of thunder was heard outside of the stained glass windows, louder than Midoriya had ever heard it before. The throne room itself shook at the announcement. He flinched, and that’s when he saw it; he had, indeed changed. Holding the hammer, Midoriya’s body no longer looked like his one. Even under his school uniform, his lanky body had morphed into a muscular form. Not outlandish, but a body that could only be secured by, say, if he had spe
