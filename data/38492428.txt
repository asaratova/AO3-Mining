Chapter 1





Chapter Text
The team was searching a four-story building. Each floor has two Avengers checking every room for the bad guy, Hex.
You and Peter are on the third floor. You two got separated when the hall split into two different ways.
You were fine being on your own. You had done things on your own before, it wasn’t new to you. But for some reason fear was creeping into your mind and you couldn’t push it from your thoughts. It started when you didn’t meet back up with Peter. You turned the last corner and expected to see him, but he wasn’t there.

This floor is a huge square. Where is he?

“Peter?” you said.
No answer.
You tried to shake off the fear you were feeling, but it just wouldn’t leave. You also noticed that your comm wasn’t working.
“Hello? Peter? Cap?”
No answer again.

I don’t like this.

Finally, you turned a corner and ran into Peter. “Peter! I can’t hear anyone.”
“Me either.”
“… I’m scared…” You wouldn’t have admitted that to anyone else. Well, maybe Bucky, but that’s it.
He stopped, looking around and looked at you. “It’s okay, we’ll be okay.”
You both walked into the next room.
“Clear.”
As you two were walking out, a bunch of people came into the room. You and Peter stood back-to-back in the middle of the room. They lunged at Peter and you. You both started fighting, knocking a couple of them out. You eventually got separated a bit from each other.
Then someone grabbed you, trapping your arms to your sides.
“Peter!” Your brain froze and you couldn’t remember how to get out of the hold.
“Get your hands off her!”
While Peter was distracted, they grabbed him too and quickly chloroformed him.
You panicked, “Peter! No, stop!”
They chloroformed you as well and you slowly blacked out.
