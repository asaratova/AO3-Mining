Chapter Text
                                                    There’s nothing worse than a blinking cursor on a blank word document.And MJ’s been staring at it for the last hour at least.
Fucking writer’s block.
Although, it’s worth noting, she never really stood a chance. Not when she’s been handed this week’s puff piece.She has zero interest in the new fad diet that’s sweeping the upper echelons of the rich and famous (read: gullible, desperate, image obsessed) socialites of the Upper East Side. Just typing it into the google search bar and looking at the images of the luminescent shakes is bringing her out in hives and turning her stomach.She’s this close to dry heaving into the waste paper basket by her desk.Apparently, it’s a slow news week.Doesn’t help either that Nerd and Nerdier sitting on the other side of the office are currently lobbing jelly beans at each other and trying to catch them in their wide-open traps and making a ruckus with their laughter and jabbering.You know those guys? Those guys that never really grow out of high school, and seem perpetually sixteen, with the mindset, the fashion sense, and the social awkwardness to go along with it? Yeah, Ned Leeds and Peter Parker have nothing on them.Hell, she knows she’s one to talk. She’s not exactly Miss Social Butterfly either, but come on, jelly beans?Rubbing at her temples in frustration, and blowing away the loose curls hindering her vision, MJ peels off a bright pink post-it from her impressive stack and scrunches it into a ball. She sifts under the piles of papers and folders on her desk – yes, it’s a mess, everything in her life is, so what? – until her fingertips find what she’s looking for, and bingo! A mangy looking brown rubber band that’s seen better days.It’ll do.She fashions a catapult with practiced ease and launches her paper missile in the direction of NY Pulse’s resident science and tech staff writer and his photographer slash current affairs writer best friend. Her angling skewers slightly right this time and hits the former smack bang on the side of his head.“Hey!” Leeds exclaims, swivelling on his desk chair to look across the room at her. “What was that for?”And he asks it in that beleaguered manner which says this isn’t the first time she’s done this.And just like all those times before, MJ gives him a non-answer.“Everything.”“What?” he mouths, confused.She says nothing more, spins instead in her own seat, leans back, and lifts her feet up onto her desk. Well, on top of the old print issues of the Daily Bugle she’d been asked to unarchive for its upcoming 50th anniversary. Because, of course, they’re gonna have to blow smoke up the ass of the granddaddy of their publishing house. Joy.Not for the hundredth time MJ wonders why she’s still here. Doing this job.For one thing: she needs the money, of course.And the other? She’s not sure, but there’s a comfort in walking through the revolving glass doors of the Goodman Building, with its ornate brass railings and the deep mahogany wood panelling, every morning at 7.30am. Seeing Bill sitting behind the security desk, permanently with his hat slightly askew, a mega-watt smile on his face without fail as he says, “good morning Miss Jones” in that deep Brooklyn accent of his, always puts one on her own. He’s pushing sixty, she’s sure, and knows he can’t run for shit anymore with his angina, but he’s an institution, and the powers that be know they’d have a lawsuit on their hands if they ever tried to get rid of him. There’s also something about the daily trek up to the twenty third floor, and the ping of the elevator doors opening on the trés modern steel lettering of NY Pulse against the red, blue and grey acrylic panelling that makes her think she’s exactly where she’s supposed to be.Peter Parker’s bright smile when he stumbles into the office half an hour late every day has nothing to do with it. At all.She never smiles back.Aggravatingly, that doesn’t deter him in the least.He’s the newbie.Has been for the last six months and will be until a new fresh-faced wannabe editor-in-chief-in-the-making comes stumbling through the doors, only to learn it’s a pipe dream that’s never gonna happen, because Jameson, the stubborn bastard, will find a way to outlive them all. Of that, MJ has no doubt.The point is – he’s still bright eyed and bushy-tailed and eager to make friends.Not that he had to try very hard.Apparently, he and Leeds go way back to high school – which explains a hell of a lot – and even if you discount him, Harrington worships the ground he walks on. Because, somehow, the nerd managed to get an exclusive with one Spider-Man – high res photos and everything – as his first. freakin’. piece.MJ’s still none the wiser how he managed that, especially when sightings of New York’s resident friendly neighbourhood superhero have been in short supply in recent months. She’s never been on the Spider-Man train, actually couldn’t c
