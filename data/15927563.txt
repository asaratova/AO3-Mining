 Two weeks after Tony Stark died, there’s a knock on May Parker’s door.When she answers, there’s an unfamiliar man in a gray suit so bland he could only be a lawyer.He gives her a small smile and says, “Ma’am, I’m here to discuss Tony Stark’s will.”She slams the door in his face. He comes back half an hour later, armed with coffee, pastries, and Pepper Potts.“May,” Pepper greets warmly, a pained smile on her pale face. Her makeup is flawless and May feels guilty about the mascara tracks down her cheeks.“Pepper,” she says, wiping at her face. “Come in.”She calls Peter from his room, and knows by the look of dread on his face that he’s been listening in.They settle in the living room, Pepper graciously dispersing the high-end baked goods on May’s chipped plates without any hesitation or distaste in her features. She hands Peter a raspberry Danish, his favorite, without asking what he wants, and May softens towards this intrusion. It’ll hurt, but it hurts Pepper, too, so she can’t complain.The lawyer introduces himself as Robert Sharp, gets the formal jargon over with, and then turns to Peter.“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Peter,” he says, and he sounds sincere. “Mr. Stark talked about you often.”Peter nods shyly, burrows further into May’s side. She holds his hand and resists the urge to kick the lawyer out again. Couldn’t Pepper just tell them? It would be so much better from her.“As such, he has several benefits for you listed in his will. First, a college fund set up in your name, sufficient to cover eight years at any college of your choice. Second, this collection of brochures to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.” Peter snorts into May’s shoulder, reaching out and taking the stack of glossy MIT handouts Mr. Sharp had pulled out of his bag. Pepper’s lips twitch into a smile.“Third,” Mr. Sharp continues, “twenty-five percent of Mr. Stark’s shares to Stark Industries. He has noted here that his stock portfolio managers will continue to handle these until you are twenty-one. Fourth, he has named you the director of the September Foundation, and all associated charities and scholarship funds. This is a position that you will take up at the age of twenty-five. I have quite a lot of literature and directions written up for you at my office, I’ll make sure you get them.”Peter’s practically hyperventilating now. His eyes are so full of tears, May is sure he can’t see.Robert hesitates, looking at Pepper for a moment. Her own eyes are a little glassy, but she nods for him to continue.“Fifth, all the Iron Man suits that have not already been donated, as well as all the land, facilities, and materials associated with the team known as the Avengers. Again, these are to be claimed at the age of twenty-five, unless, and I’m quoting here, ‘unless he has need of them sooner, but he better not have need of them sooner.’”Peter sobs. He buries his face in his hands, his shoulders shuddering. May rubs his back.“Are we done?” she asks.“Not quite,” Robert says, looking apologetic. “The last items listed for Peter are… DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers. There’s no explanation, but I’m sure Mr. Parker knows what he means.”Peter sniffs, nodding.“Great.” May stands, ready to shoo Robert the Lawyer out the door so she can comfort her mourning nephew. “Now that that’s all taken care of…”“Actually, Mrs. Parker, you’re listed as a beneficiary as well.”She sits. Mostly because she’s lost feeling in her legs. “I’m in there?”Robert nods. Pepper smiles patiently.“Ok, well… read on, then,” she waves a hand at him, feeling sick to her stomach. She doesn’t want anything. She doesn’t want to benefit from Tony’s death.“Alright. To May Parker, the amount thirteen years of school in New York City costs.” May blinks at Robert the Lawyer, then at Pepper who’s mouth is pursed in a thin line to keep from crying, then back to Robert.“What?” She asks, her face flushing.“There’s a note he requested I give you upon reading that,” Robert adds, digging once again in his bag. It’s just a little slip of paper, with Tony’s handwriting on it, familiar from notes about picking up Peter, or dropping off Peter’s backpack when he forgot it at Tony’s.
I know Peter isn’t my son, but he’s as good as. If I had met him as a child I would have insisted on paying for his schooling—taking care of a genius is no cheap task. You’ve done so much for him, May. Let me do this much for you.
May clenches her jaw, pulls Peter a little closer to her.“What if I don’t want it?” May blurts out. She doesn’t want any of it, knows Peter doesn’t either. They would turn down every cent if they could have Tony back.Mr. Sharp smiles. “Mr. Stark was very careful. The money has already been moved into your account. You can choose to not use it, I suppose, but it is yours.”There are a few more technicalities they suffer through, paperwork and things they’ll have to fill out at some point. Then Pepper is wadding up the trash from their, mostly abandoned, treats and taking it to the
