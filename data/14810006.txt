Chapter 1: One
    




Chapter Text
Tony Stark dies alone in a Siberian bunker. FRIDAY sent distress calls to James Rhodes, Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan and the Vision - but it's not enough.The Crown Prince of Asgard personally leads the Warriors Three in a rescue mission - only to be greeted by the dull eyes of a friend and a familiar murder weapon. Eventually whispers spread across the globe: The King is Dead...Long Live the Queen.  
 The world's press gather around the remains of the Starks' Malibu house, waiting for the conference to begin. Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan and James Rhodes stand (though in Rhodes' case sit) to the side, slightly elevated from the throng. All three of them look like wrecks of their former selves. The Vision hovers opposite them - emotions that were once foreign to him write clear across his face. (if anyone notices the Christine Everhart's eyes are a touch red, they do not say anything)Everyone waits for the conference to begin, wondering why Potts does not step forward.Thunder rumbles across the sky and a stream of energy directs itself behind the podium, and when it fades away Honey Stark is revealed. Her red hair is a riot and her pale skin looks even paler in the black Asgardian silk that she's dressed in. Pietro Maximoff stands on her right and Prince Thor stands on her left - with the Warriors Three and Lady Sif behind them.(nobody misses how even the Asgardians are dressed in black - the court of Asgard is in mourning)The new owner of Stark Industries stepped up to the podium - the men stepped off to the side. Pale hands shake as they are placed on the podium. "I thank you all for coming today." Honey begins, the wind around them dying away with her words, "I am sure you are all concerned for the future of Stark Industries after this tragedy." "My father was...murdered and his body abandoned in a Siberian bunker over a week ago now. I am sure you will all recognise the murder weapon." Whispers pick up as Fandrall (for once as grim as Hogun) holds up a familiar red, white and blue shield. "Why Captain America felt the need to go to such extreme measures is...unknown. But I would like it made clear now: Stark Industries will continue to support the Sokovia Accords - as my father did - and will fight to ensure for the terrorist faction commonly known as 'Team Cap' to receive the full extent of the law for their crimes." 
 The videos leak nearly two weeks later.
