At the moment, he preferred robots over a living crew, especially since his last crew tried to kill him and take over the ship. Since ending up in this area of the universe, Harry had tried to make the best of the situation. Who knew that when his and Voldemort’s streams crossed, the power would create a wormhole of unspeakable power. When Harry forced the wormhole back to Voldemort’s wand, the crazy bastard was ripped apart. Unfortunately, it began to grow and grow and Harry was unable to get away fast enough. He was pulled through and ended up on some backwater planet on the galactic rim. Since then, he had been trying his best to make a new life for himself. It wasn’t long before he realized that there was very little chance of him ever getting home. Wherever he was, it was almost nothing like home. The technology was out of this world. The one thing that had gotten him super excited was the space ships. As a kid, he had always dreamed of traveling throughout space. Now, his dream was within his grasp. The one major downer was that he was unlikely to ever see his friends again. He was able to take solace in the fact that he had done his duty and finished off Voldemort. His friends could grow up and not have to worry about that. Being stuck in such a foreign place was difficult at first. He didn’t speak any of the languages or have any money. Thankfully, his magic was stronger than it ever had been. This had given him the upper hand when trying to make something of himself. Harry robbed, cheated, and stole until he was able to afford a protocol droid that quickly learned English and then began teaching him Galactic Basic. Harry continued to amass credits until he was finally able to buy a decent, used ship. His ship, The Gryffindor was an Allanar N3 light freighter. It wasn’t sexy, but he liked it nonetheless. He had quickly noticed that few ships actually looked cool in this place. There were a few exceptions, like the ships built by the Nabooans. There was no way that he could afford one of those. They were built for luxury. His ship was built to haul cargo, which he did. He did it well. Smuggling was a lucrative business for Harry. With his magic, he was able to give his ship some upgrades, like some expanded space to hide stuff in, and the ability to make the ship invisible and silent for short periods of time. He was hesitant about adding too much magic to a ship that flung him through space faster than the speed of light. His business had led him to Felucia to pick up a hefty amount of Nysillin that one of his associates had procured without paying for. He needed Harry to load it and get out quickly since the Republic was beginning to snoop around the planet. Picking up the contraband wasn’t difficult with his ability to go invisible. He had enough time to approach the planet and land before needing to recharge the ward, which was just what he did. While some droids loaded up his ship with the valuable crop, Harry spent the next twenty minutes charging the ward so that he could go invisible on takeoff. Once the ship was recharged and loaded with his stolen goods, Harry fired up the three sub-light engines and went invisible before taking off.“Seeing anything good?” Harry asked his droid that was manning the scanning station. “A group of Clone Troopers not far from here. The waypoint has been uploaded to your map, Captain.” Harry nodded and decided to check it out. He still wasn’t sure what the Republic wanted with a planet in the Outer Rim.  As he skimmed over the vast forests of flower trees, he suddenly saw the group of Republic clone troops surrounding a blue being. Invisible and silent, Harry hovered over the group until they began firing on her. Harry could see the fear and look of betrayal on her face as she was lit up. His eyes widened as they peppered her with blaster fire. Taking aim, Harry used his laser cannons to decimate the group of clones. With every shot fired, another clone was ripped in half or ragdolled through the air, never to get up again. With everyone dead, he quickly landed and scooped the female up from the middle of all the destruction. Placing a Stasis Charm on her, Harry knew that it wouldn’t last long. Hopping in the seat, he took off just as a Republic warship could be seen in the distance, making its way to the disturbance. They had no chance of finding him while he was unseen. Even so, Harry didn’t beat around the bush. He left the atmosphere as fast as humanly possible. His invisibility would only last another half hour or so. Once they had reached the edge of Felucia’s gravity well, he told his navigator droid to take them to the meeting spot. As the hyperdrive kicked on, Har
