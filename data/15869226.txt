Harry lay, unconscious, on the floor of his tiny bedroom.
Vernon had been on a terrible mood when he came back from work. Not that it was out of the ordinary, but with Aunt Petunia and Dudley out for an appointment, Harry found himself on the wrong place at the wrong time. It had come out of nowhere. Harry had just finished his chores for the day and was just reaching the top of the stairs, looking down, not really paying attention to anything around him. So when Vernon opened the door, he took off after Harry as soon as he saw him.
The first hit went straight to the head.
"YOU!! It's all because of you!!!. Who do those freaks think they are?! I know they are making my work difficult with their freakishness! ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!!"
For someone the size of a baby Hippo, Vernon Dursley could move quite fast and be quite strong. Everything was so sudden that Harry had no chance of protecting himself. Hit after hit, he found himself in the middle of his bedroom, in a fetal position, taking all of Vernon's rage.
One particular kick to the middle of his back knock out all of the air on Harry's lungs. What little determination he had to stay silent and just take the abuse was gone with the piercing pain from the hit. A loud wail broke out of his throat. He started shaking so bad, his back arched in an unnatural position, spasms ripping through him as if he was having some sort of seizure. This seemed too pissed Vernon even more, as he keeps kicking Harry, faster and with even more determination to make him scream.
"Do you really think I am done with you? You will pay!! For everything!! Do you hear me FREAK?!!!"
Harry lost consciousness. Between the pain, his screams, the number of kicks to his abused body and the terrible sense of helplessness, Harry actually welcomed the pitch black that soon claimed him.

Queens, New York
 
Peter Parker was swinging his way through Queens on his way home. It had been a rather uneventful afternoon and he was looking forward to the weekend he was to spend with none other than Tony FREAKING Stark!, on the Avengers Compound!. He just needed to pick up a couple of things and a quick change. Happy was set to pick him up in about an hour so, that gave him enough time.
Tony Stark, on the other hand, was also looking forward to the weekend with the kid. He still couldn't believe how fast the kid had wormed his way into Tony's life. He was silly, talkative to a point of being annoying sometimes and funny as heck without even doing it on purpose. All in all, it was endearing and cute. Of course, he would never admit this to anyone. Ever.
He decided to surprise the kid by going with Happy to pick him up. The plans for the weekend were the usual, working on the lab, eating take out, watching a couple of movies and just spending time with the kid. A quick trip to the beach was also on the plans for Tony, but a total surprise for Peter. He wondered if Peter would like it. Sometimes he got the hint that the kid wasn't that fond of big bodies of water, but Tony hadn't got the nerve to ask directly. He really hoped Peter would like it, but if not, he had a few contingency plans ready. After all, you don't necessarily need to get in the water to enjoy the beach, right?
Happy and Tony made it to the apartment building just in time to see an overexcited Peter come down the stairs and look up and down the street before spotting the pristine Audi.
"Hey Happy, I am sorry if i am a little l... Mr. Stark!!! Oh, hey! What are you doing here?"
"Hey kiddie. What, not happy to see me? Here I thought you'll be all over the moon! You are hurting my feelings Spider-baby."
"No! Sorry, Mr. Stark. I just wasn't expecting to see you here. Please don't take it personally. You know I would never..."
"Don't sweat it, kid. I was just messing with you. Jeez, after all this time..."
"Oh. Mmmm... ok. And Mr. Stark, sir? I am not a baby."
"Hahahaha!!! Oh, come on Spider-baby. Tell you what, I'll stop calling you that if you start calling me Tony. How about that? Do we have a deal?"
"But?!"
"Nuhu. Nope. Not negotiable. It is a yes or a no. Decide."
"Ok Mr. St... Tony. You win."
"That's my boy! Go on Happy! We have a busy weekend ahead of us."
Peter didn't know how to describe the feeling in his chest at the moment. This warm, peaceful but at the same time exciting feeling. He felt happy, content with the idea that he was now on a first-name basis with Tony Stark, and that while he didn't say it out loud to everyone, he had come to see Tony as the father figure he was missing since Ben's death.
The ride to the compound was nice, in comfortable silence. While Tony went through some emails on his phone he asked Peter about school, his friends and May. Peter answer everything as truth
