Chapter Text

“Sound the bugle now - Play it just for me. As the seasons change - Remember how I used to be. Now I can't go on - I can't even start. I've got nothing left - just an empty heart. I'm a soldier - wounded so I must give up the fight. There's nothing more for me - lead me away...Or leave me lying here. Sound the bugle now - Tell them I don't care. There's not a road I know - That leads to anywhere. Without a light, I fear that I will - Stumble in the dark. Lay right down - Decide not to go on. Then from on high - Somewhere in the distance. There's a voice that calls - Remember who you are. If you lose yourself - your courage soon will follow. So be strong tonight - Remember who you are. You're a soldier now - fighting in a battle. To be free once more - That's worth fighting for.” - Bryan Adams 
 

I can’t see.


The air was thick with smoke and ash, that filled his lungs and left a bitter taste in his mouth. Tony slid out of the car and stumbled across the rocky debris as bullets flew around him and grenades sent explosions of sand and stones through the air. The members of his security team were yelling, but it was a distant background noise, that faded as they each jerked to the ground in spurts of red.

Tony dove for the biggest rock in sight, his hands skidding across the gravel. Shaking, he whipped out his phone to call for help. He had barely written out three words when a small missile landed not two feet away from him emitting a shrill hissing noise. Tony hazily registered the name STARK written on its side before it exploded in a blast of heat and shrapnel, sending him flying. 

His back hit the ground with a thud, stars exploding across his eyes. His ears were ringing, all other sound merely a muted echo, and his face and hands burned with hundreds of cuts. Tony let out a whimper as a sharp, excruciating pain spread through his chest. Glancing down, he saw dark red pools of blood quickly seeping into his once pristine shirt. Pawing at the buttons, his fingers skid underneath his shirt feeling the once impenetrable bullet proof vest, now shredded and torn- along with his body underneath it.
 
His last thought was that there was no one with him as he died. He was alone. Always alone.

Tony nervously tugged at his shirt his, palms slightly damp. This would be the first time he saw his father since he had come home three weeks earlier. So far, despite living in the same house, their paths had not crossed, but Tony wasn’t surprised. He knew why his father had been avoiding him. 



Tony had gotten his classification exam results back and they were, in Howard’s words ‘an abomination’.  



‘Anything but a 


little


 would have been bearable!” he had spat, disgust showing plainly on his face before he stormed out, the letter crumpled on the floor. 



The words had haunted him for days, constantly circling his every thought. Jarvis had told him not to worry, that being 
a
 little didn't change who he was, but Tony knew better. Being a little changed everything. 



He knocked on his father’s office door. After a muffled bark of ‘enter!’ he slowly turned the knob. 



Howard Stark sat at his desk, stacks of papers blanketing the surface. Tony glanced nervously at him, then ducked his head down quickly. His father’s cold eyes bore into him like nails, his silence all encompassing. Even at the age of fifteen, he still had a way of making Tony feel about a foot tall. 



Tony took a gulp of breath before starting, “D-dad I-”



“Quiet.” Howard interrupted sharply.“Do you know why I had you? So that a real man could take over Stark Industries, so that I could die knowing that a Stark would be there to fill my shoes, and look at the mess you’ve created now Tony. I can’t have a child take over my company, much less a 


baby


!” His voice rose to a yell by the end of it, as he stood to tower over Tony’s slight frame. He had always been small for his age and now they knew why. 



Tony flinched back, hunching his shoulders around his ears, his father's words feeling like a physical blow. 



“Weren’t you enough of a disappointment already?!” Howard went on, ignoring his sons signs of distress. “Answer me damn it!” His father banged his fist on his desk, grabbing Tony’s chin roughly in one hand and forcing him to look up. His fingers dug into the skin with a pressure that was sure to leave bruises.



Tony's tongue felt like it was glued to the roof of his mouth. His throat closed too tight to speak. 



“Useless. Utterly useless. Get out, Tony.” his father waved a hand at him like he was a pesky fly, going back to filling out paperwork, at once dismissing his son from his office and his life.



Tony walked out on trembling legs, his mind numb. He didn't realize where he his feet were taking him until he entered his bedroom and fell onto the bed, curling i
