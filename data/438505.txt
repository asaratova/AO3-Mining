Chapter 1





Chapter Text
"Far be it for me to be the one to call for an end to the petty bickering, but the last time we had a five-way argument the Hulk gutted two levels of the 'carrier."The silence that follows Tony's statement was in no way comfortable; rising pheremones and three days spent in completely pointless quarantine have everyone irritable. A briefing now, four Alphas stuck in a room (and waiting on a fifth, damnit), with only a non-dynamic alien and a single Beta to buffer them, is only making it worse."You think that's going to help?" Bruce says, the calm in his voice forced.Tony's gaze flickers up from his Starkpad to meet Bruce's for a moment.  "I think the Hulk just plain angry is destructive enough.  Hulk in a territorial rage?"  He shakes his head.  "New York City has the third largest population of Alphas in the United States.  It's number one in terms of population density.  The only thing that is going to stop two weeks of riots is to send every Alpha who can get out of the city out.  I've already approved temporary transfers or emergency leave for every SI employee based in New York who requests it, no questions asked.  We need buffer units from the National Guard here, we need some way of scrubbing the air every six to eight hours - Ororo Munroe might be able to help, but that will only help out of doors.""That's a worst-case scenario, Mr. Stark," Agent Coulson says mildly.  "And a pretty extreme one at that.""You think so?  You're a Beta," and the word comes out too clipped to be a snarl, but the emotion behind it is the same.  "There's four Alphas in this room alone, we live together, play together, work together, fight together, we've taken bullets and God knows what else to protect each other and we're all one wrong word from trying to claw each other to pieces and it's only been four days.  The worst of it won't hit for another week."  The Starkpad clatters to the tabletop.  "What you fail to take into account is that the suppressants don't just block pheromones - they block the responses to those pheromones in other people.""And you really think this is going to help?"  Natasha's half out of her chair, muscles tense for battle."Sit."  Tony pushes, just a little, just enough to see her slowly sinking back into her chair.  Not enough to blow his cover.  "There's no hotspots other than New York big enough to require the Avengers' attention.  Don't give me that look, Coulson, you know it's true."  He waits a beat for a response, a second, and continues when there isn't one.  "The only attention  the public needs right now from us is strategic, and I already told you:  scatter the affected Alpha population as much as possible.  Increase the number of unaffected Betas and off-cycle Omegas as much as you possibly can, as fast as you can.  Scrub the damn pheromones out of the air.  Sending five more Alphas into a city ready to blow--son of a bitch.""Tony?"  Steve's laser focused now, the anger no longer directionless and trapped behind clenched teeth, and Tony knows it's because the last time he heard that exact phrase, spoken in that tone, they wound up racing back to New York and a monument built to the sky."Not now, damnit," he mutters, hands shaking, fumbling for his Starkphone."Mr. Stark, this is hardly the time--"Tony jerks his head up and glares, fingers stilled and white-knuckled around his phone.  "We live together and play together and fight together and five Alphas would rip each other to shreds without more of a buffer than one Beta and an alien.""Miss Potts is an Omega--""Who's gone far more often than she's there.  Let me make this easy on you."  Tony breathes deep, bracing himself for the loss of secrecy, of privacy, instinct already screaming at him to protect, to shelter, knowing his Omega - his Omega, claimed but unknowing - was suffering.  "This is my team, Coulson, mine.  If Fury wants it back he can damn well fight me for it."  And with that, he drops every bit of shielding he's built over a quarter century, every barrier, and pushes.He can see the flinching, the shocked disbelief at the truth of his dynamic, but no one tries to stop him as he turns back to his phone.
