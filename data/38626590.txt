It took Thor maybe ten seconds to lose you.
“Asgard!”
This was the last word he heard: a joyful shout at finally being able to see his home realm. He smiled, threw back his head to laugh at your contagious excitement, and when he looked back again, you were gone.
“[Name]?” he asked as he walked through the halls of the royal palace.
How did one Midgardian move so quickly? It should be apparent enough that you weren’t an intruder, so Thor wasn’t much worried about someone attacking you. Still, bilgesnipes were a problem around that time of year. Besides that, Thor had been planning on this whole trip being a bit more romantic than you ditching him first chance you got.
Then your head popped around a corner.
“Come on, slowpoke!” you cried. “We have a lot to see!”
Leery about losing you again, Thor only smiled as he laughed this time before he walked over to take your hand.
 “What’s the rush?“ he asked. "We have all the time in the Nine Realms.”
