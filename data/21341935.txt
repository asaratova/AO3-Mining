Chapter Text


2005.

Tony received the phone call during an evening in Vegas.His hands were warm, frantically fleeting between a drink and the waists of women to his left and right. Each spoke softly in his ear, gentle voices carrying incoherent words, meanwhile Tony thought about a nice, hot rotisserie chicken. He could picture its golden-brown skin smeared in a hickory barbecue sauce as the delectable flavors danced on his tongue. His stomach growled, and he hummed in satisfaction.“Okay,” he announced, “fuck this game. It’s rigged anyway. Who’s hungry?” Tony clapped his hands together, and a chorus of cheers followed. His cheeks ached from the grin stretching on his skin–– it was the kind of smile that felt good for a matter of time, but once that façade crumbled, its meaning washed away.A large hand grabbed his shoulder. “Tony.”The billionaire turned, yelling out a curt, “hey!” as colors and shapes spun around him. In a matter of seconds, a man had formed before Tony’s eyes. “Hap–– Happy! Hey, hey, you’re lookin’ pretty t’night, baby.”“Tony,” Happy repeated, tone firm and professional. “Phone call for you.”“Phone call?” Tony patted the guard’s shoulder. “I’m on vacay, buddy. No phone calls tonight.”Happy shook his head. “I think you should take this one.”The call was quick. Tony, in his lighthearted, drunken stupor, hardly thought much about it. The influx of information overwhelmed his brain, and the chicken scratches on his hotel notepad were unintelligible. An address, a few names, and the unfortunate news that Mary and Richard Parker had died–– whoever the hell they were.“Do you remember anyone named Mary?” asked Tony. His stomach swirled with the side effects of the call, plus the aftermath of drinking until he forgot his middle name. The hotel chair was rough beneath his pants, a sensation that made it hard to sit still.“No,” said Happy. He stood in the corner with his hands clasped in front of him. It looked as though he was waiting for something to happen. “Should I?”“Nope.” Tony glanced at the notepad again. He wanted to make sure he had his information right. “Apparently, I should, though. Got a son with her.”Happy huffed a quick laugh. “You have a son with a hundred other women. All have accused you of bolting at the news. What’s so different about this one?”Tony sniffed, mouth curling while he tapped the pen against the tabletop. “She’s dead,” he said, but his voice was void of emotion. “Killed in a plane crash with her husband.”“Shit,” Happy muttered.“Yeah, shit, exactly.” Tony rubbed at his forehead, and he tried not to let the rhythmic pulsations in his temples distract from the matter at hand. He felt sick to his stomach–– certainly, the amount of alcohol he had consumed was not helping his case, and he wished he was back home in his workshop.“Does the kid have any other family?” asked Happy. “Maybe we can––““I don’t fucking know anything about this goddamn kid, Happy!” Tony snapped suddenly, his hands balling into fists against the laminate wood while the silence settled in. “Sorry–– sorry, Hap. It’s just–– it’s just a lotta information right now. Got a meet with some agency. Don’t even know if I get to meet the kid. Doesn’t really matter anyway.”“Maybe it’s not even yours.”Tony sighed. “Can’t be so sure about that one,” he mumbled. “Somehow, I signed the birth certificate. Pack your bags, Harold. We fly to New York in the morning.”–––Tony couldn’t sleep that night, nor on the plane ride the next day. The carefree side of him believed it would all blow over soon, that it was all a miscommunication and that the agency had gotten their facts wrong. But another part of him trusted the gut feeling that flooded over in waves of nausea. The clouds below were blinding white streaks in his vision.He neglected Happy’s advice to not wallow in the details. Happy hadn’t heard the solemn tone of the man’s voice on the phone. He hadn’t heard each name listed–– hadn’t heard that the poor kid was only four years old. A little boy named Peter who lived in Queens, who now didn’t have parents, who now had to live the rest of his life desperately trying to not forget their memory. Tony knew a little bit about that.But he had also been an adult when his parents died. Peter was only four.“You can just deny all of this, Tony,” said Happy after the long drive into Queens. “Just say you don’t wanna meet the thing. Say the kid’s not yours, and then we can go get a burger or something.”Tony was unable to answer.The halls of the agency were long and narrow–– the dark corridors only fueled his anxiety. He felt too expensive for the carpet beneath his feet. He felt like his clothes left a squeaky residue along every inch of the wooden-paneled walls.“Does it smell musty in here to you?” Tony asked, yet there was no answer. He imagined the hallway stretching longer and longer. He imagined the soles of shoes melting against the carpet’s synthetic fibers, a hot, toxic smoke rising with e
