Chapter 1: Discovered
    


Summary:

This mindset had been a part of him for as long as he could remember but mostly it went unfulfilled; how awkward it would be if General Ross was to finally catch up with him when he's suckling a pacifier. No, it was much safer to ignore the 'little' side of him until he knew he was safe. 
This fic will be getting weekly updates of new and rewritten chapters. 2021.



Notes:
Alright so your response over the last week when I asked whether or not I should continue was… overwhelming. I’ve had the shittiest year, like a lot of other people, but having such kind and excited words for something I wrote made tears come to my eyes. I wish I could give you all a massive hug. If anyone needs to hear this today: I appreciate you and hope you have a peaceful week. Thank you. 
Now I aim to repost one rewritten chapter weekly on a Friday but I’ll let you know if an update a certain week isn’t an option. So the fic is going to look a little strange with 22 chapters without any words in them but I couldn’t bring myself to delete them and lose all the lovely comments you’ve left me over the years. 
Please note that while each chapter is getting looked at and rewritten, it won’t be completely, so the first few (especially Chapters 1, 3 and 4) may be very similar to what was already there.

Chapter Text
After the Battle with the Chitauri, New York scrambled to achieve some sense of normalcy. The same can also be said for the Avengers. As the 'only name in clean energy right now', Tony oversaw the rebuild of the city along with the Tower. Part of the Tower's refurbishment was to give each Avenger a floor, thereby giving their ragtag group a place they could call home.
Steve took him up on his offer immediately as everywhere he was familiar with had completely changed. He was pretty sure that the owners of his building would not honour a 70 year old lease. Clint and Natasha used their floors whenever they were on leave from S.H.E.I.L.D, which wasn't all that often, for a little R&R. Thor was most grateful for his floor which, along with Bruce and Steve’s, had been made with reinforced everything due to his ability to put his fist clean through a door. The God, however, was not in the Tower for now as he had taken Loki back to Asgard to await his sentencing and punishment. Bruce hoped that the rest of the team would soon return so as to have everyone under one roof. While they weren’t necessarily close, Bruce enjoyed spending time in a busy home, and when everyone was in residence it certainly was that. 
Bruce couldn't believe his luck when he'd been shown his floor in the Tower; Tony had also given him a whole floor of R&D to research in to his hearts content. He had never had such luxury in his life. He attempted to protest but a little voice inside his head reminded him not to bite the hand that feeds you so, he thanked Tony and offered to cook for everyone a few nights a week as thanks.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gradually, Bruce was becoming more secure in his place at the Tower and within the team. Although it seemed like it would take a lot of work, everyone seemed to get along pretty well. Following a few weeks of awkward hellos and passing each other in the hallways, they slipped into a regular schedule of team dinners and movie nights. Of course they all had bad days along with their own ways of dealing with their demons; they all had their burdens and triggers. 
Clint and Natasha seemed content to lick their wounds alone. After a bad mission or a rough night, Clint would more often than not be found in the complex air duct systems that ran throughout their private floors; sometimes coming down for food or to just watch the world go by through the vent covers. Natasha was a little less solitary in her quiet moments of reflection; whether it was spending hours in the gym trying to hone her already perfected skills or curling up in the common room with a book, unless something catastrophic had happened she usually shunned her own company. 
Tony, often tortured with visions of sand and heat morphing into expansive nothingness and cold, would barricade himself in his lab for days. He would solder and hammer until he was sure that he couldn’t hear the screaming or the sound of rushing water anymore. After drinking, blasting music and creating some new piece of groundbreaking tech that would keep people safe, he would eventually be intercepted by Bruce or Steve who would drag him upstairs for food more substantial than a power bar, then he was sent to bed. 
Steve, being from the time that he was, would try to act as if nothing bothered him. The gentle giant always made sure everyone was well before he would even think about helping himself. It had been entirely by accident when one night Bruce had encountered Steve in the grip of
