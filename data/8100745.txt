Chapter Text
She's always been the more impatient one of the two of them, which really isn't saying much when Steve can't hold out much longer than she can, but he likes to try and be a little more decent about where they do this. Mostly because Tony still likes to remind them about how they broke the towel rack in his guest bathroom when he and Pepper had everyone over on New Year's, but whatever.That had been a really good New Year's."Fuck," he breathes against her lips, fingers flexing over her hips as she backs him into the kitchen table and kisses him harder. She curves her body against his as she pushes her fingers into his hair and tugs just enough to draw a groan from the back of his throat. He's already hard - she can feel it with how they're pressed together - and she knows it'll take nothing at all for what little self-control he has left to melt under her touch. Which is good, because she needs him right now and doesn't really feel like stumbling their way out of the kitchen and into one of the dozens of guest rooms the penthouse has."Thought of you all night," she murmurs into the kiss, scraping her fingernails lightly down his side over the thin material of his shirt. He shudders against her ever so slightly when she grazes the spot on his ribs where he's particularly sensitive and she nips at his lower lip, digs a little harder over that same spot."God, Nat." He pulls away a little all of a sudden and she lets out this little whimper, blinking up at him from under her eyelashes. He's probably seeing right through her little act right now, but fuck. It's not really an act at all. The fact that his lips are not on hers right this second is a little cruel. "Fuck," he mutters again, and the low, gravelly tone of his voice tells her that he's two seconds from forgetting that they're in a fairly public place where their friends could walk in on them in any second. Then he licks his lips a little, his fingers flexing over her hips again, and the little that's left of her patience completely dissolves as she shoves him down onto one of the chairs and throws her legs around his hips, sliding onto his lap.He pushes his fingers into her hair, bringing their lips back together, and then tugs reflexively when she grinds down on him. He moans, and she can feel the vibration of it with the way their chests are pressed together, and she loves it. She rolls her hips again, relishing in the little grunts coming from the back of his throat, at the way he pulls a little more at her hair, just enough for it to feel amazing. Then he flattens his other hand over the small of her back and presses her closer, presses her down harder, and she whimpers as she feels him pressing up against her through his jeans.Oh, god.It takes all she has to scoot herself away from the sensation of him brushing against her, but gives enough space for her to reach between them and start undoing the buckle of his belt. "Can't believe we're really doing this," he murmurs against her lips, but he doesn't sound even a little worried or reluctant. "You're so impatient," he says, but his breathy chuckle quickly dissolves into a groan when she pops the front of his jeans open and reaches under the waistband to grasp his length."What can I say?" she asks, stroking once and watching his head fall back as his eyelids flutter. She gnaws her lower lip - she'll never get tired of this picture - and then grasps the back of the chair with one hand for balance as she tugs her panties aside with her other, lowering just enough so that he's pressing against her entrance. Fuck, that feels so good. "You drive me crazy.""I know the feeling," he grunts, and then presses over the small of her back against, and she lets out this little yelp when he's pushed as deep inside of her as he can get in this position. Fuck, fuck. That feels even better, almost enough for her to not be pissed about him trying to turn the tables. She pinches his rib, making him jerk, which makes him press a little more against her, drawing a whimper. "What?" he asks, smirking at her like the perfect little shit he is. "You were taking too long,"She laughs. Now who's impatient?
