Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Jason Todd had never met anyone like Peter Parker. He had Deathstroke to thank for introducing them. Dick kept reminding him that he could have met Peter sooner, if only he attended the Wayne gala more often. Of all his brothers, Dick was the one who had known Peter for years, when he was still friends with Harry Osborn and attended galas with him. Jason wasn't the same as he was years ago and in a way he was glad Peter didn't know him back then, he was still a bit of a jerk when he wanted to draw attention to himself or wanted someone to notice him, but the experience had taught him not to judge or presuppose anything about anyone and to know how to value the company of those who decide to stay with him despite knowing him and knowing all the bad things he had done. That was how he knew he could count on them, that they wouldn't betray him. Those were the people of worth and throughout his life, they had been very few.That was why he was scared to attend the Wayne galas in Peter's company. Jason was not a very handsome man when it came to social skills. He was elusive, sullen, the complete opposite of Dick. He sometimes thought that Dick and Peter were made for each other. They were so alike that he sometimes wondered if Peter was dating the right brother. But he was more scared that Tony Stark would be present at the gala. His way of going after Peter like he was his father was something Jason didn't like, because Peter had told him that he felt uncomfortable when other people tried to mentor him and be a father figure of his life. Jason had to admit that Bruce was holding it in like a pro, it was barely noticeable that he also wanted to adopt Peter because of his tragic past, though Jason suspected it was because if he adopted Peter, he and Jason wouldn't be able to date, because it would be incest, something rare and completely illegal.Stark persisted despite being rebuffed. Perhaps Red Hood should have a talk with him about respecting privacy and tell him clearly what he thought of the gossip. He wouldn't mind doing it right now, but he didn't want to cause a scene. Jason looked at Bruce exasperated. He didn't want to ask him for help, but if he didn't and Stark harassed Peter again, he would be the one to intervene and what he was going to tell him would be anything but nice.- Mr. Stark.-said Peter seriously, looking into his eyes.-I don't want to join the Avengers, I don't want to be one of them, stop insisting and acting like my father. You are not. You're not my "daddy". I don't need or want one. I already had a father figure, his name was Ben Parker. When he died, it was Norman Osborn and Adrian Toomes who helped my Aunt May take care of me. Otto Octavius is also currently trying to be my father figure, although I see him more as an uncle. I don't know if you know, but my father is alive. His name is Jonathan Crane. I don't know why everyone wants to be my father, they aren't and it disgusts me that they try to curtail my rights, as if I was a baby. I am not a baby, nor a small child. I am a man capable of fighting supervillains and making my own decisions."You don't understand, boy, Todd is dangerous and you're dating him." Apparently Stark hadn't been paying attention to Peter. "I don't approve. He is dangerous.""I don't care if you approve or not." Peter answered. "Because it's not you who's going to fuck with Jason."Jason's eyes widened and he stared at Peter. He then sized up Stark. Because it was totally ridiculous for Jason to fuck with Stark while having Peter. First, because Stark had judged him without even knowing him, that had made him lose all interest in him. But the fact that Peter defended him excited him a lot. If they weren't out in public and had to keep up the front for Bruce, he'd kiss him right there."Get a grip, Jason. Now is not the time to cause a scene and be in all the papers tomorrow." He had to repeat himself for a long time to calm his growing erection. Peter stared at him, ignoring Stark. He kissed Jason as if he needed it to breathe, to live. Jason melted into the kiss. He never thought his little spider could be so passionate, but he wasn't going to protest. Peter cornered him between his body and the table where his family was. Jason could feel the light from the camera flashes. Peter quickly broke away, but stood beside him, one hand on Jason's waist, looking at Stark, daring him to come closer.And fuck, Peter was hot.- I already warned you, boy.-Stark said, before leaving, clearly disappointed.From the look on Bruce's face, he seemed to be just as surprised by Peter's character. Apparently his little spider had achieved what the villains of Gotham could not: take Batman off guard. Tim was flushed and Damian watched the scene with fascination. But of all, Dick was the most shocked. When they met him, they had thought Peter fragile, shy, too good for Gotham. They had been wrong about him and that was dangerous, because he could be hiding
