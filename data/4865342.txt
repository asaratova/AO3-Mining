Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Chapter 1It all happened so fast anyone would say. But not to her; not through her eyes.They always admired her acute sight in the red room; her ability to depict every detail no matter how rapid the sequence of movements could be.‘You have a gift, Natalia,’ they used to tell her. But her gift never felt more like a curse that in this exact moment.Natasha was on the ground, immobilized by the weight of metal bars squeezing the lower part of her body. She watched as Steve took over her brawl against the Winter Soldier. She tried to pull herself out of the metal trap while punches were thrown between the two former best friends who had now become enemies.Then she saw it. She clearly saw, and in every tiny detail, the Winter Soldier pull the gun out of his leather case and aim it at Steve who had his back to him. She saw his finger press the trigger without a hint of hesitation , the bullet spurt out of the barrel, cut through the air then finally lodge itself into her teammate’s abdomen before her aghast eyes.Steve staggered, one hand clutching his open wound, then slump onto the floor. The Winter Soldier didn’t bat an eyelid, shot a glance in her direction then walked out of the room in a mechanical gait.She turned her attention back to Steve who was now gasping penibly, his chest jerking with the rhythm of his muscle spasms.Natasha used all her strength to release her legs from the bars.'No, no, no, no,’ she whispered alarmingly to herself as she ran up to him as fast as possible.She swiftly fell to her knees and held his face.His flickering eyes fell on her and regained a spark.  He tried to speak but a faint stuttering came out of his mouth.She lifted her wrist to her mouth.'Cap is down! I repeat, Cap is down!’ she cried into her transmitter, breathing heavily. 'Requesting medical support urgently and immediate extraction.’Steve slightly shook his head in response to her S.O.S call.She slid her arm under his neck and lifted his upper body onto her lap. She pressed her hand on the bleeding wound, watching helplessly as the scarlet blood slipped between her fingers in profusion. She then glanced around the room for a piece of cloth close enough to her reach so she wouldn’t have to leave his side.'Hold on, Steve,’ she groaned forcefully, looking away so he wouldn’t see the anguish of being wrong in her eyes. 'Help is coming.’He shook his head again.'I-I never thought it would end like this,’ he eventually stuttered. 'Not because of Bucky.’His words cut her heart open with a thick blade.'It’s not the end yet, Steve,’ she groaned. 'I won’t let you go.’Her palm pressed the wound even harder  through the soaked fabric of his uniform.His eyes stared at the ceiling with less life than a few moments ago.'There are so ma-many things I now wish I had said sooner,’ he stammered with difficulty.He looked at her again. In spite of the pain, he managed to put a weak smile on his face.'No,’ she groaned hardly. 'Don’t you die on me, Rogers.’'You,’ he continued with a serene look.She shook her head vehemently, forbidding herself to listen to any more of his goodbye words.'Steve,’ she pleaded, tears filling up her eyes. 'Please, don’t give up.’She cupped his jaw and stroked his pale skin with her fingers.His eye dived deep into hers.'I-I need to say it to you before…’ he paused as he gathered a new breath in his lungs. She leaned  down towards him, her face a few inches apart from his therefore conceding to hear, although she hadn’t accepted it yet, were his final words.'Nat, I…’ she waited for him to gather enough strength to let out the following words but nothing other than a heavy silence followed.'Steve?’ she called. She slightly pulled away to take a look at him. His pupils turned still as she watched the last light of life die out. 'Steve? Steve!’ she cried desperately, her voice raising up an octave every new time she called his name. 'Please Steve, don’t!’ she begged him.A tear rolled down to her chin before falling onto Steve’s dry and blueish lips.Her heart ached more than she would have believed it possible. She had seen so many companions fall during missions, but oh God, how painful this one was.Her chest shook up as sobs forced their way out. For the first time, she yielded to her emotions and burst into tears. She leaned down over him, crying into his neck, shielding him  from any further harm with her body. The funeral was much more tedious than she expected it to be. Every Avenger was mourning or silently feeding pointless resentments.Unsurpsingly, many people attended his burial. Too many. And although the Avengers respected Steve’s request to have an open funeral if something went wrong, authorities still had to be deployed to manage then scatter the heavy crowd. America grieved the loss of its Captain, of its first Avenger, of its best soldier.Natasha was mentally worn out. She attended the funeral only because Clint told her to do it.'You were not there,’ she had muttered to h
