Chapter 1: Said Too Much
    




Chapter Text
Tony visited his Aunt Peg every Sunday.He usually brought a book with him because often she didn’t notice he was there and she rambled on. Most of what she rambled about were incidents in her past. Tony had learned all about Whitney Frost that way. And Jason Wilkes. Tony kind of wished he’d gotten the chance to meet him. Other times, she was more introspective.‘I know it was the right thing to do,’ she was currently saying. ‘But I do feel bad for Tony.’And apparently completely unaware he was the one sitting here. ‘Why?’‘Well, I made him hate his father for no reason.’ That statement made Tony freeze. ‘I know they already had a bad relationship. If I could have covered it up another way without lying to Tony, I would have. Unfortunately, the most believable lie was that Howard was drunk.’Her words came back to him. ‘I’m sorry, Tony. He got behind the wheel, drunk. He crashed the car and killed both of them.’Was he now hearing that she’d lied to him that day? Tony forced his voice to remain composed. ‘What happened?’‘Oh, there was somebody else involved.’ She nodded her head, somewhat dismissively. ‘Whoever it was, he shot the tyres out of their car. That’s why they crashed. I looked at the bodies. The assassin bashed Howard’s face in – his skull was completely caved in. Maria was strangled. That’s why we nailed the coffins shut for the funeral. It was a pity we had to lie to Tony.’‘Why did you lie to Tony?’ This time there was a distinct shake in Tony’s voice.Peg didn’t notice. ‘If it was known that they were murdered, there’d be an enquiry. Why were they killed? I couldn’t have anyone finding out about S.H.I.E.L.D., now, could I? I especially couldn’t risk Tony finding out where a chunk of his fortune goes and withdrawing it. We needed the money.’Tony slapped his book shut. ‘I have to get back to work.’ He couldn’t stand to be in the room with this woman a moment longer.‘Well, thank you for visiting.’‘No problem.’ Tony bolted out of the room.***There were two engineer modes on Tony Stark: procrastination and “something-terrible-just-happened-and-this-is-the-only-way-I-know-how-to-handle-it”. The first one had Tony coming out of his workshop to see Rhodey, go party, or look for a flavour of the night.This was the second one.Pepper strode into the mansion and headed straight for the workshop. ‘JARVIS?’‘Yes, Miss Potts?’‘Has Mr. Stark been down in the workshop since Sunday?’‘He hasn’t left at all.’‘But he wants me to come down?’‘He has discovered something quite…distressing, Miss Potts. It requires urgent attention. I recommend we be prepared to make one phone call to the FBI, one to the CIA, and one to Lt. Col. Rhodes.’With a frown, Pepper headed down to the workshop. What could be so awful that the two major intelligence agencies of the world would need to be notified? Rhodey, it was obvious. He was Tony’s best friend so he’d need to be called for moral support. Pepper descended the stairs and looked through the glass into the workshop. Tony was sitting at his workstation, glaring at the monitors.Pepper keyed in the access code and stepped in. ‘What’s going on?’Tony looked up at her. ‘I won’t be visiting Peggy Carter anymore.’Oh. She’d died? That must’ve been why Tony locked himself down here for three days. Rhodey had said he’d been despondent for ages after his parents died, and then angry. The original Jarvis had apparently dealt with all the arrangements. ‘Who’s taking care of the funeral?’‘She’s not dead.’That pulled Pepper up short. ‘Then why aren’t you seeing her again? I thought she was the only family you had left.’‘So did I.’ That was a tone she’d never heard from Tony before. Tense, with a trace of hurt running through it.‘Tony, she has Alzheimer’s,’ Pepper said. ‘What could she have possibly done that was so horrible you’re cutting contact with her?’Tony quirked a finger at her, indicating she should come over to him. Pepper walked around the work desk and to Tony’s shoulder. Tony then folded his arms and nodded to the screens. Pepper looked at them. The first thing she noticed was that Tony had hacked into some website with a falcon silhouette insignia and S.H.I.E.L.D. stamped across the centre of it. Underneath, the acronym was extended: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. The data Tony had pulled up made Pepper freeze in shock.‘Oh, my God…’Tony had a very good reason to be pissed off.‘Hm. Do you know dad funded them?’ Tony inclined his head. ‘They’re still using my money. Why don’t we contact the legal team and find out if they can actually do that?’Pepper nodded and pulled out her Blackberry.***The door was answered by Tony Stark’s redheaded PA, Pepper Potts. She led them into the house and into the living room where she picked up the evidence, which had been stacked into manila folders. The two flicked them open and started rifling through them. There was even a USB stick, which was sure to be stacked with even
