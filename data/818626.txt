Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
He was practically a child, but damn if he wasn’t the sweetest little thing Erik Lehnsherr had ever seen.Erik, as a custom jewellery maker, has had his fair share of dull days. Days where he turned up the radio and crafted jump ring after jump ring from a huge misshapen lump of silver just for something to do. That Friday was such a day, until this young man walked into the store. Before he knew it, his mutation had caused all fifteen thousand jump rings he’d crafted that morning to stand on their edge like domino’s waiting to cascade.He was shorter than Erik’s six foot one, but not too short. Five eight? Little less maybe? Thick brown hair with a slight curl. Well dressed, expensive. Wearing a waistcoat. What kind of man wears a waistcoat aside from at a wedding? Wow, an actual Cartier watch, Erik doesn’t get many of those in. Most of his clients are bohemian types. Erik reached out with his ability. Titanium credit card, Sterling tie clip, real cufflinks, steel pieces in the lace holes of his shoes, belt buckle. No wedding ring, no jewellery at all other than that watch.He turned slightly, tilting his head to get a better look at one of the more elaborate necklaces Erik had on display and, my oh my, he had very full, very red lips. Just finished kissing someone perhaps?He took a deep breath and reigned in his arousal.“Are you looking for something in particular?” he asked and the young man looked at him with the brightest, bluest eyes he’d ever seen.“A birthday gift,” he replied, and Erik was transfixed by the very proper English accent.“I’m sure there’s something here to meet your needs. Was there a certain type of piece you were looking for?”He came over and leant against the counter. “Something durable, but it still needs to be delicate looking. Blue accents perhaps, or maybe yellow if it works better. Something unique, I don’t want her to be able to find something similar at some horrible chain store,” he said and Erik felt himself groan inwardly when he said ‘her’. Straight. Of course he was.The glint of the tie clip caught Erik’s eye. It was the mutant pride symbol that had become so popular in the last few years, a circle with an x in the middle. He wondered if this man actually had a mutation or if he was just a supporter.He had a brief moment of fantasy where he and this very nice boy end up going out for a beer and then back to his apartment for some incredible sex where no one gets upset when he makes all the metal things in his bedroom float when he climaxes. And then he pushes it all to the back of his mind and smiles.“Let’s see what we can find.”@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@“He was beautiful, I tell you. Absolutely beautiful,” Erik complained, motioning to the bartender for another beer.“He was straight,” his roommate, Azazel, replied, his Russian accent slurred. Jesus, how many have they had?“He could have been bi,” Erik pointed out.“He was buying a birthday gift for a female, si?” Janos, Azazel’s much younger, wonderfully Spanish, boyfriend, pointed out in return.“I still could have gotten horizontal with him,” he argued and they’d both stopped going against him, and instead tried to work out what the hell a man does for a living that he needs to be wearing an actual waistcoat.They drank several more beers and then Azazel teleported them all back to the apartment they shared without leaving any body parts behind.If Erik spent the night dreaming about blue eyes and full red lips, no one else needed to know.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Charles took a deep breath and pushed open the door to Lehnsherr Designs, the very same door that he’d been staring at and deliberating over for the last forty three minutes.He was there again, the man who caught Charles’ eye. He was very tall, with dark hair pushed back, as if he kept running his fingers through it to get it out of his way. He can’t see them, but he noticed last time that the man has the most beautiful blue green eyes. He’s in a black t-shirt and beige slacks this time; last time it was a black turtleneck and black slacks. He’s leaning over the counter this time, focussing intently on a ring in his fingers, tools poised in his fingertips.“Hello again,” he said, and then coughed to clear his throat. “Oh! Hello. Welcome back,” he said, and there it was, that wonderful voice. Deep and kind of smoky, a little rough right on the edge of it. Perfect morning voice.“Thank you.”“Did she like it?”“Like it?”“The bracelet?”Ah, of course, the bracelet. It had taken over an hour to find the right one. In the end Charles had gone with a simple yet beautiful design. Three smooth rings of white gold, all connected by a delicate lattice of star shaped links. The first ring had a design of a branch bent into the metal, the second held a single perfect sapphire, and the third held a tiny little owl in the winding twists of gold.“She loved it, hasn’t taken it off since,” Charles said, moving forwar
