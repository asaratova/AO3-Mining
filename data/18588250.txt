Chapter One:

Devoid
Peter Hale paced in circles around the McCall living room, entertained down to his bones over events leading him – them all – to this moment.He’d always liked Stiles.It took balls of solid brass to stare into the face of an insane – and say what you liked about him, Peter had never been one for self-delusion – vengeance-obsessed Alpha werewolf and sass and snark and refuse the Bite.Couple that with Stiles being the only form of well-rounded intelligence in the strange island of misfit toys that the most disappointing Bitten ever “true alpha” or not put together and Peter genuinely liked the snarky little bastard with a violent streak a mile wide and an inferiority complex around the super-powered beings he’d become surrounded with not far behind it.Stiles was interesting.Bold red in a world of bland beige and boring.Still, even Peter could admit that his nephew hadn’t been wrong – per se – to doubt that Stiles was the Nogitsune, or rather its host.When anyone from Derek to Kate Argent to Gerard to anyone else who looked at the McCall pack, even before it became the McCall Pack, there were much more obvious choices for the power to cause damage than Stiles with his pale skin and sarcasm.Peter had never been one to take things at face value.There was a reason that he’d offered Stiles the Bite and allowed him to decline.If there was anyone remaining in this godforsaken town worthy of the gift of the Bite, someone who would make a marvelous wolf, it was unassuming Stiles Stilinski with his cunning mind, insatiable thirst for knowledge, and drive to protect what was his.Add in that Spark that anyone with any real knowledge of the supernatural could see if they were looking and well…Peter wasn’t surprised in the least that Stiles ended up being the host all along or that he’d managed to fight it and limit the damage the Nogitsune was capable of meting out for a solid six months before the events of the last few weeks.Really, until the Oni came calling and gave the Nogitsune a reason to fight Stiles harder than it had ever done before.And even that was a credit to the skinny teen that everyone always overlooked when it came to threat assessment.The Nogitsune cared as much about fucking with Stiles and keeping him off-balance, weakening him, as it did all the rest of the pack combined and if that wasn’t a compliment to how dangerous the snarky little shit was, Peter didn’t know what would be.One thing was for certain however as Peter took in the wounded form on the McCall couch being kept paralyzed by kanima venom and silent via duct-tape: the Nogitsune wasn’t taking good care of its host.A heartening sign, even if the others were too big of dolts to realize it.If it had to run down its host, keep Stiles from resting and eating or injured, then he was still strong, still capable of fighting.They just had to make Stiles see that too.Which, really, was where the pack had finally made a smart decision for once in calling Peter.Because if there was anything he knew how to do it was manipulate a situation to his advantage.“He doesn’t look like he’d survive a slap across the face, let alone a werewolf bite.”  Peter commented as he bent over to get a better look at those normally bright amber eyes that were dark and dim under the control of the fox demon.“You don’t think it would work?”  Scott asked, willing to play nice with the psychopath if it meant saving his best friend.“This is more a war of the mind than the body.”  Peter said, still searching for any hint of Stiles in the creature driving his body around like a rental car it had every intention of totaling.  He straightened up, decision made.  “There are better methods for winning this battle.”“What kind of methods?”  Alan Deaton, vet, druid, emissary, asked one of the most dangerous wolves he ever had the misfortune to know.  Peter had always been dangerous, even before the fire.  Afterwards…well.  He was just content that for the moment Peter was willing to play nice.  It was when that period of armistice lapsed that he was worried for.Peter smirked right down into those might-as-well-be-dead brown eyes, taking hold of Scott’s wrist and flicking his hand, unleashing the Alpha’s claws.“We’re going to get into his head.”Ah, finally, a reaction.Peter held in a victorious grin as the creature wearing Stiles’s face lifted his brows in interest, eyes flashing for a split-second.“Do you have a plan beyond messing around in an already traumatized and warring mind?”  Alan asked drily, eyeing Peter with unabated suspicion as the werewolf circled
