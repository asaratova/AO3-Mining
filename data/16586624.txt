Chapter 1





Chapter Text

“Tony, please,” Steve wheedled. “I just want to be a team again.”

 

Tony snorted. “A team, you say?” Steve nodded. “The same kind we were before?”

 

“So you get it?”

 

“Fuck no, Rogers. That was an abusive situation. I just didn’t recognize it at the time,” Tony said, already walking away, tapping at his phone.

 

“What?” Steve cried. “We weren’t- we didn’t- Tony, you have it all wrong.”

 

“And what, pray tell, does Tony have wrong this time?” Stephen Strange portalled in just in time to catch the end of Steve’s sentence, an unimpressed look on his face. 

 

“It’s personal, Strange,” Steve all but growled.

 

“He didn’t like that I called him abusive,” Tony stage whispered. “I think he doesn’t like the truth if it doesn't immediately benefit him.”

 

Stephen frowned. He could hear the tightness in Tony’s voice, the difficulty that the other man had at being around his abusers, and his heart ached. “Want to leave?” he whispered. Tony nodded. “I’ll handle this.”

 

Tony smiled gratefully and hopped through the portal Stephen summoned.

 

“What the hell was that for?” Steve almost screeched. “I’ve been trying to talk to him for weeks, now, and we finally get the chance, and you take him away? You have no right.”

 

“Actually,” Stephen drawled. “I have every right. He asked for a portal to get away from an uncomfortable situation. I, being a decent human being, obliged.”

 

“Do you 

enjoy

 trying to make me look like an asshole?” Steve snarled.

 

“... Am I supposed to say no?” Stephen replied. “Because I don’t think that I, in good conscience, can say no to that. It's the highlight of my day watching you make an ass of yourself. Excluding, of course, spending time with Tony.” So sue him, Stephen wasn’t above being petty. Rogers had had his chance to be a decent person, and he had failed horribly. Stephen wasn’t above reminding him of that.

 

Rogers just spluttered as Stephen portalled to Tony, leaving the portal open long enough for Steve to see Tony catch Stephen in a filthy kiss.

 

Tony wasn’t above being petty, either.
