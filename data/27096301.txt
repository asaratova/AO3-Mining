Chapter 1: Pepper Meets Peter
    




Chapter Text

Pepper went looking for Tony, who was currently on the run from a meeting that she specifically told him that he couldn’t get out of. She has had to track him down many times before, so figuring out that he was hiding in his personal lab was easy. But instead of finding Tony, a teenage boy was working on a piece of his suit. He hadn’t even noticed her yet, reminding her of when Tony got so focused on his work that he blocked everything else out. 

“What are you doing here?” 

The boy jumped at the sound of her voice and turned to face her. Now she recognized him, he was the personal intern that Tony told her about, Peter Parker was his name.

“Miss Potts, uh, hi. Mr. Stark told me to come here so I, uh, could-” 

She raised her hand to signal that he could stop, “And where is he?” 

The look on his face told her that he did know where Tony was and he probably told him not to tell her if she came looking for him.

“I-I don’t kn-know.” 

God this kid was a bad liar. Before she could press the subject, the lab door opened behind her. 

“Hey, kid. I got the pizza!” In came Tony carrying a large stack of pizzas, there were so many that they blocked his vision. Which is why he didn’t notice Pepper was there until he put them down. “Fuck.” 

“Language,” Peter said while moving to the boxes to grab a slice of pizza. 

“Whatever, you're just as bad.”

Pepper watched in amusement as Peter made the most innocent expression she had ever seen.

“I have no idea what you are talking about.” 

Tony rolled his eyes. Watching the two of them react to one another wasn’t only entertaining, but it also answered some of the questions she had about Tony’s recent behavior. Recently, he has been happier, less antisocial, and even started to gain some weight from eating regularly. She hadn’t considered that it was caused by his new intern, but now it was obvious. She bet he was the one to convince Tony to take a break in order to go get pizza, something he would have never considered before. It was nice to see him be so open with someone that wasn’t herself or Roedy.

Pepper had a feeling that she was going to like Peter Parker, especially if he kept on being so good for Tony.
