Work Text:
Sometimes Peter patrols early and then likes to unwind afterwards with a film. He stashes a change of clothes on a rooftop, changes, and goes to see whatever late night B-movie that's showing. Tonight it's a screening of something called The Apple. Peter's never heard of it. There's only one other person in the theater, sitting close to the front for some odd reason. They've got on a grey sweatshirt, the hood of it up over their head. As soon as the movie starts Peter wonders what exactly he signed up for here. There's some futuristic singing competition with terrible spandex and even worse cinematography. "Jeez, look at the buns on that," the guy in the theater says, loudly, obnoxiously. "Yeaaah. He must work out. Oops, wait, wrong movie. But it still fits."Peter shakes his head. Weirdo. The guy doesn't stop though. He gives running commentary of the choreography, the songs, the actress and how she's a long ways away from dragging around Bernie's dead body on that fateful weekend. Peter is kind of lost on all the references he throws out (and that's normally his own specialty, thank you very much) and the guy is talking faster than Peter’s brain can handle for 1 a.m., but he finds himself entertained by the chatter almost as much as the film.The guy hasn't looked behind him and Peter wonders if he thinks he's alone, which is almost endearing -- like he's behaving as he would in his own living room just because he feels like he can. Or maybe he knows Peter is there and he's just being a douchebag. Still, Peter hasn't had this much fun in a movie theater since his first real date with Gwen. When the credits begin to roll, Peter gets up and stretches. The guy still hasn't turned around. He's probably one of those types that stays all the way through the credits, regardless of the film."Hey, thanks for that, pal. Nice show," Peter calls out to him and then leaves before the guy can respond. He finds himself humming one of the film’s dumb songs on the way home, smiling.
_________________________Just when things are getting a little boring in Spider-Man land, Deadpool shows up to make them interesting."Was just passing by, saw a fine spandex-clad ass, figured you could use the assist," Deadpool says, pumping his fists in triumph after helping Peter apprehend two people that were holding up a corner market. “Your assists never really end up in my favor, Deadpool,” Peter says, rolling his eyes. He's only run into the guy a handful of times. The first ended with him stealing one of Peter’s web shooters and using it on the Wall Street bull. Peter was the prime suspect by the cop stationed there, who couldn't tell the difference between their costumes.(That last part had annoyed him more than what Deadpool did.)The second time, Deadpool somehow got Peter's phone number (his emergency superhero one, anyway), posed seductively in a Spider-Man costume, and had a billboard created with the words "For a good time call", followed by his digits. (Peter was still getting phone calls.)The third time consisted of a bouquet of roses, a string quartet, and more cops involved, this time wondering why an impromptu orchestra had been set up on the TKTS stairs in Time Square. (Answer: It had been Valentine’s Day and Deadpool was apparently either a romantic or a stalker, Peter hadn’t fully formed his opinion yet. He was still deciding on whether or not he’d been horrified or flattered.)So, no, things couldn't be called boring when Deadpool came back around, but Peter also didn't need this kind of excitement in his life. "Aw, sweetums, do you not approve of grand gestures? Does that not impress you much, Shania? I can tone it down a notch."Peter tilts his head skeptically. "I can!" Deadpool insists. "I mean, look it, I didn't even unalive anyone tonight.""Well, that definitely wouldn't impress me much, so thanks, I suppose?""Anything for you, baby boy.""I'm going to ignore that one. And uh, I don't really need your help? I had it handled."Deadpool puts his hands over his heart. "You wound me, Webs. Don't do me like that.""I won't be doing you like anything, Deadpool," Peter quips. Deadpool is delighted. "I love it when you talk dirty to me, baby.""Oh my god, I'm going.""Don't be a stranger, baby boy! Call me! 1-800-Need-The-D."“That's too many numbers!” Peter yells back as he swings off into the night. "What? No, not the, da! D.A! As in, ‘Dat Ass’. Which -- dat ass, damn, Spidey.” “Oh,” Peter mutters. "Still not calling you!" he yells to Deadpool, flushing. “Especially not now!” "I'll wear ya down!"Peter doubts that very much.
___________________________________The next time Peter goes to a movie it's after a final. He's dead tired and just wants to escape to a place that isn't his own apartment, because sometimes it feels even more lonely there. He chooses some Seth Rogen comedy that’s been out for ages now. It's 1pm on a Tuesday and there's no one there. Peter falls asleep 30 minutes in until he hears, "The only good thin
