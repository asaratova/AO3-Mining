Summary:

Introduction





Chapter Text
 "Are you sure this is a good idea?" Tony asked, stopping his pacing to look at Peter."Yeah!" Peter responded, excited that not only did Tony like Peters idea but might actually make it happen. "It will show the more… you know, human side of the Avengers."Tony frowned. "The what? Last time I checked I was, still am by the way, 100% human""I mean the big family side. Everyone knows who the Avengers are, but they don't know who they really are outside of the hero stuff." Peter explained. Tony nodded slowly and turned to the head of PR, Blake, who they had consulted for a more professional opinion. "What do you think?"Blake thought about it for a moment before answering."I think it's a good idea. Sure millions of people love the Avengers, but there are also plenty who still think that you are dangerous weapons of destruction. We could prove them wrong by showing your more, 'human side' as the kid put it."Peter turned to Tony with hopefull puppy eyes.  "Ross has been going after my ass lately..." Tony considered, avoiding those hopefull eyes."And the team agreed to it?" It wasn't really a question, Tony already knew the answer."Yes, they think it will be fun." Peter nodded firmly.Tony switched his gaze between Peter and Blake before sighing. "Alright, you can host your little show or whatever"Peter jumped up in excitement and went for a hug. Tony smiled and patted his back. "Yeah yeah... still not that comfortable with hugs." "Oh, right! sorry" Peter quickly let go. Tony stopped him by his arm before he ran off. "I don't want any confidential information in these videos, alright?" Tony warned. "none" "Right! I can edit it out!" Peter responded. Tony nodded and Peter headed for the door. A big grin creeping on his face.He couldn't wait to tell the others.
