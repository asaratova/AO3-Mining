Chapter 1: making the choice and starting the change
    




Chapter Text
“I choose…” Harry looked between the three begins and has parental figures before looking back toward Lady Death. “I choose the path that will lead me into the past to change the future. The middle of the paths behind you Lady Death. I’ll go to the time when I can stop the destruction from beginning, and I’ll go as Hyacinth Jaye to honor the name my parents chose for me when I was to be a female.” Harry stated looking at the group around him. “Will I have the knowledge I’ll need to survive in the past?”“Yes, child. You’ll be a hidden omega, females at the time had little control in the magical world. It was better than it had been before the first world war but still needs many years to get to the place you know. Omega’s were seen as lesser even than women and have no true rights. You’re second state will be revealed when you meet and recognize your destined mates. You’ll age as they do after you bond. You will not have an easy time after bonding with them until it is closer to the time you came from, but you will find love and a true family.” Lord Fate stated with a sorrowful look in his eyes. “We’ll alter the memories that would know you so that you won’t face scrutiny for being out of place.”“You will be Hyacinth Jaye LeFay, last of the line LeFay, blessed and chosen by Lady Magic. The line comes from your mother’s side and so is truly a line that you would have inherited if you had remained a female in your own world.” Lady Magic stated softly as she approached Harry.With a touch removed the potion and alterations that Dumbledore had caused for him changing Harry into a petite female of seventeen, standing only 5’0 with obsidian hair filled with red highlights, deep jade eyes, and ruby red lips upon a pale countenance with a light smattering of freckles. The clothing that Harry was wearing changed into clothing appropriate for 1936, the plaid straight skirt with a solid top, plaid belt, blocky kitten heels, and light-colored hat that matched the lighter colors on her skirt. Hyacinth’s hair was short and curled at the top of her neck showing on the back of her neck the symbol that Lord Fate decided would be the soulmark for the ones that she would be matched with, the image of a tribal style phoenix and dragon with a trinity Celtic knot, within the knot was the names Steven and James.“We’re proud of you baby.” Lily and James stated while hugging her after the change was complete.“You’ll knock them dead Pup.” Sirius stated smiling softly as he looked at his goddaughter.“We’ll be with you always. Let your inner snake free be the Slytherin in Gryffindor skin that I know you can be.” Severus stated seeing more of her mother in her than had been when the potions were in place.“Everything will be alright; you’ll be able to perform so much mischief.” Remus stated giving a gentle kiss to her forehead.“We can’t erase your past, for it is what made you who you are. But we can help you change your future and give you joy.” Lady Magic stated as she watched the rest give her some love. “Do not fear your intelligence, instead embrace it for you’ll surely change the world.”With a sigh the newly reformed Hyacinth Jaye LeFay turned back to the path that she had chosen to take. Lady Magic had sorted out her thoughts enough that when she finished the transformation she was able to think of herself as a female instead of male that she had been for 17 years of her life. She walked to the archway that lead to the path she had chosen, with a brief look back to see the love and support that was held in her families eyes she stepped through the arch and landed in a line at customs to enter New York City. She looked at her hands and saw that she held her passport in one hand and the other held her suitcase. She was standing behind a tall gangly gentlemen with curly brown hair, who was wearing a blue trench style wool jacket and trousers tucked into combat style work boots. She tuned back in when she heard the gentleman standing behind the customs desk ask to see in the man’s bag and she caught him change the lock on the bag and couldn’t help but smirk, so this was a fellow wixen then. She caught the name Scamander and wondered if this was the famous, or infamous depending on opinion, Newt Scamander, she had only ever seen an older image of him on the back of his world-famous book about animals. If she remembered right this was about the time that he was writing it and he had gone to New York at a time of conflict.“NEXT!” The man cried out after he let Mr. Scamander through finally, Hyacinth stepped up and handed over her passport with a soft timid smile. “Miss LeFay…reason for visit?”“I’m actually moving here.” Hyacinth stated in a soft voice.“Reason for move?” The man changed his wording with a raised eyebrow.“Simply getting a new start.” Hyacinth replied while still softly spoken it was with a core of steel in her voice at being questioned as she was.“Do
