It started, Peter supposed, when they discovered that there was an actual channel on television that taught people how to cook. The origin story was that of Peter, mouth gaping, hands excitedly gesturing in the air. It was Aunt May's face of dismay as she thought about using the new fitbit she won at a bingo night versus trying to keep Peter happy as they rambled on about making dulche le leche and macarons. And it was - decidedly - the chance encounter with a stranger. Or, perhaps. Maybe the second encounter. Somehow along the lines - however the origin story - Peter Parker found themselves laughing happily as a puff of flour ballooned in the air. And the friends around blinked and coughed and laughed too. ______________________________ The sound of the person in front of him's headphones faintly registered as Matt tried to tune it out but couldn't quite ignore it. The person - a teenager: heartbeat a tad anxious and fingers tapping against their leg in an offbeat pattern - shuffled forward as the line moved. Matt stepped forward as well. The lingering scent of musky sweet deodorant lingered and Matt registered idly that the person in front of him was a teenage boy. "Is that skirt velvet? I love it! And you look so cute!" The barista said quickly, sounding both genuine and excited before asking, "Anyways, what can I get you?"  The teenager in front of Matt laughed in surprised delight. "Oh, thank you!" Matt cocked his head as he registered the exchange and compared it to his earlier observations. He had, he realized, been too quick to assume that someone was cis. Which made him wince internally. He had thought that ever since that night so many years ago when Foggy -  heart pounding but voice forcibly casual - told him that he wasn't cis, that he wouldn't be so quick to assume other people were either. Obviously, Matt still needed to work on that more than he had thought.  The teenager in front of him put away their change as the barista printed them their receipt. "It has pockets too!" They added shyly, in response to the barista's praise.  Then they stepped aside to wait for their drink, and Matt moved up forwards as next in the line.  ____________________________ A crash sounded as a teenager - heartbeat fast, sweat levels high, the tinny sound of discarded earphones draped around their neck but still playing music - toppled into the store's travel mug display on their way out.  Heads swiveled towards the ruckus immediately. "Oh. Oh heck. Heckaroo. Heck, heck, heck." The teenager muttered in soft alarm as they set down their drink and began picking up the fallen display. It was the teenager with the new skirt, Matt realized; their voice was familiar and their velvet material swished softly as they knelt on the ground. Matt resolutely stared straight ahead.  It wasn't his problem, after all.  And no, his urge to help wasn't because he felt guilty about potentially accidentally misgendering a random teenager in his thoughts.  "You should watch where you're going, you freak." Someone from the back of the line sneered.  The teenage froze for a moment. Then they resumed picking up the cups, their head ducked down and shoulders hunched a bit defensively.  Matt breathed in through his nose.  The barista placed his drink on the counter. "Er," They said awkwardly, apparently unsure how to alert Matt and also a tad preoccupied with the ongoing commotion. "Your drink.  "Thanks." Matt grabbed the drink with one drink and turned to leave. The line shuffled forward as he did so, and Matt didn't hesitate.  He swung his cane in an arch that was too deep for the crowded space. There was a deep yelp as Matt struck with deliberate but seemingly accidental aim.  "Sorry," He said amiably, tapping his cane of the tiled floor to give the bounce a more noticeable effect. "Didn't see you there. Although, you really should watch where you're going."  The teenager's head shot up as Matt finished parroting the bigot's own earlier words back to them. The person made a protesting noise as they also recognized it. "That was on purpose!" They accused.  Matt ignored them and simply continued walking.  "Wait!" The teenager said, scrambling to their feet as Matt exited the door.  Matt didn't slow down his brisk pace. He didn't. Honestly.  The teenager quickly fell in step with him, having easily caught up. They brought with them the scent of caramel coffee and the sound of tinny music still playing from their forgotten earbuds.  "I wanted to thank you." The teenager said shyly. "That was really cool of you - back there." Matt shrugged. "I didn't do anything."  The teenager laughed. "Okay. Sure you didn't." The teenager was quiet for a few steps.  "My name is Peter." They spoke up suddenly. "Peter Parker. I'm a student. Well, and photographer." The teenager hesitated but then continued in a quick exhaled flurry of words. "They/them pronouns."  Matt inclined his head. "Matthew Murdock." He said calmly and causally.  "Attorney. He
