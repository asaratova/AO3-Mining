Chapter 1: Holding Hands    Steve/Darcy
    




Chapter Text
1 Holding hands
There had been alarms and explosions and rockets and robots and running. Way too much running but hey she had been training with Tasha so it wasn't as bad as she had imagined. Plus running meant no fighting and she was all for no fighting.  Only because if Her training was anything to go by she was woefully under prepared.
Although it was hard to gauge where your skill level was when your only sparring partner was one of the deadliest people in the world. Maybe she was pretty badass?  Probably not though. It was more likely that Steve had the right idea to get her away from danger.
She glanced ahead at him and smiled. When had he grabbed her hand?
Turning a corner he pulled her with him, forcing her to keep up by their intertwined hands. She couldn't slow down. Couldn't rest. Couldn't go anywhere but where he led.
Jane would find that funny. Point out how telling it was about their relationship.
Steve had been trying to convince her to move in with him for weeks. Hell he had been trying to convince her of everything since the day he had met her. Was it strange that someone like her had a hard time believing that all that perfection wanted only her?
Perhaps when this was all over she should listen?
Her pulled her into a closet and pressed his body against the door. His hands searching over her looking for any injuries.
"Yes."
"Are you hurt?" She realized he was only using one hand, refusing to let go with the other. "Wait. What?" That confused look on his face shouldn't be as sexy as it was.
"Lets move in." Steve stopped looking over her for injuries, meeting her eyes. He searched her face for something. "I love you, you love me. The world is crazy. Let's share coffee mugs."
"Are you sure?" He looked so hopeful.
"Yes. And I'm safe in this super secure closet so go join the rest of the team and get rid of whatever the bad guy of the week is because I'm going to need you to do all the heavy lifting. I hate moving but if I get to watch you carry things it might not be such a bad day."
He used his free hand to pull her closer, kissing her quickly on the lips before turning to leave. He glanced down for a moment at where their hands were still joined. Pausing her brought them to his lips and kissed the back of her hand before releasing it and vanishing out the door.
