Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 He had breached the fiftieth floor of the tower when Loki’s ward warned him of the intrusion. He tried to wake Tony while alerting Jarvis to the change.The AI was far more helpful than Loki’s half asleep lover.Loki was sitting upright as Tony wound his arms around Loki’s hips, resting his head on Loki’s lap.Loki was mildly annoyed by how inattentive he was to the threat, but also knew that this was the first time he’d really slept in the past three days.Loki would have to handle this on his own.After calibrating his sensors Jarvis was able to pick up the noise of someone moving. They were nearly silent and were staying completely out of view of Jarvis’ cameras, motion detectors, and heat sensors.Loki took in a deep breath, ignoring how pleasantly warm Tony was against him, and cast a spell to give him eyes and ears on the fiftieth floor.A rough looking man with tangled hair and a metal arm appeared in an illusion in front of the bed.Loki could tell with just a glance that he wasn’t imbued with magic, but he wasn’t quite human either.He needed to be captured, but he really didn’t want to leave bed, not with the way Tony was holding him so lovingly.“Facial recognition?” Loki asked Jarvis in a hushed voice.“I have identified him as Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, former member of the Howling Commandos which Captain Rogers led. After his capture he was brainwashed into being an assassin for Hydra, known as the Winter Soldier. His identity was revealed to a select group after the incident in DC three months ago. Currently Captain Rogers and former Airman First Class Samuel Thomas Wilson are in Tennessee trying to track him down.”Loki held back a scoff. They were clearly off course.“Please inform Rogers that he is a dullard and his former brother in arms is currently in New York, verbatim.”“Of course.”Loki watched as the Winter Soldier scaled to the next floor without tripping the alarm system.“Once he is capture we shall tell Rogers we have him. No need to stir false hope.” Loki had had enough of that in his life. “Suggestions on how we capture him?”“Floor sixty-three is empty—Captain Rogers is calling. Would you like me to answer?”“No. Continue with what you were saying.”“The floor is nearly empty with only two entrances. Placing a containment spell directly in front of each of these point should be sufficient. After which point I can close the air ducts and fill the area with knock out gas. Will that suffice?”“I suppose it will have to.” Loki closed his eyes and projected himself to the sixty-third floor, easily and putting the spells in place without ever having to leave bed.Loki watched on vigilantly while his hand idly caressed Tony’s head, neck, and shoulders.It took the Winter Soldier over two hours of careful footwork and maneuvering to make it to the sixty-third floor.Loki’s trap sprung, a tinted orb of green forming all around the Winter Soldier. The look on his face reminded Loki far too much of a cornered animal as he tried to punch his way out. No fissures formed though. The spherical shield was made of magic and only magic could harm it.The Winter Soldier only fought harder when Jarvis started flooding the area with knock out gas. It took nearly forty-five minutes for the area to be filled and for the intruder to finally succumb to it.Loki let out a small sigh of relief.Loki wouldn’t allow anyone volatile around Tony, excluding himself.He settled in the blankets, easily maneuvering Tony around.“If he shows any signs of regaining consciousness wake me,” Loki ordered.“As you wish.”The lights dimmed until only the glow of the arc reactor was left.Loki closed his eyes, despite knowing he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep until the threat was thoroughly dealt with.Instead he just reveled in the feeling of Tony being in his arms, safe and warm.Tony woke up the same way he always did, suddenly and unhappily.The feeling was quickly brushed aside when he saw that he was practically nose to nose with Loki, whose green eyes were wide awake.This was a common occurrence that had originally freaked him out, but now that he’d gotten used to Loki’s eyes being the first thing he saw in the morning it made waking up a little less annoying.Tony leaned in and gave him a peck on the nose. Loki smiled brightly in return.“I wish we could stay like this, but we have an intruder and I haven’t been able to properly relax since I took notice of him,” Loki said, his breath minty fresh.“J?” Tony asked while sitting up.The TV screen lit up, showing an unconscious Winter Soldier surrounded by Loki’s magic.“Captain Rogers has left several messages regarded our guest,” Jarvis informed him and Loki snorted at the word guest.“Just give him a status update and send a pic.” Jarvis didn’t respond, but Tony trusted that he would do as he was told. “Guess we should go down there, yeah?” Tony asked, already halfway out of the bed.“Leave him to the captain. Beyond his presence he’s none of our concern.”“He broke i
