Chapter Text
 Getting caught in a lie is rarely the problem; it’s getting caught in a lie just frequently enough that someone else’s theory about your guilt is more believable than the truth. The phenomenon was familiar enough to a certain god of lies and mischief, so by rights, he really should have seen all this coming from the start. ~~  Captain Fury was not startled to find Dr. Steven Strange in his office. In fact, Fury had all but lost the ability to be startled, especially by strange and disconcertingly powerful individuals waiting for him in places they shouldn’t really be able to access in the first place. He mused that he'd been overdue for his third one this week anyway. “What is it?” The old soldier closed the door and locked it for good measure, walking around the magician to sit at his desk. “The keeper of the Soul gem is lost.” Strange shot Fury a pointed look. “And the keeper of the Power gem may be missing. That one was next on Loki’s itinerary, if one judges by the sort of questions he’s been asking my contacts of recent. Admittedly, it’s the next easiest to find, though far trickier to actually collect.” Fury leaned over his desk, resting his elbows on it. “What do you expect me to do about it? We’ve not had much luck going after him before, and now he’s on good terms with at least a third of the Avengers, possibly half or more.” Strange arched an eyebrow, looking mildly bemused. “Really? I know a pair of them are assassins, but honestly, they struck me as quite loyal.” “It’s not your business, at this point, Doctor,” Fury warned, though he could already feel a headache coming on. “Keep an eye out for anything suspicious here on earth. He’s been doing Asgard’s dirty work lately, and so long as he keeps most of his current destruction out of our back yard, I’m not risking any of my teams by sending them after Loki.” “Of course, I wouldn’t recommend sending even the Avengers, truly,” the magician agreed. “Especially not when you might instead send an experienced and powerful sorcerer long since entrusted by certain powers with the Space gem.” He smiled a sharp, satisfied little smile. Fury’s eyes narrowed. “You’re certain that this gem wouldn’t be easily taken from you?” “How could it be? Furthermore, how could he even get close enough to touch me, when all I need do is be out of reach. Handily,” he said, pulling a chain from under his shirt to display a large stone of deep, rich purple hanging from it, “I can be wherever it is I want to be, at any given time.” After a moment’s consideration, Fury nodded. “Keep an eye out, and keep me apprised.” His lips twitched. “Also, don’t harm Tony Stark if you can avoid it.” Strange blinked at that, bemused. “What part does Stark have in this?” Fury almost recommended that the magician pick up a newspaper, but was feeling too irritated to spoil the surprise. “He’s close to Loki; they worked out a business deal, with Stark providing materials for Asgard to rebuild their ‘rainbow bridge’ and the pair of them got on like a house on fire.” “That could prove unfortunate,” Strange mused. “I will take it into consideration.” ~~  Seeking his prey out in Alfheim, Loki required some small degree of anonymity to pass through the main city without arousing too much suspicion, or spreading too much more gossip than collected. Luckily, it was one of the realms unfamiliar with some of the god of mischief’s better disguises, one of which suited her purposes more than adequately: namely, the one which changed most of the pronouns one might apply to Loki. Escaping the more populated regions after confirming certain rumors, she descended into the darker regions of the forest, where all signs indicated that the keeper of the power gem had last sought sanctuary. Dark and ominous forests in the realm of fae were not safe places even for most gods to tread, but Loki had spent more time in them than most of her kin, and had only come out the worse for it on about five of those dozen or so occasions. Cloaking spells in effect, Loki banished the alluring green dress in favor of more practical traveling clothes: trousers and a fitted tunic, which still––to the god of mischief’s amusement––managed to show off sufficient cleavage to potentially be useful for strategic distraction purposes. It had been some time since Loki had taken this form, and the first time he had felt comfortable enough to do so after learning more of his heritage. And what better way to re-familiarize himself with one of his preferred guises than to hunt whilst in it? Ravens cawed nearby, a whole unkindness of them, low and argumentative. Loki listed in, but they really were debating, rather than observing any passerby, to the god’s minor annoyance. Creeping through the increasingly troublesome underbrush, the god of mischief found footprints of the appropriate size and shape, indicative that her prey had been nearby within half a day’s time. She knelt close, and examined them c
