Chapter 1: In the Beginning a Father had a word with his son.
    




Chapter Text
Before creation was old, a father took his son to a high mountain. "They won't understand us, they'll take what the Gods have painted and corrupt it. Let me guide them, father. Let me spare them the heart ache."The Father looks into the sun as it sets purple, gold and red. His sons words heavy on his heart. "They cannot be whole, unless they learn to love one another. Love another as they love the self." "I will give them a guide, then. A morning star to light the way." The wings behind the dark haired man crack and agitate in the new air. His mind has been made. The father despairs. "There is a price for such a gift, my son.""I'll pay it. A thousand times."
