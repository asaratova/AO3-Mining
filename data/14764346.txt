Chapter 1: Preface
    


Notes:
Edit: 15/06/2018Welcome, new readers! As a continuation of Anew, this fic will remain mildly unfriendly toward the Ex-vengers. There won't be much screen time reserved for them. Please consider the tags very carefully before you proceed. Those who cannot stomach characters facing consequences for their actions need not read. Otherwise, enjoy the story!

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text
This fic is the sequel to Anew. It is the second instalment of my slightly ambitious IronStrange MCU Overhaul.As a time-travel do-over series, it is strongly recommended that you begin reading from the start of Anew. However, if you are impatient like me and would prefer to skip 130k+ worth of Tony's do-over and Stephen's origin story, you can jump straight into this one as both Anew and Renew can be read separately.This fic will update on every Sunday, beginning from 10th June 2018.
