Chapter 1





Chapter Text
All things considered, a strange woman being sat on Jane’s sofa when she got home was not the weirdest thing that could have happened to her.She wore tight-fitting black and green, accentuating what would be seen of her pale skin. Despite that her eyes were dark, and much of her head was concealed behind what looked like a crown. What looked like branches of black reached out from its sides, filling up an impressive amount of the room.“Um, hi?” Jane Foster said.“Who are you?” the woman said.“…Shouldn’t I be saying that?” Jane said. “This is my house, and you’re… uh…”“I am Hela. Goddess of Death, Queen of Asgard.”“You’re… friends with Thor?” Jane said, slowly.“Hardly,” Hela said.She paused, before lifting her hands and running them over the sides of her head. As she did they seemed almost to rub out the crown she wore, exposing long black hair.“The Bifrost opened to this world, near this area, often,” Hela said. “Far more than I would expect for such an irrelevant world. I would know why. The energies converge around this home. If Thor is the one you know, were you his concubine?”“Girlfriend,” Jane said awkwardly. “And was. I broke up with him. And- why do you care?”“Indeed?” Hela said. “Asgard has changed much I see. I care because Asgard is mine now, I have bested its defenders and taken its throne once more for my own. I should know why this world was visited so often. And everything that belonged to those I conquered is now mine.”“Excuse me?” Jane said.She took a nervous step back. Hela seemed unconcerned.“The old ways,” Hela said. “You are the spoils of war.” She paused. “I see you are unprepared. Very well, my curiosity is sated nonetheless. Soon I will return to this world to reinforce Asgardian control, we will meet again then, but this place is not my first priority.”Jane fidgeted.She didn’t know what to make of Hela. Yes, there was something unnerving about her, but there was more. The confidence in her gaze and actions, her apparently older form promising experience and power…It wasn’t like she had any reason to hate Hela. True she was odd, but so were many Asgardians. And-“I will give you this choice only once,” Hela said. “Stay on this world and fight with the rest of your people when I return, or come back as my prize.”“…Prize how?” Jane said.“Mine to use however I wish, whenever I wish,” Hela said. “My servant in all matters of the flesh. You would have chambers that put this… house to shame, and you would want for nothing for so long as you obeyed me.”“You’d let a human live in Asgard?” Jane said. She hesitated. “Not just drop in once every couple of months and make excuses?”“Why would I leave you here rather than have you close at hand?” Hela said.“Don’t ask me,” Jane muttered to herself, annoyed. She swallowed and looked back up. “So, servant in all matters of the flesh. That… sounds like sex slave.”“Midgardians have such crude ways of putting things,” Hela said.She paused. Then Hela twitched one hand, and Jane just about caught a glimpse of five small shards of darkness, not unlike the substance that had composed Hela’s crown, form.The five specks moved at lightning speed. Two ran up Jane’s arms and over her shoulder, moving at such a blistering rate she felt then cut into and through her top. Despite that Hela was proficient enough with their use to ensure they left no mark on Jane’s skin. She couldn’t feel them as any more than a ghost.Another two ran up her legs, slicing the outer side of her pants, while the fifth was only felt for a moment in the middle of her back.All five moved in unison, taking less than a second before they returned to Hela’s hand and vanished.Jane’s jeans split in two, half crumpling behind her and half in front. It took her a moment to realise her panties had gone with them. And at the same time her top and bra were falling, with the top and back cut there was nothing keeping it up.“Don’t move,” Hela said, an instant before Jane tried to cover herself.“What are-”“Examining my spoils,” Hela said.“I haven’t agreed-”“I am seeing if it is a choice worth giving you,” Hela said. “My brother’s tastes are not my own. Turn.”“I-” Jane began, half-squeaking, before she saw Hela’s eyes.Suddenly bright red, and completely exposed, Jane turned until her back was to Hela, and Hela ordered her to stop.This was not how she’d expected this day to go. One moment she was walking home to just collapse and watch Netflix, the next she was naked in front of some Asgardian Goddess who wanted to make her a-It was hard to disobey Hela. Jane didn’t know what to make of that. It didn’t feel like any kind of compulsion, more something primal.People had worshipped the Asgardians once upon a time, thought of them as gods. Hela, more than any other Jane had seen, seemed able to tap into that.Or maybe she’d developed an Asgardian kink somewhere along the way. Jane rolled her eyes. That would be typical.“Turn,” Hela said again.Jane faced the Goddess once more. Hela didn
