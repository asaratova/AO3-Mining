Chapter 1: Can't catch a break
    


Notes:
Because you voted the second choice, I'm giving you the second choice (That doesn't mean I'm not planning on writing both of them, it just means I'm writing this one first).The tags are not complete, because I'm giving you the chance to guess what the team found in that Hydra base.Tomorrow I'm going to respond to the comment (or comments) that had got it right and I will update the tags.The next chapter will pe posted around New Year's Eve, when I will give you the birthdays of the characters (to make it easier for you to pinpoint their ages), as well as the fic that inspired me (because I'm giving credits to the ones that deserve them).

Chapter Text
The quinjet landed not too far from the shady abandoned Hydra base. From the jet came out four well known people: Bucky Barnes, formerly known as the Winter Soldier, good ol' Captain America, Steve Rogers, agent Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye (although he's semi-retired and has been for five years) and everyone's favorite, the Russian triple-agent, Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow."Come on boys" Nat went ahead of the group "Let's see what we can find. From what we know so far, this place used to be filled with research and testing labs."Stepping inside the base, the group split into two teams: Natasha and Clint went to check the building, while Steve and Bucky went to find the labs. They were most likely hidden beneath the base."This place looks deserted." Clint kept moving boxes around, blowing dust around the entire room. "This boxes look like they were left here on purpose. Like whoever was working here-""-took what they needed and ran away before SHIELD got the chance to find them." Nat was working on getting whatever information was left in their database."Exactly!" Picking up a syringe for one of the boxes, Clint turned to Nat. "Check this out. This guys were working on some kind of serum.""Give me the syringe." He handed her the syringe, then moved to another box. She turned the syringe in her palm before putting it aside, next to the USB that was now containing encrypted information from the computers. "Let's hope it's not an attempt to recreate the Super Soldier serum. I'm tired of this already.""It's all they ever wanted. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if they had other Winter Soldiers in the basement.""Romanoff!" From her earpiece Steve's voice sounded very concerned."Speaking of basements" Nat turned her attention to the voice in her ear. "What did you find?""You wouldn't believe me.""Try me." Maybe they were other Super Soldiers here."Come here" Then there was a pause "And call Stark. We will need him at the Compound by the time we go back."This couldn't be good. "How bad is it?""Very bad." Well, shit!"Boys! Dinner is ready in five! Get out of the garage or I'll come down there and drag you out!" At the voice of his wife, Tony Stark put down the engine parts he was working on and, with a wave of his hands, turned off the music that was blasting through the speakers and all of the holograms around the room."Hey! Did you forgot I was here? We're not done." 10 years old Harley Stark looked at his father like he had committed a federal crime.All Tony could do was laugh at his son's pouting face, a spitting image of himself when someone dared to interrupt him. "Come on bud, you're mom said dinner is ready.""I'm not hungry." The boy crossed his arms as a sign of protest."I don't care. I'm not risking her killing me because I left you here alone." Who would've thought the genius will end up dragging his kid out of the lab like Pepper had done with him so many times before.At the dining table Harley made his mission to convince his little brother, 5 years old Peter, that playing with the food was perfectly fine, all while their mother was juggling feeding 7 months old baby Morgan and talking with Tony about one thing or another."Natasha tried to call you today but you were, apparently, too busy." Pepper wasn't exactly happy that the team wanted Tony's help giving that he was retired from almost five years now, but he had the last say when it came down to helping the Avengers. That was their agreement."Oh, yeah? And what does she wants this time?" Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw the boys entertaining themselves and threw a smirk at them.Pepper realized what was happening and turned her attention to the boys. "If you're done, you can go play in your rooms.""But mom, this just became interesting.""Will daddy go on a mission?" Peter, like his big brother, was Iron Man's biggest fan. But, unlike Harley, he wasn't old enough to remember his father as a superhero. For the little boy, the Avengers are like the superheroes in movies or books, he doesn't know the sacrifices and the dangers that the superhero life entails."I'm not going in any mission." The disappoint in the boys' eyes reminded Tony of the day before their tri
