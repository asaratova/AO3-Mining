 His name was James Buchanan Barnes of the 107th’; he was raised primarily by his mother and older sister; he was Brooklyn born and bred, the middle child of three, four if you counted little Stevie Rogers from next door. He liked burgers and plums and he was good at math.His friends called him Bucky.And it grated on him.Not the nickname, ridiculous as it was, rather the fact that he was being identified as anything other than who – and what – he was.He didn’t want to be Bucky Barnes. But the soldier hadn’t wanted anything in a long time.“Doll, for goodness’ sake, if you keep staring at that screen you’re gonna give yourself another migraine.”“Boo bear, it’s for the greater good,” Tony whined, already pouting up at him as the Super Soldier steered him up and out of his chair towards the well-used couch in the workshop.Of all the skills he found most useful after Hydra, after Romania, after Leipzig, after Siberia; it was this: playing a role was much easier than being himself.He’d been under Hydra’s thumb for seventy years and hadn’t made a single decision for himself that wasn’t between life or death.Preferences and choices were already overwhelming enough, topping it off with personal responsibility and accountability sent him spiraling; where did his actions begin, and Hydra’s control end? The moral dilemma of his existence and continued freedom was always up for debate, for him and for the people of the world that were affected by his actions in the past seventy-odd years, no matter how often Steve insisted that it wasn’t your fault.Which was why he was doing what he was doing.The smaller stuff; what to eat, what to wear, what to say, what he liked; was much more easily decided on if he was pretending to be someone else.If he groomed himself just right he looked exactly like the man in the war reel – if he watched those often enough, he’d get those little ticks down; the way the man used to walk or fiddle or glance around. Eventually, he’d get the drawl down until he was no longer hearing the Russian accent slanting his thoughts, until the Brooklyn tumbled off his tongue like it had never left.Eventually, he’d be James Buchanan Barnes, because that’s who he was, wasn’t he?For all anyone knew, the only person walking around in Bucky Barnes’ body was Bucky Barnes himself.Steve ate it up with a spoon, and Tony, even after their scarred history and tentative re-acquaintanceship, believed it enough to trust the soldier to move him around.Though, less than a minute later, that illusion was shattered when the realization was made that Tony wanted to be moved all along.Already, the engineer was reclining on the cushions, another holographic screen stretching before him out of thin air; his soaked feet crossed at the ankles, dark hair a perfect tousled mess, his shirt sleeves long rolled up and exposing bronzed arms with his tie already loosened and the buttons undone to show off his throat in open invitation; the picture of comfort in the company of someone who was more monster than man.The soldier's mouth dried up as Tony fluttered his lashes, exuding innocence. With a grunt to hide the stutter of his movements, the soldier asked, “Is the greater good gonna have to deal with your whiny ass for the rest of the night?”“You like my whiny ass just fine,” Tony remarked, wiggling his brows.Bucky Barnes would have flirted back, that much he knows, but all the soldier manages is a deadpan reply, “It is the only organic thing I eat.”Fortunately, the shaky ground with which the Accords were fought over (amongst other things) kept the chasm gaping between Steve and Tony even a year after the fact, and Steve would be none the wiser to the soldier’s less than stellar performance when it was just him and Tony.After all, Tony didn’t know better.The screen before the engineer flickered out in time to his jaw coming unhinged, lips parting beautifully as Tony gaped in clear surprise, “Oh my god, you just made a joke about eating ass.”Again, more formal and awkward and less suave than Bucky, the soldier defended, “My tastes are refined.”“No kidding,” Tony declared, barking a laugh regardless, the noise sounding so different to when he heard it outside of the comfort of the workshop.Then again, everything about Tony seemed different outside of this sanctuary that Tony found fit to share with the soldier.From the way he smiled more with his eyes, the way his smirk was less sharp and more teasing, and the responses that slipped from his lips were equally devoid of their cutting quality when they were out of the limelight – hidden from the media that constantly lingered beyond the walls, and away from the other occupants of the Tower.He supposed it was a self-preservation tactic of sorts. The soldier could understand the necessity of it.Even with the Tower being Tony’s home, the people that surrounded and outnumbered him outside of the workshop and his private penthouse on the top floor were closer to hostile bystanders tha
