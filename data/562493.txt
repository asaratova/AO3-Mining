Chapter 1





Chapter Text
"We are very desperate.""I'm not doing it," Tony repeats for what has to be the fifth—eighth?—time.  "I'm up to my eyeballs in circuits and coding.  I don't have time to teach a course.""I'm sorry," Dean Fury says, leaning over his giant desk and glaring down at Tony, "it seem I phrased that as a question.""Nick, let's stop and think about this for a second," Tony says, trying very hard to keep the panic out of his voice.  He's pretty sure Fury can smell fear.  "I'm selfish and neurotic and I don't play well with others.  I would make a terrible professor.  There's got to be someone else.  Anyone else would be a better choice.  Really.""Trust me, Stark, you weren't my first choice.  But Professor Pym's still in the hospital after being hit by that bus, Jones is on maternity leave, and Coulson just died." Fury smiles at Tony.  It's not a nice smile.  "And your grant funding is conditional on your teaching a course if requested by the university.""You're not going to touch my funding.  My research is important.  If I succeed with this reactor generator, it will be huge for this school.  You're not going to screw that up over one stupid course.""No?  You want to try me?"Tony really doesn't.  Fury is scary when he's like this.  But he also doesn't want to teach.  He's an inventor, not a teacher.  If he'd wanted to teach he'd have fucked around at teacher's college for a year drawing hearts and butterflies and braiding people's hair or what-the-fuck-ever people do while they're learning how to be useless from other useless people."There's got to be a hundred grad students at this school.  Ninety-nine of them would make better professors than me!  Ask one of them to do it.""Ninety-nine of them didn't blow up the engineering lab last month.""That is vastly overstating the case.  It was one tiny explosion.   Contained!""Contained by the brand new engineering lab."“It’s been fixed,” Tony protests weakly, but he knows this isn’t good.  He gets it now.  This isn't just bad luck or him pulling the short straw.  This is punishment.  Fury is actually out to get him.  He's pissed and so he's going to make Tony's life a living hell for a semester as revenge.Tony's always hated Nick Fury."Let me be clear, Stark," Fury continues.  "This course needs to be taught.  You are qualified.  You will teach it.  If you don't—and I know that's not going to be a problem—your funding will be cut and your research will disappear.  Am I making myself clear?"Tony swallows uncomfortably.  His research is his entire life.  And Dad's made it clear what he thinks of his only son and heir spending an extra two years at university while he dabbles in non-weapons related projects rather than coming to work for him and learning the business.  He wouldn't bail him out.  Not with this.  He can just imagine how happy he'd be to see Tony forced into coming and working for him right away."Sir—" he tries.Fury holds up a piece of paper.  "Allow me to illustrate.  You see this paper?  Let’s imagine for a second that this is your grant.  It pays for your research.  And this is what will happen to your funding if you refuse to teach this course.”  He tears the paper in half viciously.  Tony winces.  "I’m sure we can find other uses for it.""I…okay, fine.  I'll teach.  Fine.  It's just the one course, right?"Fury bares his teeth in a caricature of a smile.  "I knew you'd see it my way.""So what's the course?  Physics, Algebra, Materials?""Oh, didn't I mention?" Fury asks and by the note in his voice Tony knows it's going to be bad.  "You've just graciously volunteered to teach Statistics for the humanities.""Oh fuck no."Fury continues on like Tony hasn't even said a goddamn word.  "Class is at 10 a.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Professor Pym has been kind enough to provide you with his old lecture notes and text."Tony just stares at Fury in mute horror.  Stats.  Stats for the humanities.  He's teaching fake math to the future fast food workers of America.  He's not sure anything's worth that."Stark," Fury barks.  "What are you still doing in my office?  You want to teach another course?"Tony can't get out of there fast enough. * The walk home from campus takes Steve ten minutes.  He walks it in a daze, still unsure whether the last half-hour of his life was real.  It had to be real though, didn't it? Surely his mind couldn't have invented a class—or more specifically a professor—who was so god awful. He finds himself outside of the rundown, post-war pile of bricks that he and his three housemates call home, without really knowing how he got there.  This must be what "blinded by rage" feels like.He shoulders the door open and is greeted by Clint, who is sitting on the couch still in his pyjamas."Hey," greets Steve as he kicks off his shoes.He puts his bag down at the foot of the stairs and then collapses into the giant green oversized chair opposite Clint.  The chair had been Thor's contribution to the house in their second y
