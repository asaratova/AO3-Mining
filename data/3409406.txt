Chapter 1: Fanfiction is Fictitious. Mostly.
    


Summary:

SHIELD Recruitment Survival Tip #517 - Keep in mind that fanfiction is just that: fiction. Intimating that any of the relationships...are real, without the principles actually telling you so, is dangerous to your well-being. Especially if known SHIELD enemies are involved. Tony/Steve





Chapter Text
When Steve first heard the whispering, he ignored it. It wasn't as if he were in the middle of a presentation, and the new recruits weren't working on stealth moves, so a few words between them as they went through the training op wasn't a big deal. It annoyed him that they weren't focused, but, again, not a big deal.Besides, he had gotten used to them talking about him, so it rarely fazed him when he heard his name bandied about in their conversations with one another. It was the price he paid for being a public figure. He didn't like it - especially when people he barely knew speculated on his private life - but he dealt with it with deaf ears and bland smiles, learning that you couldn’t stop them if you wanted.And, usually, that mentality curbed his curiosity and cooled most of his ire.Until today.Today, for some reason, when he heard his name mentioned by one of the trainees, his hackles rose. Maybe there was just something in the tone of this voice or even the expression on the perpetrator’s face when he finally pinpointed them, but whatever it was, it had him seeing red once they were within earshot."And then, after he and Tony fucked, Loki used his scepter to take over Tony's body, which he then used to seduce Steve..." a light feminine voice said.Snapping instantly to attention, as he typically did when someone mentioned his boyfriend of six months, Steve frowned and concentrated so he could figure out what the masses were saying about Tony this time. Dating a former playboy, Steve had gotten used to the fact that Tony's sex life was often fodder for wild speculation. It came with the territory. And while it annoyed him to no end, he'd made peace with it; he had to or go mad, or worse, spend all his time yelling at idiots.So rumors were to be expected; but this tale was wilder than usual. Frown deepening, Steve slowly lifted his head and scanned the room, trying to pinpoint the culprits, and honed in on three recruits jogging around the track when he heard some one cut the voice off."I don't think the scepter works like that," a slim, petite brunette said, her tone dry as she stared balefully at an equally slender and petite blonde.Steve tried to place them, but they were still too far away to get a clear visual."Oh, please," their male companion snorted knowingly. "If you were expecting reality in an RPS, there is something seriously wrong. They call it fanfiction for a reason, darling. After all, look at the main pairing.""Are you going to let me continue," the blonde said, huffing when the brunette just rolled her eyes and waved her hand in the universal signal of continue."Right, so Loki infiltrated Tony's body to seduce Steve..." the male said, licking his lips as his eyes seem to glaze at the thought. Steve snorted internally. 
Don’t even think of it, pal; he’s mine.
"Yes, and while Loki was in charge of it, he discovered that Tony has secretly been in love with Steve for months, but hasn't said anything because he didn't want ruin their friendship. So, then, Loki used that to force Tony into seducing Steve and..."Steve cast the speaker an irritated look, disgust roiling in his stomach at even the idea of Loki using Tony that way, and couldn't even begin to understand why someone would read such a story. And he planned to say so himself when the narration was, thankfully, cut off by their male counterpart once more."Speak of the devil..." the male smirked, his voice dipping low."What?" the blonde huffed, obviously irritated that she'd been interrupted once more."Look who just entered," the male said, casting an appreciative glance at something over Steve's shoulder. "I have to say, no one can deny that Stark is hot."Steve arched a brow at that comment, and then glanced over his shoulder, his frown melting into a small smile when he found a grinning Tony behind him; one who’d obviously overheard that last comment given the preening. Steve just snorted and shook his head disparagingly at the brunet’s antics. Not that he disagreed, but Tony’s ego certainly did not need any extra stroking."And, Christ, have you ever seen the way he looks at the Captain? I swear he was trying to scorch his clothes off with nothing but his eyes the other day," the male continued, shooting a covetous glance their way."You know, I do get why these writers are so obsessed with the two of them as a couple; they just smolder around each other," the brunette said, watching him and Tony thoughtfully."Seriously, if they're not fucking, I'll eat my favorite..." the male continued, but Steve was done listening. Sending a now amused Tony a quelling look, Steve gave a sh
