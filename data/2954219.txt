Chapter 1: | Prologue | In the Dead of the Night
    




Chapter Text
“You’ll see John: Before the end of this night I will have proven Derek Johnson wrong. What a ridiculous story after all - a desperate try to conceal his murder. Inventing a ‘mysterious stranger who killed his enemy in exchange for his very own soul’ … did he really assume anyone would believe this fairy tale? I suppose he tries to claim insanity for lower judgement … “ Sherlock fixed his collar in a swift motion, a superior sneer on his face as he pulled a small wooden box out of his coat. Cold eyes mustering the unusual contents one last time. “Of course nobody believes him, Sherlock. And if you ask me; I don’t even understand why we have to come out here in the dead of the night just to prove him wrong! You are just enjoying this, aren’t you?” The sheer exasperation in John’s voice was quite audible, but the famous mastermind next to him didn’t seem to care at all. “Oh, yes. It particularly helps me to break through the terrible grey veil of dullness inside my mind.” Watson gave a desperate sigh when his partner bent down to bury the old cigar box. Of course, even he had to admit, that the case had been extraordinarily difficult. Their only suspect, Derek Johnson, had a bullet proof alibi and insisted on his ridiculous story: He went to a crossroad on the outskirts of London - the very same crossroad Sherlock and John were standing now - buried a small box with some personal and rather occult items and sold his soul to the devil. The devil in question being a dark haired stranger in a black suit, who appeared out of thin air and offered him his services in exchange for his immortal self. He’d kill the man who drove Johnson’s company into ruin, make his life joyous again and of top of that keep his Hands clean as a whistle. Johnson agreed to the Deal and two days later, he already read about the murder in the newspapers. John had heard of such things before - in fairy tales and old folklore, but his superstition didn’t really go far beyond that. Same for Sherlock, naturally.Yet - much to his discomfort - Sherlock insisted on visiting the mentioned crossroad at 3 bloody am to prove Johnson wrong. It must be a cruel curse to live with such an easy-bored brain like Holmes’. Once the great mastermind finished the burying, he stood up and wiped some dry dust off his clothes, facing Watson with a satisfied grin. "I told you. No strangers in black suits.” John really tried to answer - tell him how ridiculous this whole ordeal was, that he was cold and wet and annoyed - but he didn’t manage to form a single coherent word. Mainly due to the man suddenly appearing behind Sherlock. A dark haired man in a black suit. “You must be the famous Mister Sherlock Holmes?” His voice was deep, the thick accent of an Irishman seeping through every word. Sherlock barely winced. He turned around and mustered the stranger with forced calmness, taking in every inch of the expensive looking suit, up from the spotless polished shoes to the crease-free red tie around his neck. The strangers neatly shaven face was determined by a wide smirk, a superior glance in his dark eyes. For a few seconds they just stared at each other and Sherlock was the first to break the silence. “So you are the one, Mr. Johnson sold his soul? The all-famous Crossroad-demon?” His voice was dripping from sarcasm and his words caused the stranger to chuckle softly. “I heard about your principles, Mr. Holmes. Don’t believe anything unless you have seen it with your own eyes, eh?” “Obviously not,” He returned with a cold smile, “But I have to admit, this was a very impressive appearance, it’s rare that somebody can sneak up to me like this.” “Sneak up - of course. What else could it have been?” The stranger smile never wavered. John couldn’t help but shiver when his black eyes hovered over him for a second. He hadn’t sneaked up to them … and he knew, he could’ve told Sherlock. If he hadn’t suddenly lost all ability to speak, that was. “It’s a cold night Mr. Holmes so why don’t we come straight to business? You are here to prove me a fraud, if I’m correctly informed?” Sherlock shook his head, returning the same freezing smile. “Not exactly. I’m here to prove you a murderer who also happens to be a fraud.” “I see...so if you want to do so, why don’t we make a deal?” The expression in the Strangers eyes became more calculating now, the glance of a business man about to reel in the client of the year. “Let’s make a deal Mr. Holmes. If I’m a fraud as you assume -” “I don’t assume. I know it.” “Of course you do. If I’m a fraud you don’t have to fear for your petty little soul. And if I am not... well you don’t have the appearance of a man who does not trust in his own knowledge.” Sherlock nodded shortly, the superior smile never fading from his lips.  “So what would I get in exchange?” He asked, playing along in the stranger’s game. “Sherlock, are you sure that’s a good idea… ” John finally found hi
