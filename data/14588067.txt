It starts when Tony’s young.There’s something in Howard’s basement laboratory that calls to him.It  hums, a low vibrato that sits just there on the edge of his senses until he  feels it more than simply hears it.  It slips into his dreams at night, into his every waking thought even though he’s too young to really understand what’s happening.Too young and naive despite all of his genius to realize that what's happening isn’t  normal.Even at such a young age curiosity has always been his guiding sin so it’s only a matter of time really before Tony sneaks downstairs to find out what it is.There’s something sitting on one of Howard’s lab tables.  It’s something Tony has never seen before, a  cube  of some sort that shines bright and brilliant and oh so  blue.Eyes wide, heart pounding in his chest, Tony moves closer, clenching his hands on the side of the table and straining up on his tiptoes to get a better look.He’s never seen anything so  beautiful in all of his short life.~~~Tony spends hours down there in the workshop while Jarvis is busy and Howard’s away or passed out drunk in his study.Spends hours just …  staring while the cube hums at him, a soft lovely sort of lullaby that makes him sway slightly in place where he’s sitting cross legged on the table beside it.It reminds him, vaguely, of the rapidly fading memory of his  Madre humming lightly to him in their secret language, the one she tells him not to let Howard, Sir, hear him speak.Tony’s five and a half and he … he misses those times with an  ache  his little chest can barely contain.  Misses the days when  Madre would smile at him, when she didn’t smell like sherry and didn’t have a row of pill bottles on her vanity.The soft, curious sort of whispering that comes from The Cube as Tony calls it in his head, is a comfort of sorts.So, eventually, lonely and heartsick, Tony starts to whisper back.~~~“I’m Tony Stark,” Tony whispers to the Cube and has to close his eyes as the hum that he feels in the back of his head ramps up a notch until he can practically feel it vibrating in his bones.In the end Tony whispers his secrets to the Cube because he  knows it will never tell anyone else.  He tells it his dreams, his wants, his wildest little boy fantasies.And then, when the hum grows louder after every visit, after every secret shared, he tells it even more.He tells it about Jarvis, about his  Madre, about every little thing or thought that crosses his mind.He even tells it about his circuit board, the one Sir broke and Tony had to rebuild better and better before he’d finally stopped breaking them.Then one night after a long day of  lessons, eyes swollen and red, Tony tells it in a slightly ashamed whisper about wanting to build planes and computers and robot dogs instead of guns and missiles and tanks.How he wants to build, to create, to protect, instead of dismantle, destroy, and attack.A week later and he tells it, bloody lip still stinging, the first time Howard raises a hand to him.~~~Tony talks to the Cube for a year, whispers to it every chance he gets and goes to sleep at night with its blue glow and vibrating hum seeping into his dreams.Constellations wheel around in Tony’s mind at night, illuminating his sleep with the beauty of a supernova, the terrible gaping hunger of black holes, the whimpering cry of a nebula as it births new stars into creation.All of Space laid out for him to marvel at.Tony learns and learns and learns and then he creeps downstairs and babbles relentlessly to his first and only friend.All the while the Cube  hums, just a bit smug, just a bit loving, and shows him  more.~~~Howard catches him eventually, because of course he does.And the beating Tony carries hurts less than the way he never sees the Cube again, than the way Howard whisks it away in the night and never brings it back to the mansion.But, gone or not, Tony never forgets it, never forgets his first friend or its brilliant blue glow and all of the mysteries it had contained.~~~Years later, an ocean of blood on his hands and the arc reactor in his chest, Tony can’t help but think that the blue glow of it is close but not exactly  right.~~~And then, years after that, Tony stands in the top of his Tower, his own personal ladder to the stars, and holds a hologram of the Tesseract in his hand.The familiar, perfect, blue glow illuminates the room around him and Tony feels his heart skip a beat.“Hello, old friend,” Tony whispers to the projection as awe and then determination roar through him.  “Don’t worry now, I’m gonna find you.”~~~Loki’s scepter calls for him too, in that same way the Cube, the Tesseract, had when he was young.Well, almost the same.  The call is similar but the tone, the flavor, is …  different.This, whatever it is, is a bit wilder, a bit more self aware and absolutely  vicious.When Tony finds himself on the helicarrier in one of the labs as Rogers insults him, Tony feels it flare to life in the back of his mind.  He feels the way it l
