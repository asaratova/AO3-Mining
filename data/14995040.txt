Chapter Text
“Tony?” Bucky calls out from the elevator. FRIDAY had let him up because no one could find Tony for the stress tests that were scheduled. He hears a noise from one of the bathrooms and quietly makes his way over to the door and pushes it open.Loki is there looking pale and he's shivering slightly. His skin is covered in sweat and there's vomit clinging to the corner of his mouth from where he's leaning over the toilet.“You okay there Hamlet?” Bucky asks kneeling down beside him using tie to keep Loki's hair back.“I am not feeling well. I fear that I have caught some Midgardian affliction and I am starting to understand why you mortal are so short-lived,” Loki says before throwing up in the toilet again.“Where are your husbands?” Bucky asks worried that something had happened to them.“Rhodey’s visiting his mother. He won't be back until Monday. Quill had to head to work early this morning so he didn't know. Stephen took Peter and Harley to school and then he has to go train some young sorcerers. Tony and Bruce are out getting me every sort of stomach remedy your healers have ever brewed,” Loki says and slowly sucks in a breath and stands a little shakily at first and Bucky helps him back into bed.“You should lie back. I don't know what the hell this is but if it's strong enough to mess up a god then you need your rest,” Bucky says.“I am fine Bucky. Already I can feel the strength returning to my body,” Loki says and while he still looks pale he can see the color returning to his face.“Huh that's weird. I've seen something like this before. My mother used to get sick in the mornings. It lasted for a while before finally stopping when…” Bucky trails off wided eyed.“When what?” Loki asks.“When my little sister was born... you're...you can't be... you're a man...wait... you're a shapeshifter... I...okay...wow... you're pregnant,” Bucky says and has to sit in the edge of the bed when his knees feel like they're going to buckle.“Yes, I am. I haven't told my husbands yet. I want them all to be here when I do,” Loki says.“Wait...how are you already having morning sickness? That doesn't happen for a while yet,” Bucky says.“Asgardian pregnancies last for four months and Jotunn pregnancies last for six. Meaning the symptoms show earlier. I do not know which model I fall under yet since I am in an Asgardian form but am biologically Jotunn,” Loki says.“How the fuck are you supposed to give birth? How the fuck are you carrying a baby?” Bucky asks.“I could either have what mortals call a C-section or shift my shape to fully female. As I said. I am Jotunn biologically. They are intersex meaning I have all the necessary... squishy parts, as Tony calls them...to carry and birth a child,” Loki says.“Do you know whose it is?”“Does it matter?”“Medically maybe. I know that Stevie used to have to worry about passing his health issues to his kids he might have to worry about that even now but he isn't inclined to get anyone pregnant right now. I'm not a doctor so I have no idea if they have anything that can be passed to the baby,” Bucky says.“I am working on spells to manipulate the babies health it make sure they are completely healthy,” Loki says.“They?”“I am only manipulating the child's health. I am leaving all other factors to chance,” Loki says.“Okay, that's good. As long as the sprouts healthy. I don't thing the others will mind not knowing,” Bucky says as he hears the elevator open.“Promise you will speak of this to no one until I say?” Loki asks quietly.“Of course,” Bucky says and stands just before Tony and Bruce come in.“Oh, hey Bucky. Were you keeping an eye in Elphaba for me?” Tony asks.“Yes. I was looking for you and I heard him in distress so I kept an eye on him,” Bucky says.“Thanks, sorry but no work today. Loki needs me here,” Tony says smiling down at Loki who smiles up at him.“Well I'll let the patient rest,” Bucky says and goes to leave.“Oh, Bucky!” Loki calls.“Thank you,” Loki says when Bucky turns and Bucky smiles at him.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXFRIDAY, contrary to what certain people believe about AIs is a lot more than a bunch of code. She cares for her father and anyone whom he cares about.Which is why, when she detected a minor shift in Loki's vitals she examined the problem.According to protocol she's technically supposed to alert her father of any changes in his guest's changes. The protocol telling her to make the alert more urgent when one of those guests is also his husband.But Loki, out of all her step-fathers, has always had an acute awareness when it comes to his vitals.So, she ignores protocol but still scans him without anyone knowing, silently thanking JARVIS for sneaking biometric sensors into every area where father goes to avoid medical attention.At first she's not sure what she's reading. Father didn't program her with extensive medical knowledge, just enough to note extreme ch
