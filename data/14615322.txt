Peter knew Wade’s name, his home address, and his roommate. He knew the guy started with guns before he went to swords and that his semi-sort of-best friend was a skinny man who every mercenary in the city was perpetually ready to throw down for.So when Wade got the living shit kicked out of him in Peter’s place trying to take down an arms dealer with a taste for human trafficking, Peter knew right away that the giant realistic otter plush they sold downtown would make his shitty day slightly less shitty.Wade christened it Money Penny and lovingly draped plastic Mardi Gras beads around her neck. Standing under the florescent lights at CVS with a bottle of Fanta in one hand and a vast assortment of get-well soon cards in front of him, he realized that he knew next to nothing about Double D. And that was pretty messed up given that one time he’d taken Peter and May’s tenancy case against their landlord pro bono.When she came back from court, May told him that Matt Murdock Esq. was more terrifying than Daredevil any day of the week, which Peter figured was supposed to be a compliment. She hadn’t seen Double D put down a gang of fifteen guys by himself, though, so Peter kept his mouth shut.   Peter was putting away groceries with May when his phone rang. He froze in front of the fridge upon seeing the contact name. He couldn’t answer fast enough. There was no voice on the other side, just the sound of flesh meeting armor, over and over, and harsh breathing. The guy hitting Red was puffing furiously. There was a loud clatter as the phone hit the ground. Peter told Double D to ‘hold on, just hold on,” and grabbed his computer to track the call. By the time he and Wade got to where the phone was, Red was gone. His helmet was laying on the ground, shining in the street lights.It was soaked with blood.They spent the following hours looking for a body in dumpsters, under trash, in sewers. They found him at the docks, soaked through, lips blue, still half in the water. He looked much younger without the helmet or the glasses. He didn’t open his eyes when Wade hauled him out and over to check his breathing.He was breathing, but not well. They tried to wake him up, but it wasn’t happening. Peter wanted to take him to a hospital, but Wade said no, people like them didn’t usually do hospitals. He asked Peter if he knew where Red lived and he didn’t, he only knew where his office was.Wade’s blatant disregard for personal boundaries proved useful; he started rummaging through all of Red’s pockets, shoving hands in between the gaps in his soaked armor and frisking the guy’s bottom half like a pro. He came up with the billy club and then a waterlogged phone, a nicer one than the one they’d found smashed behind the warehouse. By some miracle, it turned on. Wade wrapped it in a cloth he kept to keep his guns dry, did something complicated that bypassed the lock screen, and scrolled through Red’s contacts.“Which one should I call?” Wade asked. Peter took the phone, it had a different interface from the one he was used to and with a twist in his diaphragm he realized it was because Red had all of the accessibility options on. This was probably his personal phone. Peter instinctively opened the message app, then opened the text conversation at the top of the list.Foggy: It’s Karen’s birthday tomorrow. I’m putting whiskey in a prosecco bottle for her and I need your freakish knowledge of cork. How do you convincingly re-seal champagne?Me: You start by conceding that it will not pop the way you are thinking it will because there is no carbonation.Foggy: Or you can just be fucking rude about it I guess.“I think this one,” Peter told Wade, holding out the phone to give it back, “They seem pretty close.”Wade tapped the call button and then the speaker button and Peter prayed that the water wouldn’t get to the inside the phone before the guy picked up. They waited. It was 3am, and Peter was terrified that the guy would just sleep through the call. The call dropped. Wade dialed again as soon as the last beep sounded; he waved at Peter to make sure Red was still breathing. He was making a soft wheezing noise.“Hello?” a groggy voice finally answered, and Peter thanked God. And fuck. And anyone else who was out there.“Hello?” Wade said, “Is this, uh, Foggy?” There was a shuffle on the other side of the phone as Foggy sat up.“Yeah, this is Foggy. Who the fuck is this? Why do you have Matt’s phone?”“This is Deadpool, and we just fished him out of the docks. He’s actively dying, but I get the feeling he isn’t the hospital type. You know where we can take him?”They heard a curse, but then Foggy didn’t even miss a beat. He rattled off an address and told them he’d meet them there with someone who could help. He told them to go through the roof access into the place, it should be unlocked. He shouted “Matt, you stupid fucker, don’t die until I get there to kill you,” and hung up.Wade ended the call and looked down at Red sympathetically
