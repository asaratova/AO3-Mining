Chapter 1: Hemorrhage (Assassin's Creed)
    




Chapter Text
Altaïr awoke to voices in a language he did not understand. A sharp spike of confusion registered briefly—hadn’t he just been running across rooftops in Jerusalem?—before it was discarded in favor of more pressing matters. There was a female voice to his right, sounding lighthearted and easygoing; a direct contrast to the sarcastic, nearly-snarling male voice from across the room—room? Hadn’t he just been outside?—and the irritated female one from between them.His armor felt strange, and as he slit his eyes open just enough to observe but not be observed he became aware that his hood was missing. These people could see his face! Instinctively he flexed his wrist and was reassured by the comforting weight of his hidden blade, even if his other weapons seemed to have been taken. Why did they leave him with his blade if they had taken his swords and daggers?He shifted his eyes to the right as they gleamed molten gold, his Other sight shivering into place like ripples of water. The friendly female glowed a reassuring blue, as did the angry male across the floor. The other female, however, glowed a sharp, angry red.Enemy, was all that Altaïr registered before he was tensing his muscles in preparation to leap. He didn’t know who his two allies were, or why they hadn’t attacked the enemy yet, but Altaïr would not allow his comrades—possible brother and sister—to be deceived by this obvious traitor. Why else would they be conversing with the enemy—a Templar?—unless they didn’t know of the true threat? Altaïr steadied his breathing and slowly peeled his eyes open, wrist tensing and ready to unsheathe his blade the moment the traitor drew close enough to——Desmond awoke with a gasp, sitting upright on the animus and feeling like a bucket of ice water had just been poured down his back. He looked around wildly, feeling oddly disconnected from reality in a manner reminiscent of the Bleeding Effect, only a thousand times worse.His Eagle Vision flickered on and off like a broken switch, casting the others into various shades of color too quickly for him to catch. He grimaced and pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes to try and ease some of the pressure gathering there, and when he looked up and blinked a few times he could have sworn Lucy flashed red for a moment before slowly turning blue again.Strange, Desmond wondered dazedly. For a second it almost looked like…He shook his head and swung his legs over the side of the animus. Obviously the Bleeding Effect was putting his Eagle Vision on the fritz. Lucy was an Assassin just like the rest of them—hell she’d rescued him from Abstergo!—and there was no way she would show up red under other circumstances, he was sure.But he couldn’t stop himself from keeping his distance from her, or from feeling unusually wary about everything she said and did for the rest of the night. 
 Altaïr blinked, momentarily confused before ingrained reflex took over and he swung back around the corner he’d apparently just rounded—but, no, that’s not right at all, he was in Masyaf walking through the Gardens—and pressed his back to the strange wall found there. Gold eyes flicked around the narrow corridor, not recognizing the materials used in its construction. The lines were too smooth; there was no brickwork or thatch, no stone or wood. There were no inconsistencies in the surfaces to act as handholds or scaffolding to gain access to higher ground.Altaïr didn’t like this. He didn’t like this at all.Remembering the last time he’d awoken in a strange, unfamiliar place, he quickly glanced down at himself and cursed under his breath. Again, he had been stripped of his armor and most of his weapons save his hidden blade and put in these odd, loose garments that were entirely unsuitable for protecting his flesh from Templar steel.Altaïr paused, looking back down at his blade. There was something different about it. About the blade itself. About his hand. Something wasn’t right. He flexed the fingers—all five of them—on his weapon hand, confusion mounting——Desmond blinked back a flash of dizziness, finding himself leaning up against a wall near the animus room. He must have blacked out for a second; he was awfully tired thanks to all the time spent in the animus running around Renaissance Italy.Shoving himself off the wall he continued towards the others, glancing down at his hidden blade and unsheathing it a few times, disquieted.Why did it feel like something was wrong with his hand? 
 Altaïr found himself staring into the face of the sarcastic male from before, the one who glowed blue after an eye-blink of Other sight to check, between one step and the next. More prepared this time, he quickly and surreptitiously flexed the fingers on his left hand—he had not imagined having all of his fingers then—and carefully schooled his expression into a blank mask. He did not know what the male was saying, where he was, why his hand had an extra
