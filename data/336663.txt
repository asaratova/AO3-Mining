Natasha is the first person SHIELD introduces him to. She’s cool, collected, and at the end of the day, Russian. Captain America means little to her; she’s more interested in Captain Rogers.Steve figures that she’s probably reporting on him to Director Fury, but at least she teaches him how to knife fight and explains what a frappuccino is. Steve, he discovers, likes them when they’re made with caramel and have those little sugar bits on top. Natasha only drinks her coffee black, but her face softens when he gets whipped cream on his nose.In between the mandatory training sessions and psych evals, Natasha and Steve become friends. They talk about art and architecture and food, and Steve remembers that he’s more than solitude and war and snow.  Steve meets Clint next, but he suspects that’s an accident. Natasha’s sparring with someone already when he gets to the gym (late, thanks to yet another surprise psych eval. They’re all so worried about him). She pins the man with ease, and he smiles, calls her beautiful, asks if she’d like to smack him around some more. Steve has seen Natasha break a man’s nose for less (it had been a bad week), but she just smiles and helps him up.He’s introduced to Steve as Clint Barton, codename Hawkeye. “Don’t tell Coulson I was here, I’m not technically off bed rest yet,” he says. He has a cocksure grin and broad shoulders.Clint seems similarly unconcerned with Steve’s status as an American icon. Natasha explains that Clint only cares about two things in the world, but doesn’t say what. Steve’s just happy to have people around him who don’t think of him as a ticking time bomb of mental instability.  (“That’s because we’re in the same boat, buddy,” Clint says one night after a few beers, “The best assets are the ones with shady pasts and steady hands. Besides, those Captain America cartoons were always so fucking boring. You’re way better man.”Steve does his best not to blush.)  The meeting with the rest of the Avengers happens all at once, thanks to Loki’s sudden desire for revenge. It does not go so well. Thor thinks Steve’s some sort of demigod and Tony thinks that he’s just a trussed up piece of propaganda. Bruce is reserved in a way that makes Steve uneasy.Fury tells them that he doesn’t care about their petty bullshit, that they are all here to fight the good fight so shut up and go to work, Clint would you stop trying to sneak up on me, for the love of God, I will assign you to desk work.  (“No he won’t,” Clint tells Steve later, trying to get Steve’s mind of Howard Stark and the past, “He knows that I’m only going to more of a distraction then. Confine me to a desk and I’m just going to go find Coulson. Without him, man, the whole Initiative falls apart.”)  As people, it takes time to get to know each other.As teammates, they figure it out pretty fast. The field isn’t the place for drama, and familiarity is borne from necessity. Steve knows that friendship will come with time.  Eventually Bruce opens up, begins to trust the Avengers more, begins to trust himself more. He introduces them to Betty and lets Steve hang out in his lab.Thor and Steve eventually reach a middle ground of understanding. It’s easy enough to bond with the only other person out of their depths as well (although Steve suspects out of time is far easier than out of place). Together they figure out the internet and cell phones and get conned by Darcy into getting spray tans.He can’t quite figure out how to be friends with Tony. They seem to rub each other in all the wrong ways. Tony, at first, reminds Steve of Howard and, in turn, of all the people he’s lost. Steve seems to remind Tony of Howard as well, although Steve’s not really sure of what that means.  “Just ignore him,” is Natasha’s advice, “Tony Stark is an unstable man-child.”Clint nods soundly, “Play hard to get, man. Tony’s got ladies throwing themselves at him all day long. What he wants is a challenge.”“I’m trying to work with the guy, not sleep with him,” Steve says, taken aback.Clint just grins, “Just giving you some friendly advice from a guy who knows a thing or two.”Natasha, in an unusual display of emotion (although Steve is starting to expect that Clint and Natasha are each other’s exceptions in most things), rolls her eyes, “Ignore both of them, Steve. Clint knows more about relationships than Tony Stark does, but Clint once gave me dynamite for a birthday present.”  (It takes a while, but eventually Steve figures out that Clint and Natasha are no longer together, although he has no idea when that ship sailed.He still hasn’t figured out things with Tony though.)  Tony takes it too far one day, after a mission gone bad. Asks what good Steve is, besides a relic of America’s past. Says that he doesn’t need the Avengers. Says that he doesn’t play well with others.Steve wants to know what hurt him so badly. Wants to tell him that Howard was many things, but Steve never thought that he should be a father. Instead he calls Tony ou
