Tony knows how he is going to die.It isn’t going to be splattered against the sidewalk from a mission gone wrong. It isn’t going to be from a failing liver (he didn’t really drink that much) or a laboratory explosion (those were usually pre-planned purely for the joy of watching Steve get that constipated look on his face) or of old age (because there was no way he was making it that long--he’d already used up 25 of his nine cat lives).He is going to die from Not Breathing.It didn’t used to be a Problem. It had been a problem, but not a Problem. Not until After.There had been instances before, but they were minor compared to the After.Before Not Breathing had been more of a not breathing. (There had been him, seven years old and gasping as his father looked down on him, his mother crying, and after that he stayed away when his father was smoking and it really wasn’t an issue). Before it was easily taken care of with standard treatments, labeled mild, and controlled, and the only real ‘flare’ had been when he was twenty and had pneumonia and had been hooked up to oxygen and chest tubes and things that just weren’t fun.But that was just once (and maybe a few more times--once when he tried to run a marathon) but it had never been like this.Not until After.After there was this thing in his chest (this thing that glowed and kept him alive and that he couldn’t keep from touching at least once every half-an-hour just to make sure that it was still there, and warm, and working) that went too deep and too wide and sat where pieces of his ribs and lungs once had (protecting him) and keeping the little metal bits that were trying to tear him to shreds from continuing to rip through his lungs and into his heart (and as if this thing wasn’t enough, those little metal bits, shrapnel, were littered through his chest, putting scar tissue into places where it just didn’t need to be).The thing was heavy and tight and it kept him alive. But it also made him Not Breathe. (And really, his lungs had been the traitor to begin with, but they hadn’t been this bad, hadn’t refused so absolutely to cooperate with the rest of him).There was a constant zipper in his chest, soft and whistling, and if he talked fast enough, loud enough, than he couldn’t hear it and for a second (or maybe two) he could pretend he was really Breathing, not doing this sort of whistle, skip, gasp, thing that kept oxygen flowing to his already abused heart.And when he couldn’t, on days where he just couldn’t talk fast enough or loud enough and they might hear, might realize that he was Not Breathing and just pretending, those were the days (weeks) that he locked himself in his lab to work, Jarvis pumping oxygen enriched air through the room. Days where it was really bad (the days where he didn’t need to hide the whistle-wheeze because he couldn’t even get enough air to whistle-wheeze) he locked everyone out of the lab, pulled down the curtains, ignored the shouts, the pounding, and curses, and curled up on the worn leather couch wrapped in his blanket (the one he liked to hold under his nose when he really couldn’t Breathe, as if somehow it would help) and his nebulizer, watching classics like My Fair Lady, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and The Wizard of Oz (things he would have watched with his mother, when he was little and couldn’t breathe, and she’d sit with him and stroke his head and not point out how bad he was at breathing--good thing she couldn’t see him now). He’d fall asleep to Jarvis’ quiet commentary through the movies and if he was lucky he’d wake up and would be able to Not Breathe.Tony had learned all the little tricks to keep his Not Breathing just Not Breathing and not NOT BREATHING (like not thinking about standing water, because do you know how hard it is for an asthmatic with a car battery to make it through water boarding--but if he could make it through that, then he should be able to handle a little cigar smoke). He drank lots of black coffee (caffeine helped keep his airway open--it also kept him from thinking about water, and deserts, and this thing in his chest), took scalding showers (could ease a tight whistle to a wet wheeze if he was lucky), used his daily inhalers (they were hard to hide), and his rescue one (he hadn’t found a way to use that in the suit--and he really needed to, he really, really needed to), and his nebulizer at night when it wasn’t enough, and when it was really bad, really, really, really bad, he had an oxygen tank safely hidden away (and he reserved that for when everything else hadn’t worked--for days he flew nukes through the atmosphere and into different dimensions).So he was going to die from Not Breathing (because that was all he did was Not Breathe now) and no one would know (not even Pepper or Rhodey) because he hadn’t told them before, and he wasn’t talking about it After.And it might just be today.Today the suit felt like a coffin, closed tight and pressing close. He knew it was bad
