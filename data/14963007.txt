Bucky leaves Avengers compound at six AM every Saturday morning. He knows that if Steve knew where he was going he'd insist on going with him. But, this isn't something Steve has a say in. Yes he's Bucky's best friend but Bucky decides who touches and works on his body.He's just lucky that Stark is willing to take a look at his arm now that he's in New York. The trip back and forth to Wakanda is exceeding long even with the advanced ship.Besides Shuri should be able to go back to improving her own personal tech and her country’s tech. Not worrying about a semi-stable hundred year old man.He arrives at the tower at precisely twelve. Tony is usually waiting in the lobby. But this time he's not there. “Ummm Ms. Barton? Did Tony not want me to come over today?” Bucky asks the woman quietly. He'd never been this shy with people but he feels he needs to do everything possible to ease people's fears of him.“I'm not sure. Today is a little weird because of the charity event. Why don't you head up to the penthouse. He's added you to the list of people allowed access,” she says with a smile.“Thank you ma'am... but I don't think he'd want me just bursting in there,” Bucky says softly.“There you are, perfect timing. Tell Mr. Barnes that it's okay for him to go up to the penthouse,” she says as on of the kids walks in.“Oh sure. Dad doesn't mind,” the one known as Peter says and practically drags Bucky towards the elevator. “How are you so damn strong?” Bucky asks.“I... I… work out a lot,” he says.“Kid, I know you're the web guy from the airport. You're secret is safe with me. Unlike Stevie I know what secrets to keep and which to tell,” Bucky says.“Oh...okay... well I swing from those webs. So, I have to be strong enough to support my body weight besides spiders are several times stronger than they look. So are their web,” the kid says and they exit into the penthouse to find Stephen, Quill, Loki, Bruce, and Rhodey standing around in extremely nice suits that make Bucky feel self conscious in his hoodie and jeans. He finally notices Tony draped dramatically over the loveseat sighing. He too is wearing a suit that looks like it costs more than Bucky's whole closet but Bucky doesn't mind too much. That suit put put money in the pockets and food in the bellies of all the people involved in making it. Besides he knows that Tony checks out every company he buys from. So, no dirty labor practices today. So, who is Bucky to judge?“Darling, you look stunning. Everyone at the party will be envious,” Loki says.“You're my husband! You have to say that! I look old!” He hears Tony groan.“What about me? I'm under no obligation to you and I think you look better than all your husbands combined,” Bucky decides to say. It's definitely not a lie. Tony looks amazing and if Bucky can make him feel better after everything Tony's done for him than so be it.“Oh shit. Thanks for the compliment. I'm sorry I forgot that we were supposed to work on your arm today. I should have called,” Tony says shooting upright.“It's fine. The upgrade you did last time will hold up for... probably longer than I'll be alive,” Bucky says with a shrug.“Still, I know you walk all the way here because of the lack of funding for gas money,” Tony says but Bucky holds up his hand.“I'm not Stevie. I'm not going to make you discuss Avenger things,” Bucky says and Tony smiles.“Thanks. I can see why Rogers likes you,” Tony says.“So, what's with the monkey suits?” Bucky asks.“There's a fundraising event for the Maria Stark Foundation. Also a meet and greet for some of the heroes around New York to hear and talk to their people. We can't improve of we don't know where we suck,” Tony says.“Stevie mentioned something about that. He said it was just some stupid accords thing,” Bucky says.“Of course he did. Do you want to come? It’ll look better in the press if at least some of you are there. Hope is dragging Scott and Laura is bringing Clint. They're finally coming around,” Tony says.“Yeah. They had the most to lose out of the people on Stevie’s side. I think they're finally realizing that he was wrong. I'd like to show my support but I don't have a fancy suit and I don't think it would be appropriate for me to go to a Maria Stark Foundation event, for obvious reasons,” Bucky says.“I'm her son. If I want you there no one has any right to send you away. Besides, I never told the public about it,” Tony says.“And as for the suit I can always alter one of Quill’s magically,” Loki says.“You really don't mind me being there?” Bucky asks.“No. I'd prefer you there. Maybe by showing that your team is willing to work with the people we can get you guys some funding,” Tony says.“Natasha was talking about going to some guy named Justin Hammer, but he's currently a felon so Stevie said no. Which is weird because we're technically nearly felons. He was thinking of going to Apple or Sony,” Bucky says.“Big companies like Apple won't touch your team with a ten foot pole. You guys woul
