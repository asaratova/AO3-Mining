Chapter 1





Chapter Text
xThe one time Erik sees Raven's brother is when he is picking her up in front of a restaurant downtown. He is startlingly beautiful standing there with the sunlight dancing off his unruly hair, lighting up cornflower eyes and a warm smile.It's enough.His name is Charles. Raven's not quick to volunteer more information than that, just like she probably didn't tell her brother whose car it is she routinely gets into. Erik can appreciate this as it comes with their business; giving away personal information is always risky, even when it is in front of allies.Raven is an important asset and that alone would usually make him think twice about entertaining the thoughts he's entertaining.But.Raven sees him often, they're close it seems. Erik watches them, for moments at a time, unseen, hunger nagging at him.He beds numerous people, people with dull hearts and sharp edges, with hard eyes just like his. And goes to sleep and wakes up to the thought of that ridiculous floppy hair and those cardigans that scream teaching assistant.He denies himself...and craves and craves until the thoughts start to bleed into his work, all-consuming.It simply will not do.He changes tactics.
