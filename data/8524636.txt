Chapter 1





Chapter Text
People say that you never are given situations in your life that you can’t deal with. No obstacle is too strong and that uplifting bullshit.None of them had ever met Toni Stark.When Rhodey had woken up in the hospital after taking the hit from the beam Vision had tried to use to bring down the Falcon (it is never going to be Sam or even Wilson to him now), with a somber looking Phil Coulson in the room he knew something had gone wrong, absolutely wrong. He had questioned him immediately, wondering where the hell Toni was, and knowing the brunette would never abandon him to the pain of waking up alone as she had in Afghanistan. The agent had tried to skirt around the issue, refute all of his efforts to know the location of his tiny genius companion, but Rhodey had persisted.Now he wished he hadn’t.He hadn’t believed the agent when he first told him the news, thinking that the man was playing some mean joke. He hadn’t believed Hill either when she came in and confirmed the story. He hadn’t believed anyone.That is till he saw Pietro.When he had first met the guy, during the Ultron mess, he hadn’t known what to think. Yes he was pissed at the male twin for his helping the enemy and trying to kill the one person Rhodey would die to protect, but he could somewhat see the reasoning. After hearing the story, he cursed Stane to the deepest parts of hell which was something he hadn’t done in a long time. So he had no problem with the guy, unlike his unstable sister who had tried to drive his genius mad.Quicksilver had been sitting against the wall that was connected to the door to the morgue. His blonde hair was in tangles and dark circles framed his lifeless eyes. He wore simple sweats an old band t-shirt that he recognized. He had gotten it at a concert years ago and it had been stolen by Toni sometime during his stay in the mansion after his massive screw up that led to him becoming War Machine.“I found her.” he whispered after Rhodey had dragged him to get some food at the SHIELD cafeteria.The simple statement made the soldier’s blood run cold, realizing that Pietro was confirming the truth that everyone had been telling him.The blonde let out a humorless laugh. “She told me a few months ago, when this thing was breaking out, that she had a feeling it was gonna come down to her or Steve. She couldn’t stop with Ross breathing down her neck. Rogers was too stubborn to stop and listen for once in his life. She knew with the way things were going it was gonna come down to the two of them.”Running a hand through the mess of his hair, Pietro continued. “She told me that she was going to do her best to come back but she was not going to hurt Steve. If it came down to only one of them surviving, she stated that it wasn’t going to be her. Then she made me promise after her funeral to make sure the new Accords were instated and that Ross was behind bars with his life in shambles. She wanted him alive though, wanted him to live with the knowledge that she had taken everything. She wanted him to be an example to what happens to people who mess with her family. She didn’t need to make me swear it; especially after she riled him up into smacking her across the face so hard she hit the ground.”He felt his eyes go wide. “He what?”The Sokovian nodded. “After you went down she found out the truth about Barnes’ psychiatrist. She knew Ross knew more than he let on and she needed more information before she could interrogate Wilson and get Rogers’ location. Add that she was pissed about the RAFT and wanted to get physical assault on the other list of offences she had against him…”The picture painted in Rhodey’s mind as he realized what she had done. “She riled him up to get him to act rashly.”Pietro nodded. “I got the whole thing on video and had FRIDAY add it to the file she had on him. T’Challa and I were going to take him to court in a few weeks. I can’t make myself do it now, not with it being so soon since…”He trailed off, his eyes glassing over in memories. “How?” Rhodey whispered, knowing he didn’t need to elaborate on what knowledge he needed.The younger man nodded. “Ross knew Rogers and Barnes were headed to Siberia and was planning on sending some assassins after them. He let it slip out under his breath as Toni and I were leaving the room after he hit her. She went to Wilson and ended up finding out that HYDRA had more soldiers frozen in their old base, which is where Steve and Bucky were headed. She made repairs on the suit and made sure your leg braces,” he pointed to the black contraptions on attached to his pants, “were done before she left.”Pietro was silent, taking a deep breath before continuing. “Right around the time she made it to the base, FRIDAY went ahead and told us to head out. She didn’t think it was gonna go well. To start off, she was wrong. Toni was able to get Rogers to listen for a minute and told him she was gonna help with the soldiers. They stood down, and they all went to
