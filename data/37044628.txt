Chapter 1: Melinda
    




Chapter Text
She stepped into the cold windy streets of New York City and shivered.  “Yeah, so, he says he wants to meet you and that you seem awesome.”“I’ve heard that before.” I commented, “Maria, I’m not going on a date with your colleague.”“But-,”“Uh-uh. You are not interfering with my love life. I have work to do instead of listening to you name every man you know.” She sighed, “Look, Maria, I appreciate it. I really do. Just - I just need more time after-,”“Yeah, no, I get it. Don’t worry. But you’re still visiting this weekend, right?”“This weekend?”Maria sighed, “Melinda. My friend’s party. She invited you.” “I barely know her, though.” Melinda complained. “Well, you’ll get to know her when you see her.”She groaned, “I hate you.”“Nah, you love me. Now, I’ll call you later and please pick up the damn phone when I do. I worry.”“Okay, mom.” Melinda smirked and ended the call.She settled into her car and turned the radio on. xxxxShe pulled into her designated parking spot at the FBI office and got out of the car. Her phone vibrated and she pulled it out to see a message from her boss.“Meet me in my office before you join the others.”She sighed and rubbed her temple, “Ok.” She texted back.xxxxShe knocked on the door before entering his office.“Hello, Melinda.”“It’s Agent May. Sir.”“Agent May.”“What’s this about? I have places to be.”“Ah, okay. Let’s get to it.” She nodded, “I’m retiring. And I need an agent to take the job.” She nodded, “I said you.” He grinned but she just stared at him.“You’re offering me your job position.” Melinda stated. “Well, not offering. But it’s a really nice position.”“Uh, thank you - thank you, sir.”“Of course.” He smiled, “Also, uh, I was wondering if you’re free this weekend.”‘Oh shit’ Melinda thought before she quickly covered the frown with a smile, “Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. I, uh, I have dinner with a friend.”“Oh. Okay. Maybe next weekend or some other time?”“Uh, I don’t think so. I have a lot of plans for the next 40 years.”He nodded and frowned, “Ok. Uh, sorry I asked. That was unprofessional of me.”
“No, it’s fine. Not your fault.” She smiled and excused herself from the office.xxxxx“Hey, Garner.”“Oh, hey!” The man chirped from behind the huge screen on his desk, “Is everything okay?”“Uh,” She sighed and locked their office door, “Mace offered me his position.” She anxiously bit her bottom lip.His face beamed, “Congrats!” He jumped up from his chair and wrapped his arms around the Asian woman. “Uh, thanks.” She awkwardly stood there, “Could you stop hugging me now?” She patted the man’s back. “Right.” The man pulled away and softly smiled at her, “Sorry.”She shook her head and lifted the side of her mouth, “It’s fine.”She smiled at the man and went ahead to finish paperwork.xxxxShe settled onto the couch with a takeout container and a glass of wine. She scrolled through the TV channels and stopped at the new movie that was streaming at the time.
Suddenly, her phone rang, “Hey, mom.” She sighed. “Qiaolian.” “Why are you calling me?” “I can’t call my daughter now?”“That’s not what I meant.”Lian May sighed, “Are you free this weekend?”“My friend’s son wants to meet you.”“Then, no.” She dryly replied, “Maria’s friend invited me to dinner.”“And no suitors there?”“No, mom.” At least, none that she knew of, “It’s just Maria, me, her friend, and her friend’s husband.”“Well, G’night, Melinda.”“Night, mom.”She hung up and wrapped the patterned throw around her body.She sipped her wine and just stared at the TV screen in confusion, ‘Wait, Walter. Don’t forget your umbrella.’ The woman on TV winked.Melinda scrunched her eyebrows, “Huh.” She frowned, “It’s not even raining!”She shook her head and gulped the last of her wine, “Time to go to bed.” She mumbled under her breath. Her gaze landed on the closed door down the hall, the only door that hadn’t been opened in the last five years. She shook her head and threw away her takeout container. ‘Some things are better left forgotten.’ She told herself what she wanted to believe.xxxxxShe sat in her bed with a novel in her hands, ‘The forgotten Woman’, she sighed as she read the time on her clock, 1:24 am. She closed her eyes and took a shivering breath.She placed her book on the nightstand and turned the lamp off.“I really hope it’s not one of those nights.” She whispered to no one except herself before drifting off. It was one of those nights.
