Chapter 1: Bucky
    




Chapter Text
Bucky keeps finding his clothes already worn. He opens his closet, and there they are, neatly folded, but already worn. Someone, somehow, keeps sneaking in and stealing his clothes, wears them, then returns them. Bucky can't figure out how, for once, and he's kept watch for sixty three hours before Steve's convinced him to get some sleep.Thing is, the clothes smell good, worn like that. Gone is the sharp smell of detergent, replaced with something homey and warm. They're clean, all of them, no stains or sweat or rips, but they smell like sunlight and wind and hugs.At first, he thinks it's Steve, but Steve smells differently. Bucky has checked. That's how he's found out exactly how ticklish Steve is on the side of his neck, but that's a story for another time. Bucky is left with secretly enjoying this, though he keeps on trying to catch the mysterious thief in the act. He ends up sniffing everyone, from Stark to the staff that cleans up the common rooms, to Natasha and even Bruce. Nobody smells like his returned clothes, and Bucky starts thinking that perhaps the thief's smell needs to be mixed with his own to obtain the delightful effect Bucky keeps basking in. And isn't that a thing to consider. It feels like he's needed to create this feeling of warmth, a little like the other person might be incomplete. It also means that he can't eliminate anyone from the long list of suspects.A couple of weeks later, another smell is hanging off his clothes, just as sunny as the other one, but it feels like a shared kiss under comforters, interspersed with mirth and chuckles.It's baffling.Bucky falls in love with it, this thing that keeps happening. There are two persons out there that are doing this, and he doesn't know why exactly, but he doesn't think it's out of malice. But it starts smarting, after a while, wearing worn clothes not enough anymore. He wants the real hugs and the real kisses and the real laughter. He's aware he won't get all that, because he doubts the thieves are driven by romantic intent, but perhaps he can weasel himself into a hug? Yeah, that would be nice. And he smiles wistfully at his closet, placing the note he's written on top of his t-shirt.'Please. Come out. I need you.'It's too much, and whoever's doing this will get creeped out most likely, but Bucky forces himself to close the door behind him.Two days later, he finds a note on his nightstand, a piece of black cloth next to it.'Trust us?'It's typed and printed, so Bucky can't tell who it is by recognizing handwriting.It takes him a week to work up the nerve to fit the blindfold over his eyes late at night, and he lies down, waiting.He's startled when a warm hand touches his shoulder, and he hasn't heard anything, despite the fact that he's been straining his hearing. The bed dips on both sides, and the hands multiply, with such gentleness that it leaves Bucky trembling. It's... nothing happens, well not in the way of getting naked and sweaty. But an entire world of sensation shakes Bucky to his core, hugs and cuddles, pecks and longer kisses, snuggling under the comforter. It's amazing, better than anything, fingertips running over his body, lips touching the skin of his neck, his forehead, his mouth.He falls asleep sated and content, and he expects to wake up alone.So when light falls onto his closed eyelids, and there are still two bodies around him, Bucky takes a deep breath. He's going to know, finally. Be able to love them back.His exhale is slow and shaky, as his eyelids flutter open, and he's ready.Bucky's ready to live.~
