“He’s just so mysterious.”Erik flagged a waiter down and resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Alex, listening a few feet away, obviously had no such reservations.“I must confess,” he said, gesturing with his glass. “I don’t entirely see the appeal. A grown man in a costume? It all seems a little…” he trailed off, lifting a significant eyebrow.(And now Alex was laughing at him. Well, that was easy enough to fix. The Batmobile needed a new coat of wax.)The socialites surrounding him laughed, throwing their heads back, but it was Charles who Erik was watching. Charles, who looked up through his lashes and said, “Oh, I don’t know. He’s very dashing, don’t you think?”Sometimes Erik hated being Batman. It was very difficult, wanting to punch yourself in the face all the time.

 At age eight, Erik’s parents were killed in an alleyway during a robbery.At eighteen, he fired the household staff, locked the doors of Lehnsherr Manor with a flick of his wrist and disappeared overseas.At twenty-three, he came back with a ruthless business sense and a sixteen-year-old ward. Questions about either one were answered with a knife-thin smirk.“No, but seriously,” Charles said a week after Erik’s return. They were where they always were (save for Erik’s missing years) at the tail-end of the Frosts’ annual gala: drunk in the gardens. Charles’ eyes shone in the darkness, and Erik could just hear the music, soft and faraway. “Where have you been all this time?”“Around,” Erik said, shrugging. He ran his thumb over the lip of his empty champagne flute. “I meant to call you. Or write.”“Liar,” Charles accused fondly. He tilted his head back. “I could make you tell me.”“Yes,” Erik agreed. “But you won’t.”“No,” Charles said. “But I’m hoping you’ll tell me on your own. What were you doing, all that time?”Erik slung an arm around Charles’ shoulders, pulling him in close, like they were teenagers again.“I’ll tell you the truth,” he said, bringing their heads close together. “Their names were Giselle and Isobel, and they were twin Brazilian supermodels.”Charles pushed him into the fountain.“It’s good to be back,” Erik called up at him, spitting up a decorative lily pad.

 On Thursday, Charles was kidnapped. Erik wished he could’ve been surprised.

 It was a little past sunset when Alex stormed into the cave, picked up the remote and switched the monitors on to the news.“I was trying to analyze the samples from last night’s museum robbery,” Erik groused.“You can do that later,” Alex said. “We already know the guard was in on it. Look.”Raven was on screen, surrounded by microphones. She was facing towards the right, saying, “No, I’m not doing that, I’m not – will you get out of my face? – no, screw you, that’s why –”Someone offscreen coughed meaningfully. Raven spun around to face the camera. She looked pinched and uncomfortable; her hair was a mess, like someone had tried to run a brush through it only for her to pull away.“My brother, Charles Xavier, was abducted this – you know what, no,” she said. She pointed a finger straight at the camera. “Whoever took my brother? Yeah, I’m talking to you, scumbag. You have no idea what’s coming for you. Batman is going to kick your ass like he has the last eight million times Charles was kidnapped. So you better be scared.”Most of the rest of Raven’s speech had to be censored out, and after a second the network cut away to a frazzled looking newscaster, awkwardly shuffling his papers and claiming “technical difficulties.”“You’re getting predictable,” Alex said.“Get your costume on,” Erik replied.

Charles was the first person Erik saw, after his parents were killed. There were police officers, and the kind old housekeeper who came and wrapped him up in a blanket and waited patiently to take him home, but they all glided by like ghosts, transparent and ethereal.Charles was the first person who seemed real.They weren’t friends, exactly. Their parents ran – had run, Erik had corrected himself, eyes prickling – in the same circles, and they were roughly the same age. It was expected that they play together.Still, one of the last things he’d expected was to look up and see Charles standing there, little face pale and grave.“Erik,” he’d said, voice thick. “I’m sorry.”Erik stared at him.“How did you know?” he asked, mouth numb. He was still shaking, feeling very small. “How did you get here?”Charles shrugged his thin shoulders. He sat down next to Erik in the hard plastic chairs. Looking around, no one else seemed to find Charles’ presence strange, so Erik didn’t either.“I heard you,” he said, tapping his temple. “All the way across town. That’s never happened before.”“You heard me?” Erik repeated, turning to face him. Charles looked earnest and scared and smaller even than Erik, sitting there like he was much older than he was, back straight and legs still. No fidgeting. Erik’s father told him not to fidget all the time; Erik swallowed hard, face hot.“I made the driver take me here, and
