Chapter 1: I Was Alone
    




Chapter Text

Sept. 6, 2006

Tony Stark sauntered down the red carpet, careful smirk plastered in place and flashing peace signs for the never-ending camera flashes. He signed a little girl’s book here, a little boy’s action figure there. He loved little kids, despite what the media might say. Not that he’d ever want one himself (he'd probably break them).
Questions flung from the sidelines, from the reporters and fans and fellow stars. Always with the questions. Tony deflected or joked, generally being a nuisance. The media thought they knew all his dirty little secrets.
They were wrong.
Tony Stark hid a grimace behind a jovial laugh as someone bumped into him, sending aches through his bruises. He tossed out a teasing comment about left feet, receiving a mocking response.

Always so cruel.

That was okay. He brushed the thought aside, refocusing on the premiere, or appearing to be focused there. He was a genius though, and he could easily think of multiple things at once, as long as he didn't mind being an asshole, and he didn't. That was the best way to hide.
He thought of his plans for tonight. There were three underground fights tonight, after the party; one was guaranteed to be bloody.
So that’s where he’d go.
