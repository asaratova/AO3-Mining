---Raven is six years older than Charles; Charles has never really considered this age difference vitally important in one way or another, except to decide that even if Raven were six years younger than Charles, she would probably boss him around in the exact same way. He doesn’t really think much of the difference between fifteen and twenty-one, until Raven comes home from college for a study weekend with her new best friend in tow, introduces him cheerfully as Erik Lehnsherr, and Charles finds himself falling head-over-heels into a train wreck of doomed lust.Erik is tall and lean, all sharp angles and strong hands and a waist that Charles can’t take his eyes off of; his voice is low and rumbling and male, hits Charles square in the stomach like a fist, and Charles holds his hand out and says, “Hello, I’m Charles,” hoping desperately that he doesn’t look as slack-jawed stunned as he feels, that he sounds adult and not like the little boy of fifteen that he is.Erik takes his hand, firm grip, dizzying warm touch, and his mouth quirks as he says, “Erik. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Charles.” He lets go after a stretch of time that is both far too short and agonizingly long, and disappears into the house with Raven; and then, and only then, does Charles remember to breathe.*What follows is a long two years of helpless attraction on Charles’s part whenever Raven and Erik come home. They’re out of college now but they’re working very nearby, and while Charles’s mother might not care much about who comes and goes at home, Charles is always eager to see his sister and her best friend, so they visit often and stay as long as they can.Charles asks Raven once, early on, if she and Erik are dating, and is immeasurably reassured when Raven bursts out laughing.“Oh, god no,” she says, still laughing as she speaks. “He’s my best friend. I mean, not that he’s not hot, because I’ve got eyes, but I like ‘em a little less ‘tall, dark and broody’, you know?”Charles doesn’t know, because all evidence points to ‘tall, dark and broody’ being exactly his type, but he smiles anyway, and curls into Raven’s welcome half-embrace.Instead of his attraction fading, Charles finds miserably that it only seems to intensify over those two years, because Erik is not just so effortlessly gorgeous that Charles has to jerk off twice before each time Erik visits so he won’t embarrass himself, he’s also intelligent and sarcastic and sweet when he thinks no one is paying attention, and he listens so intently when Charles talks that Charles feels a little faint, and he never, never treats Charles like a child.Sometimes, when Charles’s mother has been in bed for most of the day with a headache, Charles takes his homework over to Raven’s apartment and spends a blissful evening there and sometimes the night as well. Erik is usually there, too, sitting sprawled on the couch with a book propped on his thigh and half his attention on the television. Raven works on her laptop and pokes Charles every once in a while and yells at the TV whenever someone enters an unlocked house by themselves or otherwise does something that proves them too stupid to live; Erik laughs at her and slouches lower in his seat, legs falling further open. Charles buries his face in his textbook and steals glances at the line of Erik’s cock in his jeans, thinks about kneeling between his open legs and putting his mouth right there, feels his mouth flush wet with hunger.“This is how we know your sister never cleans this couch,” Erik says one time, voice low and amused, before he reaches out and rakes his fingers through Charles’s hair with no warning. Charles freezes, breath catching in his throat, and then he sees the shred of the fabric softener sheet that had apparently been caught in Charles’s hair, now twisted in Erik’s fingers. “Unless this is a fashion statement?” Erik asks, eyebrow arching, and Charles coughs to clear his throat.“No, it’s definitely Raven’s fault,” Charles says, inordinately proud of the way his voice doesn’t waver one bit, and Raven makes a rude noise and pushes Charles’s head down into the couch and tells Erik, “Oh, you’re one to talk, I’ve seen your place. You’re supposed to get rid of the dust, not make friends with it, you know.”Erik shoots something back in response, but Charles has stopped listening at this point. He turns casually over onto his stomach and picks his book up again, trying to hide the fact that he’s gone half-hard from just the feel of Erik’s fingers in his hair and the searing heat of his focused attention.For a seventeen-year-old perpetually caught in the throes of teenage hormones, Erik makes life difficult, to say the least.*Charles knows this is all hopeless, and most likely just an exceptionally persistent crush due to proximity that will fade away with time, and someday in the future Charles might even confess it to Erik and blush and accept his good-natured ribbing, but—Charles is almost certainly imagining it, but he
