Chapter Text
“I’m barely holding on, Hope!” Ant-Man yelled into his comm. The previous fight had gone on without a hitch, except for the fact that Scott was now on the top of a very high ceiling with no way down. Ant-ony was still retrieving the USB they were here for and Scott’s fingers were slipping fast. He could only hold on for so long.Almost instantly Hope replied, “Seriously Scott, I’m sure you can get down by yourself.”Scott shook his head no, even if Hope couldn’t see him, because that’s how much he couldn’t. No matter what, even if he was normal size, if he fell from this spot, he would most definitely perish. “Can’t you just fly up here?” Scott begged.“I’m sort of in the middle of something right now, Lang,” she forced out. There was a loud thud, a scream, and Hope was beating someone up for sure.“Aren’t I more important than that shmuck?” He whined.“This ‘shmuck’ is going to tell me everything I want to know, what do you have for me?”“Charm?” Scott offered.“Get off by yourself.”“I would if I could, but this suit is sort of tight.” There was a click and Scott was now positive that Hope had demolished her comm. Damn.Scott had to get creative, maybe he could call in a few extra ants to help. Using the ants nearby, Scott had them connect to form a bridge to the wall and climbed down their small brown bodies. Then he was going to have to scale using the tiny crevices in the paint job, this would be a lot easier if he could stick to things. After the mission he returned home to Cassie. “Hey pumpkin!” He picked up the young girl and swung her around, ignoring the soreness in his arms -he often regretted having never been mutated to have super strength or healing like some of the others. Despite his woes, he was glad he didn’t have anything creepy like ant antenna.“Daddy, did you see the news?” she excitedly burst out.“Since when are you watching the news?” he demanded; nonetheless, Scott shook his head and as his daughter dragged him to the T.V he muttered, “Knowing my life, I probably lived it.”Oh, how wrong he was, on the screen was a new hero -Spider-guy or something, a rambling kid- sticking right to the side of the Empire State Building, helicopters surrounded the tower, at the top was a ginormous rat. It almost looked like a parody of King Kong and Scott couldn’t believe his eyes. This was the best turn of luck he’d ever had; just today he’d been wishing he could stick to things and here was this hero proudly demonstrating his technology.They watched the film and saw how Spider-Man took out the rat -trapping it in a webbed hammock between two buildings- and all Scott could think was that he needed to talk to this dude. He pulled Cassie into his lap and asked, “How’d you like to meet him?”She instantly broke out into incomprehensible babble about how it would be a dream could true and Scott tried to ignore the sting of jealously for the superhero that had captured his daughter’s heart, “I’m still the best though right?”Cassie tilted her head as if deep in thought, “I mean, Spider-Man has webs and a really cool suit, so-“Scott rolled her over and began to tickle her until she, in gasps of air, admitted that her daddy was the best superhero.“Heck yeah I am. Now let’s go to Queens.” Peter’s day had going great, that is until a mind controlled gigantic rat climbed the Empire State Builiding and Spider-Man had to be called to action. After he ‘wrapped’ it up, he quickly disappeared to an alleyway, the rat had given him a large gash on his side and it stung. He could call Mr. Stark, but seeing as one hit had knocked Karen offline and Iron Man hadn’t shown up to baby him, Peter figured he could deal with it on his own.When he reached down to see how long it was, his hand came back bloody and Peter quickly gave up. He leaned against the damp wall and let his breathing come down to a steady pattern, he could already feel his skin stitch itself together. He would be alright, maybe he would go to Ned’s house to clean it up. While Peter was weighing his options, he didn’t notice the father-daughter duo that came up next to him. That is until the smaller half hurtled toward him to give his a hug, the impact of her stubby arms around his leg shook him out of his thoughts. The older man calmly sauntered over. Peter had no idea who these people were but could already smell trouble. The older man clearly wanted something from him.“Spider-Man right?”Peter nodded, wanting to jump to the point.“Well I’m Scott Lang and I was hoping you could help me.”Peter looked down at the little girl -who had released him from her death grip- and back up at the man, he looked like a younger, dumbed down version of Tony Stark without the goatee. Strangely, his spider sense wasn’t going off at all.“Help you with what? No offense, but I can practically feel your hidden motives,” Peter crossed his red clad arms across his chest ignoring t
