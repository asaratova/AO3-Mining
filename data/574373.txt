Chapter 1: Watertower
    




Chapter Text
  The majority of the destruction is behind him now; the Chitauri ships had hit mostly the skyscrapers and the big glass-and-concrete office towers.  In the part of Manhattan where Steve Rogers now finds himself, the locals have already started to do what New Yorkers do best – kick obstacles out of the way and get on with their lives.  There is still broken glass glinting on the sidewalks though, even here, catching and reflecting the neon lights.  It’s only been, what, three weeks? Seems a lot longer, especially since Steve hasn’t exactly had a lot to do since then; this latest war was over a heck of a lot faster than the first one he was involved in.  Plus, there’s only so many briefings a man -- even one super-enhanced with everything from strength to patience -- can endure, and he’s about seven decades past giving interviews. The buildings in this neighbourhood look lived in, slightly run down, comfortable.  Steve knows that it’s not close enough to Gramercy Park to attract the high rollers, and even though it’s on the wrong side of the Brooklyn Bridge, Steve feels more at home here than he has since … well, anytime since they pulled him from the ice, actually.  Walking down Lexington Avenue in the twenties is almost like shrugging into an old leather jacket that’s scuffed and soft with wear; his step picks up a little unconscious bounce as he walks. There’s a veritable symphony of smells coming out of the restaurants here:  Indian, Korean, Vietnamese food -- you name it, it’s there in the air.  And that Armenian-sounding spice shop at the corner of 28th?  Well...  It’s all different and unusual and amazing, and enough to make a man very, very hungry.  It’s funny, Steve ponders, how scents more than anything, bring back memories -- or force you to make distinctions.  His New York didn’t smell anything like this.  When he last walked these streets, the most exotic restaurants were places -- usually called Tony’s, he remembers with a grin -- where you could get spaghetti and meatballs.  Then there were those mom-and-pop operations on Delancey, where the women wore black woolen dresses and kerchiefs and you could get a dozen different kinds of pickles and maybe some borsht.  This … ethnic thing, as Stark calls it, is a part of his new world that Steve actually rather likes: all those different smells, food from all over the globe, and people who don’t seem to care so much anymore whether your last name sounds American enough. His nostrils flare a little as he sniffs a distinct overlay of Chinese in the air now – peanut oil, Steve has learned that smell is, and barbequed duck.  He must be getting close to his goal.  He still hasn’t entirely admitted to himself why he’s come here:  the best he’s done so far, is to tell himself that while he likes walking and learning this new-old city with his feet, he’s getting a bit tired of never having a destination.  And for once he actually (sort of) knows someone in one of the neighbourhoods he’s exploring.  So there it is:  A place to go.  As good a reason as any. It is well-known around S.H.I.E.L.D. that Barton prefers his own place to his quarters on the helicarrier (not exactly a social animal, the Hawk), so chances are about fifty-fifty he’ll be here.  Steve figures that this is as good time as any to get to know the man he fought beside (and against), and he settles on that as his second motivation for looking him up:  they’re supposed to be on the same team.  A team that, according to Nick Fury, ‘Captain America’ is supposed to be leading.  Right.  (Did anyone think to tell Thor, the god?  Or Tony Stark?) The door he wants is almost invisible beside the Chinese take-out place he’s been told to look out for.  The latter is brightly lit, with all the neon charm of a bus terminal, while the entrance to the rest of the building is black and a little foreboding.  It takes all of Steve’s enhanced visual acuity to make out the name plates beside their respective doorbells; five of them bear names he doesn’t recognize; the top one is blank.  Not exactly rolling out the red carpet for visitors and as high up as he can get?  Sounds like Hawkeye alright.  Steve decides to take the risk, and hits the button.  The door alarm is one of those obnoxious things you can hear all the way through the building, but even so, for a minute or two absolutely nothing happens.  Steve rings again, waits for a bit longer, and is just about to turn away (well, at least he did have a place to walk towards for a bit there) when the buzzer goes.  He shrugs away his surprise and pushes the door open. The stairs are wooden, well worn and so smooth they’re almost shiny; they creak a little as he puts his weight on them to go up.  And up.  And up.  The building is rather narrow, and there’s only one apartment per floor.  Hawkeye, as established by the buzzer hierarchy, lives at the very top. A couple of the lights in the staircase are burnt out and it get
