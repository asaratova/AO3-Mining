Chapter Text
Shouta really shouldn’t be surprised anymore.But somehow, he still is.He’s simply chatting with Yagi about next Monday’s lesson plan, the two of them standing at the edge of the common room.  The room is mostly full--the students gathered around the TV, passing GameCube controllers between themselves.  Iida had tried to construct some sort of elaborate turn system, but it quickly dissolved into whoever was able to pester one of the current controller holders for it the most.He hears Bakugou cuss out in frustration while Ashido lets out a whoop of victory. Stifling a sigh, he glances over at the group, prepared to intervene if Bakugou intends to let out his frustration out in any other way than verbally--when something else catches his attention.“...Aizawa?” he hears Yagi call as his body turns away from the man, eyes focusing just below the ceiling.  He makes out what looks like a small abrasion, standing out against the stark white of the nearby walls, shining bright and blue.Quickly, suddenly, it begins to grow.Immediately he snaps to attention, pure instinct washing over him.  He grabs at his capture weapon, posing himself at the ready.“Everyone, get back!  Move towards the nearest exit, but get away from the center of the room!” he barks out.  As soon as he gets the words out his students are on guard, dropping the controllers as they leap off the couch.  Again, he tells them to move away from the glowing circle, and while they do, they don’t exit the room, instead readying themselves for a fight.  He can even feel Yagi tensing behind him, and he’s sure he’s holding up his own fists, the idiot.His first thought is that this is Kurogiri, and dread all but consumes him at the mere thought that the League were able to bypass U.A. security yet again.  But no, this abrasion is distinctly blue, not purple.  A villain with a similar quirk?  It does look like a portal, but it--Suddenly, the portal turns black, and a figure drops from it.  He hears and oof! come from the person, who’s now splayed out on the floor in front of them.  The portal seems to shut, then dissolve into nothing.“Stay back!” he shouts, his students already moving towards the figure, quirks at the ready.  Small miracles, because they actually listen to him.  Shouta then leaps, capture weapon flinging out and tying itself around the figure’s hands.He pulls it, bringing what appears to be a man, to his knees, arms tied behind his back.  He’s dressed in some sort of red and blue spandex suit, with black stripes going down it.  They almost look like--webbing?His first thought, of course, is that this is a villain.  But the man made a rather graceless entrance, and is currently making no move to fight against his bindings.  Once he’s close enough, Shouta reaches out, and pulls the mask off of the man.  As soon as he does, a face turns around to greet him.It’s--a boy.  A kid.  No older than his students, he’s guessing.  And he’s eyeing over his shoulder towards Shouta, nervous energy flitting in his eyes.“Mr Stark?” he says blinking.  “No, uh, you’re not Mr Stark.”  He frowns, turning around as twenty pairs of eyes stare down at him, with varied expressions of shock, curiosity, and determination.He turns back to Shouta, and now he’s smiling sheepishly.  “Um.  Hi.  This probably looks really bad like, really bad because it looks like I’ve just broken into a….dorm?  Or uh, something, and it seems like you have superpowers because of your scarf...thingy, but I swear this isn’t what it looks like.”Shouta frowns.  His own posture is still guarded, tense, but...damn if this kid doesn't sound earnest.  If anything, he looks a bit panicked, his forced smile wavering quite a bit, but he hasn’t made any motion to fight against Shouta’s bindings.Although….there’s something off about this kid.  First of all, who says superpowers anymore?  And why did he sound so shocked by it, as if it was abnormal?  Nevermind that Shouta’s weapon isn’t actually a part of his quirk.  Secondly, he’s speaking Japanese, but his voice is strangely accented--American, if Shouta were to guess.  Not that it’s necessarily suspicious, but still noteworthy.The kid blinks again, back at Shouta.  “Um.  Where are we?”“We’re at U.A., you dipshit!” Bakugou shouts, palms of his hands literally smoking.  The kid’s eyes widen at the sight.“Woah, dude, are your hands okay?  Are they on fire?!”  The kid sounds genuinely bewildered, and it seems to throw off Bakugou--but only for a moment
