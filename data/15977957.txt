Work Text:
He's about to go on a school trip when he notices the danger. It's to Stark Tower. He's got a feeling that Mr. Stark went to the school and arranged the whole thing. The danger-sense runs up his spine when he stands outside the obnoxiously yellow school bus. Peter looks around, but everything is fine. Spidey-senses are annoying like that, they aren't a miracle worker and half the time it's only the puddle in front of me. I'm watching you, puddle, Peter thinks, eyeing the water reflecting the blustery blue sky. After an unfathomable amount of teasing on the weeks leading up to the trip by Flash, the bus ride isn't so bad. Everyone's too excited about going to care about some random kid that said he had a Stark internship. Once there, everyone's herded into the main lobby by the teachers. It's nice, clean and understated, all chrome and high-tech. The receptionists start to hand out passes - plain white cards with a zip code and GUEST printed across the bottom. When Liza, one of the secretaries, reaches Peter she smiles brightly. “Heya Peter. How are you?” Most of the staff at least know him by sight. It's hard not to, seeing he's around a lot. And, a teenager with more exposure to Tony Stark than most of the board of directors is a topic for gossip, to say the least. “I’m good, thanks Liza. How’s the new apartment?” “It was such a pain moving, but I’m really glad I did. I didn’t grab you a guest pass, I figured you could use your own?” “Yeah. I think I have it in my bag.” Liza moves down the line, while everybody gawks at Peter. It's apparent that he's not lying about his internship. Peter just smirks, pulling out a shiny matte card clipped to a lanyard, which he slips around his neck. Next everyone lines up to go through the scanners permitting us further entry into the tower. Flash gets locked out, the automated bot repeats: 'you do know whose tower this is, right? If you're trying to rob the place, you're out of luck.' in Tony Stark's voice. He made that certain security feature while drunk, and Pepper practically had an aneurysm when she heard. Peter chuckles, recalling the memory. Flash glares at him, thinking he's laughing at him. Then it's Peter's turn to pass his card over the scanner. Instead of the automated bots FRIDAY speaks: “Hello Peter, you’re early for any of your scheduled visits.” “Yeah, school trip.” He says awkwardly, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. His classmates mutter around me again. He catches more than one variation of: ‘Oh my god, so he wasn’t lying?’, ‘so his internship is real?’ and finally, what he's pretty sure is Ned’s gleeful voice: ‘I told you guys! He’s not lying!’ “Mr. Stark has been anxious for your arrival.” “Oh my god,” Peter moans, “what’s he gonna do?”  Asking is pointless, I=he already know the answer. “I am prohibited from telling you that.” Yep. Predicted. “Great.” he mutters, stepping through the metal detector. Everything goes fine, if rather boring. I've already had several tours of the place and knowing what’s upstairs and how cool it is doesn’t help. It’s only when a certain Natasha Romanoff strolls ‘oh-so-innocently’ into their class that Peter definitively knows Mr. Stark’s planning something. Amid all of the ‘oohhs’ and ‘aahhs’ she still finds time to push through the crowd and make it to Peter. “Hey Pete,” she smiles wickedly. “How much is Tony paying you?” he deadpans. “Oh I’m being paid in your embarrassment, детский паук,” she turns to face the rest of the class, now staring open-mouthed. "Hey, this is my main man, Peter Parker. I would like everyone to know, he once cried when Mufasa died on The Lion King!" "That was one time and it was very emotional," he defends, wanting to sink into the ground of embarrassment. Natasha knows this and she swoops down and kisses his cheek, leaving a sticky red imprint. Peter turns and hits his head against the wall as she sashays away, leaving only a ‘Seeya Peter!’ in her wake. By the time he's nearly recovered the class is halfway down the hallway, some still lurking to gape at him.    They're now in a hallway lined with some of the less experimental labs. Some even have widows showing inside. A door opens down the hallway. A certain blonde-haired super soldier exits, bare-chested and shaking hands with a man in a white coat, presumably a doctor. - Boy or girl - most of the class screams at the sight of Captain America shirtless. He looks up, eyes zeroing on Peter immediately. He raises his eyebrows and shrugs, walking towards us, thankfully slipping a shirt over his head while doing so. “You’re here too?” Peter asks despairingly. Steve grins, “Yep, Tony’s called in everyone.” “Demanded you have your check-up here, in a semi-public hallway along our classes route conveniently timed so we would see you?” "The doctor seemed very eager to get me out when he saw you lot coming down the hall. You know Tony.” “I’m starting to regret it.” Peter intones, “Don’t tell Mr. Stark I said that, FRIDAY!” “I’m so
