Chapter 1Disclaimer: I don't own anything. Everything belongs to their rightful owners.AN1: So when I was writing my last story, bind us together, I realised that I wanted to explore Tony having a positive relationship with his parents more and that I loved writing a friendship between Tony and Natasha so I wanted to explore that more and I always love writing story involving May and then Maria being involved just feel into place.Also I absolutely love the Howard Stark that was in the first Captain America movie and is in Agent Carter so I wanted to focus on him and how things would be if that version of Howard was the one who raised Tony.November 21 ST  1973To most of the people who know, or even know of them Peggy Carter and Howard Stark are just two close friends who run S.H.I.E.L.D together, though not a lot of people know the second part; but, that's not the truth. The truth is that Peggy and Howard have been together since 1949, after Howard grew up a bit, and in 1955 they married with only Edwin and Ana Jarvis as witnesses.In 1969, long after they gave up hope of becoming parents, Peggy became pregnant with a son, at the age of forty-eight, something which was only possible, according to Howard's best guess, because of substances that Peggy has been exposed to during her time being an agent. On May the 29th 1970 Peggy gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Anthony Steve Carter-Stark, though to most of the world he is Anthony Edward Stark, the son of Howard Stark and the woman that is believed to be his wife, Maria. In reality Maria is a friend who pretends to be Howard's wife when needed to protect Howard, Peggy and Tony as they have a lot of enemies and there are people who would have a lot to say if they knew that S.H.I.E.L.D'S directors were married.It is about nine o'clock at night and like she does most nights, once Tony is asleep, Peggy is outside hitting the punching bag.As she hits the bag Peggy suddenly hears, "PEG!" Being called by Howard.As soon as she hears that Peggy stops what she is doing and runs inside, where she finds Howard running down the stairs."What is it? Is Tony okay?" Peggy asks worried once she meets Howard at the foot of the stairs."He's fine, actually great, I was just reading him one of my old engineering booksâ€¦" Howard starts to say but Peggy cuts him off."Why were you reading our three-year-old son one of your engineering books?" Peggy asks, looking slightly disapproving."Because I thought it would make a good bedtime story." Howard explains, sounding like it's no big deal, "But that's not the point." Howard says and Peggy just gives him a look, but because it is one that he is familiar with it doesn't even faze him, "He finished the explanation of how the engine works without me even being half way through my explanation." Howard explains, looking amazed."Really?" Peggy asks, also looking amazed as she realises what that means."Really." Howard confirms, "I couldn't believe it, but he got it completely right!""That's so incredible." Peggy says, walking over to the couch as she needs to sit down to digest that, "He's three.""Yeah, it is." Howard confirms as he walks over to the couch, "I think he just proved what we've been suspecting. Our son's a genius, Peg.""Yeah, he is." Peggy realises, smiling at that as for a long time both she and Howard have seen that Tony is advanced for his age, but until now she didn't realise just how advance he is.As Peggy smiles Howard smiles back and reaches out and takes her hand, and the two of them drift into silence. As they do Howard rests his head on Peggy's shoulder.For a few minutes both Peggy and Howard sit in silence until they hear footsteps and Jarvis walks into the room."I was about to turn in for the night, do you need anything else, Ms Carter, Mr Stark?" Jarvis asks as even though Peggy and Howard are married Peggy is still Ms Carter to him, that's who she will always be to him."Nahh." Howard answers."No, thank you Mr Jarvis." Peggy answers."Jarvis, Tony's a genius." Howard says proudly."I am very glad to hear that, Sir." Jarvis says, looking glad about that, "I will see you both in the morning. Goodnight Ms Carter, Mr Stark.""Goodnight Jarvis.""Goodnight Mr Jarvis."After Jarvis leaves both Peggy and Howard drift into silence once more."There is something I want to talk to you about." Peggy tells Howard, breaking the silence after a couple of minutes."Something good or something bad? Because if it's something bad maybe I should get a drink first." Howard comments."It's not bad, it's about Natasha." Peggy explains as six months ago Peggy rescued, though not before she already had kills under her belt and undertaken missions, a thirteen-year-old girl called Natalia Alianovna Romanoff, that had started to go by Natasha, who had been given a serum to slow her ageing, from the same kind of training program as the one that Dottie Underwood went through.
