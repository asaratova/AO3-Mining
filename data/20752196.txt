Chapter 1: Nightmares
    




Chapter Text
Peter Stark had a secret. And not his Spider-Man secret.No, everyone important in his life knew about him being Spider-Man, especially after the recent very confusing time-wise events. His after school and occasional weekend activities wasn’t his big secret. No, his big secret was something that if his parents knew, he’d get in a lot more trouble for.Peter wasn’t sleeping.It wasn’t like he wasn’t tired. He had definitely nodded off in class a few times. Mr. Harrington either hadn’t noticed or trusted that Peter was smart enough to be fine without that section of notes. Mr. Dell, a new teacher who even though Peter found his presence strange he liked him well enough, had caught him dozing off in class. Unlike Mr. Harrington, he hadn’t been cool with it and made Peter stand up for the rest of the time (which Peter preferred over cold calling on him for whatever he had been lecturing the class about). Ned had had to poke him a few times in Robotics Club and Band, especially when he almost started drooling on his music one day. And MJ had resorted to chucking paper balls at him every time he dozed off in Decathlon.So, he definitely was tired. He just didn’t want to sleep.Every time he closed his eyes, his brain had a new horror for him. It was worse than after Homecoming. He had been dragged into space by aliens, faded out of existence in his dad’s arms, nearly died on a battlefield, and almost lost his dad. And his brain seemed only interested in reminding him of all of this. It hadn’t happened right away. He had been too busy feeling out of place and lonely in his own home. But after the vow renewal, things were fine for a few weeks. Peter had hoped that after the vow renewal after everything finally calmed down that things would be okay.He was wrong, of course. Things were far from okay.And then the nightmares started.He remembered the first night he woke, shaking and gasping for air, terrified of every shadow of darkness in his room. He very quickly realized his dad had not reset FRIDAY’s alert systems as he had sat in the darkness, trying to calm himself down and no one showed up to check on him. But knowing his dad, those alerts were going to go back into place soon. And Peter had an awful feeling that his nightmares and fears weren’t just going to go away.So, he had to get creative.An easy solution was Morgan. She loved bedtime stories and seemed to really want Peter to tell her stories. So, Peter would happily tell Morgan stories, until she literally couldn’t keep her eyes open. But his sister was four and went to sleep relatively early. Peter would then hang around the kitchen or the living room, helping Pepper with dishes or making his lunch for school or just generally talking to his dad. But eventually, he would be sent off to his room with the expectation that he would go to sleep. From there, Peter had a list of things he could do to stay away.The first one was leaving the light on. That one was a must; Peter couldn’t be afraid of the shadows if they weren’t there). The second was to do his homework. He even would sometimes get a head start on homework that wasn’t due for a while. The third option on the list was patrol. If he could be out on patrol, he’d stay out for as long as possible. Eventually Karen would tell him he had to go home or his dad would call him. And if all else failed, Peter would read. Peter discovered that reading could keep him up for a while. Sometimes it was a fiction book that had been lying around his room forever. Other times, he would re-read papers his dad or Bruce had written, making notes to himself on ideas or questions he had regarding their research (including Bruce’s new paper on bringing together his two halves which Peter found oddly fascinating).He wasn’t sure how he was managing to get away with his lack of sleep. In the past, he knew his dad always made sure he was asleep, whether it was checking on him or just standing by the door. But since he had used the stones, his dad slept a lot more. He knew it was important to his recovery, but Peter found it odd that his dad was sleeping so much. This was the guy that used to stay up all night in his lab, tinkering on projects. His mom didn’t seem to mind, but then again, she had been scolding his dad about his sleep schedule since before Peter was born. Perhaps, in a different time, his dad might’ve noticed sooner. But Peter was seemingly getting away with barely sleeping on weeknights.But he knew his luck was going to run out soon. “Tired kiddo?” The whole family was sitting on the couch watching a movie. It was Friday night and his dad had determined Friday’s were going to be family movie night. His dad had really done a lot in the last few weeks to make sure Peter didn’t start feeling like he didn’t belong again. Peter had been fighting back a yawn when his dad had spotted it. “Just a reflex,” Peter said. Morgan, who was squished next to him on the couch looked up at h
