Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It’s hot.A sticky sweet kind of heat, thick and syrupy on his skin as the night presses in around them.  Outside the cicadas sing, Spanish moss swaying in the trees, as the southern heat tries its best to smother everything and anyone.It’s different from the drier California heat he’s used to but, propped up on one arm on the feather soft mattress of the private cabin he’d bought, Tony resolutely doesn’t care.It’s hard to when there’s an acre of peach bitten Irish skin stretched out beside him, when all he can see are berry kissed lips stretched into a soft smile, and sweat beading in the hollow of a collar bone that Tony thinks he could spend the rest of his life sipping from.That he’s  vowed to spend the rest of his life sipping from.It’s hard to think of anything else except for the way that Steve’s eyes are so  blue  in the low lamp light.Blue and bright like summer days, warm like fire, as lovely as a song.Blue like the arc reactor that’s been Tony’s heart for years now,Tony reaches up and runs his fingers across the arch of his cheek, down his jaw, back up to press softly against his mouth in a wordless request.Steve lets him in.Because Steve  always lets him in.Just like Tony has carved a place inside of himself for Steve to crawl into in return.Tony only lingers for a moment though before he pulls spit slick fingers away and leans down to kiss him instead, soft as silk and spun sugar sweet.“I love you,” Tony whispers it like a vow because he has  never loved someone like he loves Steve and saying it too loudly right now seems almost sacrilegious.Tony has never been godly but he thinks exceptions can always be made.“I love you too,” Steve tells him back, hand sliding up Tony’s arm to twine their fingers, matching rings clinking together lightly.  “Forever.”Tony believes him too, is helpless to do anything else, because no has  ever loved him like Steve loves him.And  god, before Steve had come into his life Tony hadn’t even thought it was  possible  to love and be loved like this.It’s one of the few times that Tony’s ever been happy to be so very  wrong.So, Steve’s eyes are  blue.And Tony wants to die in them one day.It would be such a kind way to go, Tony thinks as Steve presses him down into the mattress, as he touches him, big hands soft and reverent.It’d be like being wrapped in love and warmth and  safety.Like being bathed in sunlight.Tony hopes that he’ll have earned a kind ending at the very least when his time finally comes.But for now …For now he has this, has  Steve, and  god Tony means to hold onto it, to him, with everything that he has.~~~The Compound’s quiet when Steve kisses him goodbye, lips soft and warm and easy.Eyes blue and bright and lovely as a song.“Give em hell, sweetheart,” Steve tells him with a grin.“For you?” Tony presses closer, slides a hand up to tug lightly at Steve’s hair, “baby I’m gonna reframe the future.”Steve laughs, fond and amused, and reels him in by his tie to kiss him again, deep and dirty and absolutely perfect.  Then he pulls back, smooths Tony’s tie down, and  smiles.And all Tony can think in that moment as he stares at Steve, hair messy and shoulders backlit by the rising sun, is that he wants to protect this until the day he dies. ‘This,' Tony thinks to himself, just a tad bit helpless, love stupid in all the best sort of ways,  ‘this is infinity, is eternity, is every future I’ve ever dreamed about.  I’ll do anything to keep it, him, safe.'From now until the day he dies.Tony promises it like a vow.Steady and true.~~~The problem is, Tony never expected that day to only be thirty-six or so hours away.~~~The snow is cold.The wind is biting.Steve’s eyes are still  blue.The shield comes down.The arc reactor sputters and sparks.The shield comes  up.“Finish it, Steve,” Tony rasps, blood welling in his mouth.  “Finish it.”It’s a plea.Or maybe it’s a prayer.Either way the truth is this:Tony’s mouth has, far too often, said the opposite of his heart.Steve knew that better than anyone.   Once.Or at least Tony had thought he did.Because Tony wants Steve to kill him almost as much as he wants him to  stop.And he’s not sure Steve knows that.Or, even worse, that he  cares.“Finish it,” Tony tells him, face bruised, chest broken, and heart just …  gone.It has been ripped out by the roots again, like it had been once before not so long ago, on a couch in Malibu, with a familiar buzzing in Tony’s ears and betrayal high and sick in his throat.And Tony doesn’t want to feel like this again, didn’t want any of the things that led to this.Hadn’t wanted them right from the start.All Tony had wanted was to keep their family safe.Just like all he really wants Steve to do right now is  stop.To hold him.To pick him up and carry him away through the Siberian ice and snow.To take the both of them back to that cabin and those sticky sweet nights where the air was thick as syrup and the moss hung like ladies’ lace from tree branches gone twisted with time.Ba
