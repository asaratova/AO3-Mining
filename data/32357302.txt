Chapter 1: August, Prologue... AKA The First Day of Senior Year
    




Chapter Text
May Parker checked the time on the microwave, sighed heavily as she opened the door to her nephew's room. "Peter, come on. It's seven thirty. School starts in an hour.""I'm up, I'm up." Peter groaned, slowly rising out of his bed and rubbing his eyes. "I'm awake...""Well, hurry up!" May said quickly. "Happy and I got a surprise for you!""Aunt May, it's not that big of a deal." Peter said exhaustedly as he closed his door and walked over to his closet, grabbing a black shirt with an atom on it and the words 'Just Break It' underneath and a red flannel, quickly changing into that and a pair of jeans. "It's just my first day of school for the year.""It's not just your first day of school!" May argued. "It's your first day of senior year for crying out loud!""I'm just trying to deal with it like it's a regular, every day thing." Peter argued, grabbing a pair of tennis shoes and tying them on after grabbing a pair of white socks. "I mean, it's also my first day of school where people know I'm Spiderman. This is already stressful enough as is. I'm just temporarily erasing the fact that it's also my first day of senior year."May sighed, flipping the pancake that was in the pan. Ever since the Disney World trip, Peter's life has essentially been go go go. Right away, when they came back, Tony formally started an engineering brigade for the biggest and brightest minds in the area, Peter was helping as much as he could with the Avengers's side project of helping Vision and Wanda build their house in New Jersey, not to mention that Peter was also babysitting Wanda and Vision's twins, Billy and Tommy, who had come to be during the Disney World trip, but also babysitting Tony and Pepper's daughter Morgan whenever they needed. Pile all that with the fact that he's also Spiderman and has those responsibilities and the kid has barely had enough time to actually sit down and accept that he going into his last year of high school. "Well, I still want you to sit down and relax for a second, kiddo. When you get dressed, come out here.""Not like I have much of a choice." Peter said snarkily. "My room is right next to the living room.""Calm down the sass, Peter." May said, laughing a little. "Humor me, please?""Okay, okay, I'm humoring you." Peter said, walking out of his bedroom and seeing Happy sitting in the couch. Happy had moved in a few weeks ago since things between him and May were getting more serious, so seeing Happy on the couch was kinda comforting. "Hi Happy.""Hi kiddo!" Happy said, quickly grabbing the box in front of him. "Excited for school?""Sure, that's what we're calling it today." Peter said, focusing on the box wrapped up with blue wrapping paper. "There's not a puppy in that box, is there?""Why don't you open it and find out?" May asked happily."Happy first day, Peter." Happy said, handing Peter the box.Peter hesitantly opened up the box, staring at what was inside. He pulled out the khaki fabric he saw, realizing that it was a jacket, the word Parker embroidered on the left corner of the front. Peter felt himself smiling and tearing up. "This is Uncle Ben's.""He would've wanted you to have it." May said, walking over and hugging Peter from behind. "He also would've wanted to be here today to walk you to school on your first day of senior year.""I'm not a kid anymore, Aunt May. I literally save the world on a daily basis, it feels like. I think I can walk myself to school.""I know, but I thought that you could wear it to school today. I know that it's kinda warm right now and that it gets cold in school, but I thought that it'd be like Ben was with you." May said, letting go of Peter and walking back to the kitchen. "It was actually Happy's idea. He found it in the back of my closet and got it cleaned up."Peter smiled, putting on the jacket. He remembered the times when he was younger that he would steal it from Uncle Ben. The jacket was still giant on him, but at least Peter can poke his hands out of the jacket now. "Thanks Happy.""No problem kid." Happy said, smiling a little. "Go eat some of the breakfast May made."Peter nodded, walking over to the table. A few minutes later, Peter was out the door, backpack flung over his shoulder and walking down the road to get to the subway. As Peter was walking, he noticed Tony come flying over in his Iron Man suit, the face shield lifting up to reveal Tony's face. Peter sighed, rolling his eyes. "Mr. Stark, what are you doing?""What does it look like I'm doing? I'm walking you to school.""No, you aren't. You are currently drawing attention." Peter said, noticing some people staring at him and Tony.Tony sighed, the suit opening up the rest of the way as he started walking beside Peter. "Now I'm not.""Oh good God..." Peter said exhaustedly. "You know I can walk to school by myself, right?""I know, but I'm not gonna have this moment with Morgan until she's seventeen years old. She's s
