Chapter Text
Meeting Jane had been like discovering her favorite food (which for the record was gummy bears).  Darcy wasn't blind to her faults as a person.  She knew Jane wasn't perfect, just like she knew that gummy bears were, in the words of Seasame Street, a 'sometimes food'.Jane wasn't a perfect person, but she was the perfect person for Darcy.She was also the perfect person for someone else, as evidenced by the words that circled her right arm.  A bitter woman would say that they looked like a shackle.  Darcy was not bitter, and did not think that at all.Sometimes when Jane had to roll up her sleeves to wash the dishes (or more often, when she was sanitizing the pipettes in the lab), Darcy saw her looking at them.  They demanded attention in a way that Darcy’s didn’t.
YOU!  WHAT WORLD IS THIS?
And above that, so much smaller, tucked into the curve of her elbow;
Hold on, I think I can fix this.
There were thousands of studies about what a person’s soul marks did to their psychological development.  Darcy generally thought that they were bullshit, but she could see how staring at the words “What world is this” might have made Jane who she was.Darcy was more of a ‘best supporting actress’ type of soulmate.She could accept that.   It had been obvious from the beginning that this was going to be a platonic connection, because Jane was so straight it was painful.  
Darcy had actually felt relieved.  Not that Jane wasn’t beautiful-- of course she was.  Darcy just had a better track record as a friend.
