As Darcy sorted through Jane’s email she might have sighed just a little over the reminder for the Stark Industries’ Holiday Ball.  It was THE most elegant party of the season, where people still dressed up in tuxedos and ball gowns. Couture wasn’t out of place. People Magazine covered the event every year. Darcy, like millions of other twentysomethings, turned the pages afterward, wishing and dreaming just a little. There would be champagne, caviar, and dancing like nobody’s business. Jane had an invitation tacked to her cork board above her desk.  A real one, handwritten in midnight blue ink on thick gold paper stock with soft edges.Of course, Jane would go. Thor. Avengers. That kind of thing.Darcy found the invitation crammed under Jane’s monitor, still sealed. She wrinkled her nose at the crinkled corner, opened it like a good unpaid intern, and fished out the reply card behind the invite. She filled it out and personally walked it to Pepper’s office to hand it over to one of the assistants. Then she threw away the envelope and tacked the invitation up on the board to remind Jane of the upcoming party of the year.As Jane was dating an Avenger, Darcy had come to know some of them.  Natasha, because she and Pepper were friends. Tony, because he kept poking his nose in Jane’s lab, and Darcy had become pretty good at shooing him away.  Clint, because he was everywhere, all the time.  The others, not so much. She’d seen Bruce and waved at him, happy when she got a shy smile in response. Steve was more elusive. She’d heard from Jane that his friend, Bucky, had a rough go of it at Hydra’s hands. Steve spent most of his time in Brooklyn helping Bucky come to grips with it. It was noble and something like Captain America would do.  She caught a glimpse of him here and there, enough that they would smile in at each other in passing, but they’d never met formally. She spent the week poring over Pinterest pages and clicking on various dress shops to find something fashionable and affordable, though Jane could spring for something nice, considering she lived with Thor and ate cereal four times a day. She found the perfect place, a dress shop operated by recently graduated fashion designers hoping to make their name in the industry.  Dressing an attendee to the Holiday Ball would be quite a coupe for one of them. Darcy dragged Jane out of the lab and into the shop that Friday morning. With only a week before the ball, there wasn’t much time for alterations and shoe shopping. The designers fell in love with Jane. With her long hair, slight curves, and petite figure, she was a perfect form for the lean lines designers adored. Jane giggled her way through the dresses and landed on something that would complement Thor’s elegance.  It was long, red, strappy, and nothing like anything she’d ever worn.  Tiny crystals made long trails in the front of the gown. The designer nearly hyperventilated when Jane selected his gown, and it took a good five minutes of Darcy plying him with water before he could pin it up properly for alterations. He carefully marked on the fabric where Jane’s soulmark curved along her shoulder. He would cut away the heavy fabric, replace it with something shimmering and translucent, and edge it in crystals in the current fashion trend. The ecstatic designer provided the scrap of fabric and a photo for shoe shopping, and off they went for that part.  As it turned out, there was a school for shoes not too far away, and they stopped there first. Jane wasn’t too keen on heels, but when she discovered what it was like to wear elegant shoes (Darcy had a single perfect pair) with cushiony support, the perfect height and not a rub mark to be found, she changed her mind. The color of moonstones, they wouldn’t detract from the fabulous dress, and yet, they, too, were beautiful enough to stand on their own. Darcy refused to be jealous, but it was so hard not to touch the gowns and shoes and wonder what it would be like to walk into that ballroom as if she belonged.  To have her soulmarks on display (One around her ankle, “Did you lose something, doll?” The other started between her middle knuckles on her left hand, wound through the same fingers, skimmed along the top of her palm and ended on along her little finger. “Don’t mind my staring, ma’am. You’re beautiful, I’m a jerk, and may I help you to your feet?”) Both of her soulmarks had beautiful handwriting, something less and less common these days. (She’d even heard of someone with a soulmark in Comic Sans. Ewww.)She hadn’t met her soulmates yet, but that didn’t bother her.  Her parents hadn’t met until they were fifteen years older than she was now.  But the marks were darkening, a sure sign that the time of their meeting was approaching, though it could be tomorrow or sometime five years from now.  It wasn’t an exact science. Of course, she wondered, but dwelling on it wouldn’t get her anywhere, so she set it to the back of her mind and focused on
