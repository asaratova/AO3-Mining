Maria wakes up, body sore and head pounding.Her mind's a blur, she’s confused, can’t remember what’s happened.The last thing she can remember is that she was in the town-car.  She was on the way to the gala, Jarvis was driving and ...“H-How-ard.”  Maria moans his name out as she tries to shift her body around because he'd been with her too.  He'd been in the back of the car with her.  She's sure of it.Head fuzzy and eyesight fading in and out no matter how hard she tries to focus, Maria finally manages to turn towards her right after a too long struggle.A scream catches in her throat, gets trapped behind her teeth and swallowed abruptly.In the seat beside her is Howard.Face bloody and mangled, skin peppered with glass and tailored tuxedo rumpled, he’s so obviously dead that for a long second Maria can barely breathe.Her next instinct is to get away, to get far away from the horror that’s settled so close to her.She goes to reach for the car door but the shock of pain that comes with moving her arm stops her cold.A cold sweat dampening her brow, Maria manages to shift enough that she can just see out of the car’s windshield.The pain's too much though and her vision wavers.Black closes in around the edges and the last thing she sees is Jarvis.He’s sprawled across the ground in front of the car, body twisted like a broken doll, and Maria knows he’s gone too.The pain take her a few seconds later and the world around her goes black.But, right before she passes out, Maria swears she hears the sound of a motorcycle getting fainter in the distance.But she’ll never exactly be sure.~~~Maria doesn’t come to again until she’s already in the hospital.She’s covered in cuts and bruises with a snapped collar bone and her newly widowed status weighing her down.On the brighter side her hospital room is plush and luxurious, the finest available she’s sure.  She is, after all, a Stark.But it’s also empty.Honestly Maria wasn’t excepting anything else.Instead of dwelling on the issue she closes her eyes and lets the pain medication drag her back under again.~~~When she’s finally released it’s into the care of a rather handsome private nurse and the youngest house maid Henrietta.  The girl wrings her hands and frets as they guide Maria into the back of a town-car and take her home.For the first time in weeks Maria finally gives a passing thought to Natasha.She doesn’t dwell though.The girl had stayed behind that night, she wasn’t in the car with them and someone would have told Maria if she was dead as well somehow.She’ll be fine.But then, of course, she always seems to be fine in one way or another no matter how hard Howard tries to put her down.‘Besides,’ Maria can’t help but think with a bitter little curl of her expertly painted mouth, ‘Howard’s dead now after all so by all accounts she should be thrilled.’Maria aches a bit at the thought of her dead husband, at the thought of the brilliant man he’d been when they were both younger.Before bitterness and drink had stolen them both away from themselves.The ache only lasts for a moment though before painkillers and apathy steal it away.  Maria doesn’t linger over the thought, wouldn’t even if she could.  The Howard she’d once loved has been dead for years now, just like the Maria she’d once been has.Maria won’t cry over spilled scotch and shattered crystal.Over a young, brilliant woman’s naive dreams of a dashing genius and a life lived in luxury and love.Tears would be … unseemly.~~~Maria only sees Natasha again for the first time days later.It’s been months since she’s seen the girl and now that she finally has she finds a certain sort of irony at the fact that it’s Howard’s funeral that brings them together again.A funeral that, Maria knows all too well, could have so easily included her own.Natasha stands beside her, a perfectly composed statue clad in a black designer dress paired with large shades that cover a good portion of her face.‘She really is a lovely little thing,’ Maria can’t help but think as she flicks her attention between Natasha and watching the casket be lowered into the ground.Natasha’s all fine workmanship, a tiny and delicately crafted creature.  She’s from quality stock of course so it’s to be expected to a degree.  Still she’s undeniably a cut above many of the other daughters the society wives like to try and thrust in Maria’s face on a regular basis.It’s easy to see the promise of true beauty already blooming across Natasha’s face and figure.  Even with that horribly wild hair of hers she’ll be a thing to be envied before long.For many she already is.Maria gives herself a mental shake and turns her attention back to what really matters.It wouldn’t do to look too distant or too calm today of all days.Properly expressed mourning is an art form after all and Maria has long since learned to give the press what they want.~~~Maria doesn’t go to Jarvis’ funeral the next day even though she’d known Edwin for years.  He’d been loyal to Howard long be
