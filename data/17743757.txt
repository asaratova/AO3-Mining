Chapter 1: h e l l o
    




Chapter Text
Okay so maybe he had been talking about some explosions in Tony’s lab too loudly at lunch. But to be fair, it was hilarious. When MJ complained about it and suggested to just make a Twitter account and start using that as his outlet for all his stories she probably meant it as a joke. 
Peter took it completely seriously.
