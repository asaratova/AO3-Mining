Work Text:
The first time they have sex, it's literally an accident. They'd been working side by side for weeks, compiling a body of work and research that would have taken other teams years or decades. Bruce's training and experience combined with Tony's skills and resources have proven a fine partnership. With their shared considerable intelligence or propensity to genius as Tony might say factored in, they'd made more headway on Bruce's big problem and some of Tony's smaller ones than either had been able to achieve on their own. And they'd both liked doing science together and gotten on well and gotten to be even better friends, and the whole thing was going rather splendidly and ordinarily (for them) when they accidentally have sex.Maybe they had gotten too cocky really, not wearing the safety equipment that would have been required for grad students that day in the lab. The last few days they'd made headway in several experiments involving tranquilizing and emotion-altering serums, and the first round of tests on the rats had been promising. Anything that might slow down the Hulk once he was turned was welcome to Bruce, and it had been Tony's idea that the monster's mood could also be altered with the right chemical equation.“Imagine, if you will, happy Hulk,” he'd said, spinning a glass beaker counterclockwise on the tabletop. “Or super-focused Hulk, ADD-cured Hulk. Cuddly, humanity-loving, rescuing-kittens-from-trees Hulk.” And Bruce had snorted but let Tony order up a bevy of fancy and exotic elements to experiment with. “We'll cook the big guy an antidepressant that'll make Big Pharma and Hollywood weep simultaneously,” Tony promised.And they'd been cocky about the early signs of success, so that Bruce is being an idiot and isn't wearing anything more than safety goggles bent over the centrifuges in the lab with Tony across the room bent over the rats. That's when one of the construction teams in the basement accidentally hits the mainline, and Stark Tower, for all its safeties, flickers out and dark faster than it takes to blink. In the next blink the lights came back on, and the power surges, and the tube Bruce has been halfway inserting is snapped up by motion and smashed. Liquid and vapor are spun at him, flung at him, and then he is stumbling back, tearing at his coat, heart beating much too hard. Never a good sign. Knows the way this kind of thing usually goes.Tony's hands on his shoulders, at the back of his neck. Tony's voice, steady, saying, “It's okay. It's okay, Bruce. Tell me. Which tube? Which one?” There are many options, many emotional states they've diluted down to their essence, and some are better to have been sprayed with, and some, for Bruce and Tony and the Hulk and Stark Tower, are far, far worse.“The -- the --” Everything in Bruce is shifting, altering, his blood rushing, his instincts no longer his own. “Oh God, I --”“Are you changing?” Tony's strong hands help rip away his coat, his compromised shirt. His fingertips skim Bruce's collarbone as though trying to detect a sudden surge in green underneath the flesh. Bruce groans. Tony's voice is not frantic, never frantic, Bruce appreciates that about him. Tony's voice is crisply cool. “Banner. Are. You. Changing?” When Bruce's response is to gasp and flutter his eyelids and start to shake as the first crest of it rides him he hears Tony tell the air, “JARVIS, I want my suit brought up to Dr. Banner's floor and four teams positioned both above and below the main elevator. Stand by. ”“Yes, sir. Do you require--”“No,” Bruce is able to rasp out then. “No, Tony. I'm not -- I won't -- I --”But he's still tearing at his clothes so he's probably not imparting the highest level of confidence. His hands are on his buckle and nearly part the zipper from his fly and then he's shoving all of it away, all the clothes are blessedly gone. He's standing bare-assed naked in the lab, and maybe now Tony will understand what no words could quite convey. Bruce is so turned on he could nail nails with his dick, which had swelled to its full impressive size immediately after contact with the solution. He's bigger than usual, even, totally engorged with rushing blood and all-encompassing need. He snaps his mouth shut and lets his trembling hand attempt to offer some relief. Has several milliseconds ago decisively stopped caring about the presence of Tony Stark and his ethereal robot butler.Tony is watching, head tilted, scientist's curiosity combining with his best in rakish grins. He no longer looks uncertain, just observes. “Ah-ha,” he says. “So it was the pheromones.”Bruce bites out a groan. Since the fucked-up cat's out of the fucking bag -- “Feels like I'm gonna die if I don't come,” he manages, somehow meeting Tony's gaze. He knows that most of him has flushed crimson. Better than green at least. He's so hard in his own hand it's alien: it's been longer than Bruce can remember since he was so aroused. Isn't sure if he's ever been. Get a facefull
