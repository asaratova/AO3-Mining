Chapter 1





Chapter Text
As the half Strigoi, half Draugr Clarke Griffin had learned from years of experience, her mates had very specific preferences, as she did.And honestly, she loved every bit of it.1.	Helena BertinelliA: Aftercare: Helena, for all her gruffness, and for her years and years of killing and feeding, was very caring with her partners.  At least, Helena had always been caring with Clarke, as Clarke Griffin had found.B: Favorite Body part: Of herself and of her partner’s: Helena’s favorite part of herself, was her hands.  Even before she had been turned by the coven that had taken her in, after her family had been slaughtered, she had always used her hands for a lot.  To play the piano, to sew, to write and draw and paint.  And when her family had been murdered and she had been taken in and raised by a vicious coven of vampires, her hands had been used for far deadlier things.  And those same hands avenged her family.  And as she had learned with many partners before she had found Clarke, her soulmate, her hands were efficient for other things.Helena’s favorite part of Clarke, was her smile.  Before and after Clarke discovered who her stalkers and protectors were, Helena always loved Clarke’s smile.  Clarke’s life had been filled with sadness and insecurities, even after the Barton family had adopted her.  The Barton family had given her so much love, yes.  But Clarke had always been insecure.  And seeing Clarke’s smile always made Helena happy.C: Cum: Helena’s favorite place to cum was against Clarke’s cunt, grinding up against her until they came against each other.  D: Dirty secret: Helena had been around for a long time.  Not as long as Hela, Thundra, Diana, Natasha, Yelena or Melina, sure.  But she had been around a while.  And she had done a lot with other partners before Clarke.  But something that Helena was hesitant to propose something that she really wanted to do with Clarke, was using a strap-on on Clarke not for hours, but for days.  And now that Clarke was a vampire?  That was doable.  Vampire stamina and all that.E: Experience: Helena was old.  Again, not the oldest in the coven, but old.  She was five hundred years old.  And she had been raised by vampires to be an assassin.  She had been with several people before she had entered a relationship with Clarke.  Always casual relationships.  Just fucking women but no actual relationships.  Because of the eras that these casual relationships took place, it would have been dangerous for any human that Helena had been with to be open about the relationship, as same-relationships weren’t even tolerated, let alone same-sex marriage being legal back then.  But even when Helena had sex with vampire women through the centuries, vampire women who were far from reserved, because vampire culture was different from human culture, Helena had always kept those relationships simple.  Until Clarke, that was.2.	Dinah LanceA: Aftercare: Dinah always wanted to be there for Clarke.  During sex.  After sex.  Dinah knew how to tend to her partners’ needs and wanted Clarke to know that she would do anything that made Clarke feel safe, comfortable and secure.B: Favorite Body part: Of herself and of her partner’s: Dinah’s favorite part of herself, was her voice.  She always had loved singing, as had her mother, before her mother’s murder.  Dinah supposed that it was fate that she loved singing so much and she had been turned by a vampire known as a “siren.”  She hated him.  Roman Sionis.  She wasn’t sad that he and his mate, Viktor Zsaz were dead.  But she supposed that it was fate that it had been a siren that had turned her.  And if it meant that it led to her eventually finding Clarke, she figured she couldn’t be too angry about it.Dinah’s favorite part of Clarke, was Clarke’s legs.  She always felt exhilaration, whenever Clarke wrapped her legs tightly around her arm or head, whenever Dinah had her hand or head between Clarke’s legs.  Or whenever Clarke wrapped her legs around Dinah’s waist whenever Dinah used a strap on Clarke.C: Cum: Dinah’s favorite place to cum was in Clarke’s mouth.  Feeling Clarke’s mouth on her, licking her, sucking at her clit and thrashing her tongue around inside Dinah, sent Dinah right over the edge.D: Dirty secret: There were a lot of things that Dinah allowed to happen when she had been under the control of her sire, Roman Sionis.  Amongst them, having to stand back and do nothing while some children died.  She knew that having been Roman Sionis’s fledgling, she had had almost no say in anything.  However, that didn’t keep her from feeling guilty. E: Experience: Dinah had a lot more experience than she claimed.  Under the control of Sionis, she had not been able to have many close friends or lovers, but she had been with people.  Before joining a new coven after Sionis and Zsaz’s deaths, one of the most notable relationships had been with a vampire named Oliver Queen.  But that had been ages ago.  And Dinah was with h
