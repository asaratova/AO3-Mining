Chapter Text
     Peter wasn’t really having a great day. Or week. Come to think of it, its been a pretty shi-crappy, sorry Cap, past few weeks.       It all started when Peter and the team, Bucky and Loki included as they were now cleared of all charges and living in the tower, were lounging about in the Avengers living room. He was sprawled across one of the many worn-in leather couches with his head in Loki’s lap and legs in Bucky’s. Tony, his adoptive father, was sat in a loveseat conversing with Bruce who was on the armchair. Natasha was sat criss cross on the floor below Peter. Clint was on the footrest. Thor was on the couch to their left next to Steve, both of whom were comparing Earth’s politics to Asgard’s. Sam was in the connecting kitchen talking to Scott while making hot chocolate. Rhodey was on another couch with Vision, who was cuddling Wanda, all of whom were watching whatever TV program was on. (It was Dance Moms.)      It was a lazy day in SI - Tony ended up not selling the tower after the whole Homecoming fiasco and the team now lived there, but still regularly went to the compound (but don’t tell anyone it was mainly for Peter) - There were no missions, no school, and most importantly, no alien invaders.      Peter had his eyes closed, nodding off as Loki threaded his hand through his hair and Bucky had his cool metal arm across his legs. Just as he were about to fall asleep, a loud alarm rang throughout the room interrupting the soft chatter, and thoroughly startling the spiderling into a sitting position at which Loki gave a noise of protest.       Annoyed at the interruption, all present company looked towards the dining table to see a hologram that had popped up saying ‘INCOMING CALL: EYE PATCH”. Grumbling, Tony gave an exasperated sigh and said, “JARV? Accept please. May as well get it over with.” The hologram then gave-way to a rather, ahem, upset looking Nick Fury.      Glaring, the bald one eyed directer started to talk. “Avengers. We have a HYDRA threat that needs to be neutralized. All the information needed is being sent as we speak. Fury, out.” And with that, Nick Fury ended the call.      Giving an over-dramatized sigh, Clint threw his head back and stood from the footrest. “And here I was, hoping to get absolutely nothing done today.” ——————————————————————————————————————————      So here they were now, at one of the last remaining HYDRA bases. This one was on an offshore island. It was relatively small and not well guarded. Since it was so small, only a handful of Avengers had to come. Spiderman was to get in, disable the security system, and recover all files. Ironman was more or less back up, but he provided air support. Black Widow was to enter along with Hawkeye after the security system was disabled and takedown any agents. Captain America and Ant Man stood guarding the main exit, also taking down any agents that somehow got outside. Bruce was in the Quinjet on standby for medical purposes.      It was supposed to be simple, Quick. In and out.      But then everything went wrong and shit hit the fan.      “Webs! Head in through the top window and disable the security.” Tony said through the coms. “Careful, theres electricity two feet below the ceiling. Don’t want a fried bug.”      Giving a fake offended gasp, Peter started to crawl up the side of the brick building. “I am offended! Spiders are arachnids, not bugs!”      “Just get in and do the job!” Steve stated, not unkindly, as he just wanted to get everything finished and done. Grumbling, Peter followed the commands and went inside. He immediately felt the buzzing electricity underneath him that was making his senses go crazy.      Alarmed, Peter whispered into the coms, “Hey guys, this electricity is making my senses go crazy. Im not gonna be able to detect any incoming danger”. At this, Clint gave a small curse and replied,       “Don’t worry bug. Tasha and I will be watching you.” Too on edge to correct the archer, Peter started to crawl across the ceiling as flat as he could go. All was silent over the coms as he made his way throughout the base and to the security room. Looking up (or was it down?), Peter saw three HYDRA agents below him, manning the computers. Luckily for him, there was no electricity in this room but his senses were still going crazy over it, so he was able to silently drop down behind the agents. Acting fast, he shot his arms to the sides and webbed the two agents on the sided and slammed their heads into the one in the middle. They all went down.      Shaking his arms out and jumping Peter gave a relieved sigh. “Phew! I thought I would never get out of there!”       “Good job kid. Now get those security systems down.” Tony commanded, as they had to hurry to attract minimum attention.      “Right! Right.” He darted forward and his finger started flying across the keypads. Only a couple minutes lat
