Chapter 1: Introductions
    




Chapter Text
Bucky Barnes climbed out of his car and took a moment to observe his surroundings.  The elementary school’s parking lot was rapidly filling up.  Even though the building was a new one to him, he took comfort in the familiar sights of a playground and a lot full of mini-vans and older sedans.  Well, all the cars looked like that save the red, flashy sports car whose license plate read “STRK2”. Bucky pulled his messenger bag over his shoulder before grabbing the last box of things he needed to finish setting up his new second grade classroom from the backseat.  He hip-checked the door shut on his green Corolla and took a deep breath before heading into the building.It was the first in-service day of the school year at his new school.  He’d spent the last four years teaching fourth graders at another elementary school in the district, but the social groups among the staff had clinched into cliques that didn’t interact with each other, and the principal was clearly coasting his way to the maximum pension payments before retiring.  By the end of last year, Bucky had been so frustrated that the only option he felt he had was to transfer to another school.  Thankfully, his old college friend had let him know there was an opening for a second grade teacher at the school where she served as the P.E. teacher, and Bucky was able to earn his transfer.  Not that Bucky believed tenure is the greatest of ideas (he’d seen too many teachers become spontaneously lazy once they hit that mark), but job security was a nice thing to have in this economy and transferring out to a different district meant he’d have to start all over again.  Even though it was a new building and staff, as soon as Bucky hit those doors, he’d be tenured for the start of his fifth year, and that was a nice, secure feeling to have. Granted, switching schools had its downsides, too.  It meant shifting from team lead over his intermediate grade down to second grade, and losing his extra title and barely-there bump in pay, but he didn’t particularly care.  It would be nice to have a break from extra meetings while adjusting.  And he enjoyed the challenge of a new grade, a new building, and a new curriculum; he never wanted to be that teacher who settled on lesson plans and never updated them. But all of it was still new.  He’d logged a number of hours in his room in the last couple of weeks, but hadn’t met too many new faces.  He knew Natasha, of course, and owed her big time for helping him transfer over.  He’d also met Jessica Drew, the team lead for second grade, but she’d been on her way out to make a Target run for supplies.  She’d offered to have him tag along, but he had boxes to unpack.  And he’d already gone himself—twice. As he approached the office vestibule door, he started to shift the box in his arms so he could have a free hand when a voice behind him shouted, “I’ll get that!”  Bucky turned to see a man with dark curly hair, glasses, and a shy smile rushing up to the door.  “Here,” he said, “you’ve got your hands full.”“Thank you, uh—““Bruce.  Bruce Banner.  I’m one of the kindergarten teachers.”“Bruce,” he acknowledged with a nod.  “I’m Bucky.  New to second grade.”The other man’s eyes scrunched in slight confusion.  “Bucky?  I heard about a James.”Bucky rolled his eyes as he walked into the office.  “I take it you’re friends with Natasha.  Call me Bucky; she’s the only one who calls me James.”“Because Bucky is a stupid name,” came a familiar voice.He turned with a smile at the petite redhead.  “Morning, Nat.”“About time you showed up, I’ve been waiting on you,” she answered from the spot on the front counter she was perched on. A moment of panic settled into his chest as he tried to nonchalantly yet franticly search the walls for a clock.  Bruce chuckled behind him.  “Don’t worry.  You’re on time for your first day here.  The Soviet just thinks that being anything less than a half hour early means you’re running late.”Natasha shot Bruce a dirty look as he moved around the pair of them to a place deeper into the office before retorting, “Punctuality is appreciated by most people, Banner.  And besides, James here was perpetually late in college.  I’m surprised you made it this early, actually.”“Haha, very funny.”“Seriously, how many extra miles did you have to run for being late for ROTC in school?”“And just when I thought about getting you a nice gift for getting me hired here.”“I accept cash and killer heels.”Bucky smiled, “I’ll keep that in mind.”  He looked around the office.  Their principal—Fury—was conversing with a tall redhead by the copier, and the busty brunette—Darcy, if he remembered correctly—who ran things in the front office was busy putting on finishing touches to her nails with a lime green polish pen.  He felt his mouth quirk in confusion, and he leaned in towards Natasha.  “What’s the plan?”“I’ll help you put your stuff in your room, then we can hit up the breakfast spread in
