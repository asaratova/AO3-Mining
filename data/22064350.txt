Chapter Text
Pepper had been telling Sharee about the recent events involving Obadiah.It was her mention of Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. that did it. At first, Pepper hadn’t realised anything was happening in her friend’s head because she’d mentioned them in the middle of a sentence. Then, when she stopped, Sharee Pertinicle spoke in a tone of voice that Pepper had never heard from her before.‘Pepper,’ she said. ‘Get Tony, get Rhodey, get Happy, and get yourself into a secure room. When you’ve done that, give me a call. I’m going to come and tell you something you’d be better off knowing about.’Pepper was perplexed but she did as she’d been asked.Tony wasn’t too fussed. Rhodey and Happy were more curious. Although, at least Tony was taking it seriously for once.‘I guess there’s a bit more to S.H.I.E.L.D. than they’d like us to believe,’ he mused. ‘JARVIS, can you hack in and get any files that have my name on them?’‘Of course, sir,’ JARVIS said.JARVIS came back, while all of them were sitting in Tony’s living room waiting on Sharee, with interesting data. Not only had Tony’s name been mentioned but so had his father’s – much more prominently. What JARVIS told them about the data around Tony’s name destroyed the good will that Coulson had managed to build up with them.‘It seems, sir,’ JARVIS said, ‘that they intend to try and acquire both money and resources from you without going through the appropriate channels.’‘You mean they want to just take it?’ Pepper asked. She was about to question how they intended to do that without having the legal department come down on them when a golden circle suddenly appeared in the wall across the room.It seemed to shift and it rotated.Then Sharee Pertinicle stepped through, as if it was a portal of out a sci-fi movie.She’d evidently heard the end of that because she said, ‘Nothing so mundane.’

S.H.I.E.L.D. had been bugging Potts’s conversation with the archaeologist.Fury got suspicious of the woman, especially after finding out that her late grandmother had ties to both Howard Stark and Peggy Carter. Did she know something about S.H.I.E.L.D.? He’d had Stark’s place bugged. However, no sooner did they settle to listen in than did a loud high-pitched continuous shriek emit from the receivers.The cameras were no good either. What should have been shots of the inside of Stark’s living room instead showed old Loony Toons cartoons. Through trying to correct the problem, his hackers found a message. It told him that whoever this Dr. Sharee Pertinicle was, she was a cocky little bitch.GAME ON, MOTHERFUCKERS Stark Mansion
‘What was that?’ Tony asked as Sharee flopped down onto the couch opposite them, dropping her backpack at her feet.‘Eh.’ Sharee shifted nervously. ‘What we named it to make it palatable to the people there doesn’t really apply to you, so we’ll call it a form of energy manipulation.’‘Energy manipulation?’ Pepper asked. ‘How long have you been able to do this?’Sharee smirked. ‘You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. But that’s not what we’re here for.’‘Right,’ Tony said, ‘S.H.I.E.L.D. My father was involved with them?’‘As their bankroller, political manoeuvrer, and scientific advisor, yes.’ Sharee leaned up. ‘And also their scapegoat. Let’s not forget scapegoat.’Tony frowned. It seemed so bizarre that someone could get away with using Howard, of all people, as a scapegoat. The old bastard had always been so snappy...Tony paused at that. Maybe there was a reason he’d been so snappy. ‘How did that come about?’Sharee groaned. ‘Peggy Carter and Project Rebirth.’ She leaned back and crossed her arms. ‘The reason that Howard was so obsessed with the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan was because he felt, somewhat incorrectly, that Captain America was the one thing he created that didn’t bring destruction to the world. I know of quite a few axis cities that would beg to differ.’Tony frowned. ‘How do you know that?’Sharee huffed. ‘My grandmother was familiar with your father in the 40s.’‘Wow,’ Happy remarked. ‘That’s a coincidence.’‘Yes, I’m tempted to break into a rendition of “It’s a Small World” but this isn’t a karaoke bar,’ Sharee said. ‘Anyway, because of that, Peggy Carter, as one of the few links he had left, was one of the few people whose opinion of him mattered to him. According to Grandma, that was his first mistake. Because Peggy Carter did not like him. She considered him an opportunistic, money-hungry, lecherous fool.’ She pointed at Tony’s surprised expression. ‘Grandma’s words, not mine. Grandma always said she’d give her the fool bit. The “letch” was debatable.’With that, Sharee reached into her jacket pocket and drew something out that glinted. As she held it up, Tony was shocked. In her hand she held an impeccable bracelet of diamond and gold. Tony leaned forward and held his hand out. Sharee placed the bracelet in his hand. Upon closer inspection, To
