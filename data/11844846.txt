Happy
The minute Peter arrived in the Avengers' lab, he knew something was off.For one thing, Mr. Stark was in some kind of funny looking polka dotted, gray pajamas and Peter's Spidey suit wasn't laid out on the table like it usually was when an upgrade was scheduled."That's not my new suit is it?" asked a worried Peter, his eyes trailing all over the pajamas.Mr. Stark glanced up at him, confusion flashing across his face. "What?" He glanced down at his unusual garb. "Oh, no. This is for Bruce. If he ever comes crawling back here. What are you doing here? In the neighborhood, thought you'd stop by?"It was Peter's turn to be confused. "We have an upgrade scheduled. You texted me, remember?""Oh, crap. I forgot." Mr. Stark glanced around, thinking about what to do. "Come back in two hours."Peter's eyes widened. "Two hours? What am I gonna do for two hours?"Mr. Stark cocked his head. "Hmm." His eyes brightened. "I'll put you on Happy Time." He turned away from Peter. "Fri, have Happy come to the lab."Peter immediately understood what Mr. Stark had in mind and began to protest."Mr. Stark, I don't need Happy to babysit me. I mean, we don't need to bother him. I saw him on my way up here. He was on Downton Abbey Time and I don't really wanna interrupt such an intimate… screening. I can just do my homework while I wait."Mr. Stark put up a finger, effectively silencing Peter's babbles. "Let me stop you there because the words that are coming out of your mouth make me want to hurl. A: Homework's boring. They still give those out? B: Happy's seen all the episodes of Downton Abbey, he won't be missing anything. And C: last time I left you without supervision, you hacked a multi-million dollar suit and went after a supervillain."Peter folded his arms and nodded. Mr. Stark had a point there.Peter's relationship with Happy had somewhat improved after the Vulture fiasco, but Peter knew Happy wouldn't be keen on watching him for two hours. Especially not if he could spend those hours watching his favorite TV show.A minute later Happy walked in, not too pleased at his Downton Abbey marathon having been disrupted."He's on Happy Time," Mr. Stark said to Happy by way of an explanation. Either he saw the look on Happy's face and didn't care or he saw the look on Happy's face and wanted to exacerbate matters. "Two hours. Think you can handle that?"Happy gave Mr. Stark a deadpan look. "What are we gonna do for two hours?"Peter nodded. "That's what I said!"Mr. Stark shrugged, turning to the heads-up display and studying the data that the Hulk Pajamas must be giving out."I don't know, learn how to drive a car. You're a teenager. You must be dying to get behind the wheel. Two hours and I swear I'm all yours."Peter and Happy turned to look at each other.This was going to be some two hours. ..."I'm driving that?" asked an incredulous Peter, his lips quirking upwards. His apprehension at spending two hours with a sour Happy turned into excitement.He and May have gone driving before in parking lots, so he wasn't really looking forward to relearning how to drive even if it was in the Avengers' compound. But driving an Audi, that's... Wow.The last Audi he drove had been stolen from Flash. The fact that he was chasing after Liz's dad at the time also meant he didn't get to milk that car for what it's worth. It had barely even registered to him that it was an Audi.Peter continued to stare at the Audi. If his memory served him right, this was Mr. Stark's car—a prototype. Audi wasn't even selling this yet!Peter exhaled. "That's worth more than May's apartment!"But Happy was probably too used to the once-in-a-lifetime Audi that he barely empathized and simply told Peter to get in the car."Can I just— a photo— Ned would freak!"Peter giddily took a selfie of himself with as much of the car as he could fit in the background. Then he took another one of the car alone. He sent it to Ned with the message, "GUESS WHO'S TAKING DRIVING LESSONS IN THIS BABY?""Get in the front seat," said Happy a second time, the impatient tone he used was something Peter was more than familiar with. Sometimes, Happy reminded him of an annoyed older brother.Peter cautiously approached the car. He ran his palm over the car door, his fingers cradling the door handle.Happy gave him a blank stare. "You know you've ridden in this before."Peter shrugged. "I know. But I was just a passenger during those times. Now, I'm the driver." He said the word in an exalted whisper.Finally, they both slid inside the front seats of the car.As soon as Peter shut the car door, his hands approached the wheel. He caught himself midway and drew his hands back, going instead for the seatbelt.He checked his mirrors and then looked at the array of buttons on the dashboard. Unfamiliar buttons.He turned to Happy."I've never driven an Audi before," Peter lied. Happy didn't need to know the last Audi he drove got wrecked. "I've only ever driven May's Honda."P
