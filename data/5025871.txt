Chapter Text
"Pregnant." The word seemed to echo through the room, bouncing off of the finely - and expensively - decorated walls."Pregnant?" His father repeated, voice seeped in disappointment. Tony looked up from his glass of scotch and stared at Howard."I'm going to be a dad." At this, Howard's eyebrows drew together and his mouth turned downwards. Tony stared pleadingly at his mother, but she ignored him. Instead focusing her attention at picking away at his father's favourite office chair. They were all sat in Howard's office. The room Tony had been terrified of his entire life. The oak furniture and dim lighting was intended to give of a warm, homely feel, but it made him jumpy. The room was steeped in too many bad memories of shouting matches, and the occasional bout of violence. He forced his darting eyes away from the towering bookshelves that lined the room and weakly looked at Howard."She doesn't want anything to do with it." He said, in a futile attempt to break the uncomfortable silence."Good." Howard rumbled, his frown lessening a fraction. "We can get rid of it easier that way." He rose to his feet and moved towards the ancient desk.Tony frowned. "Get rid of it?" He echoed. Howard nodded, pulling out a cigar from his desk and to his lips, lighting it and ignoring Maria's look of disdain."Abortion, adoption." He gestured with the cigar, looking so much like he could be talking about business. "It doesn't matter. As long as it's gone, you'll be okay.""Dad..." He said slowly, the words feeling like tar in his mouth. "I'm not getting rid of it." Howard barked out a sharp laugh."What are you going to do then Anthony? Raise it yourself?" Tony felt anger coil in the pit of his stomach at Howard's condescending tone."Are you saying that I couldn't do it? That I couldn't raise my own kid?" Tony's face pulled into a scowl at his response."You can barely look after yourself, let alone another goddamned human being!" Howard too another puff of the cigar, blowing out the dark smoke in a perfect ring."Tony, honey." Maria gently grabbed his hand. His stomach tightened at the pity in her eyes. "We all know what it would do to this family if this got out. Imagine the scandal it would cause!" Her voice turned incredulous, as if nothing could be worse.Tony felt a dull ringing in his ears and snatched his hand away from Maria. "Son, we've ignored your antics for now. With the drinking and the drugs, but this is one step too far. You need to get your act together or else-""What? Or else what?" Tony rudely cut Howard off mid-sentence. "You're going to disown me? Kick me out the family?" He felt his face flush as Maria looked away whilst Howard's mouth tightened. Tony suddenly felt sick, like he was going to throw up. "You actually would. You would actually kick out your son."Howard glared. "Now Tony, don't act like this is any of our doing. This is a last resort. You know as well as we do that you wouldn't make a good father. It would be stupid to try it."Tony felt like punching his dad in the face. "You know what dad? Fuck you. I'm going to be a better fucking dad than you ever will be." He slammed his scotch down on the table and stood."And how are you going to manage that, with no money, no future?" Howard viciously put his cigar out, before striding around the desk to stand directly in front of Tony. He stared down at his son angrily, trying to make his large frame as intimidating as possible.Tony glared back, his anger making him even taller. "I'll be a better dad than you." He hissed. "Because I am going to fucking love that kid more than life itself and do it unconditionally." With that, he turned around and strode out, Howard shouting after him the whole time.*****One week later, Tony started his first job at a fast food restaurant. Truthfully, he hated it.Burns from the deep fat fryer lined his arms and the smell of fries sunk deeply into his pores. He moved into permanent residence on his best friend Rhodey's couch at Culver university, and he collapsed there everyday at the end of a long nine hour shift.He sent half of his paycheck to his 'baby momma' and spent the rest on basic necessities. The money wasn't great, but it was constant and enough to keep his head above water.After two months of this, he landed a second job at the university lab. Originally, the director had been concerned with Tony's age and lack of credentials, but once Tony built a small robot in the space of ten minutes, the director gave him the job. He was now the university handyman (he preferred mechanic), he came to campus just as it was closing and fixed any odds and ends that the resident scientists had broken.The pay wasn't great here either, but it came with a small dorm room which was just enough for him. Tony had missed having his own space and was tied of relying on Rhodey, so the move was a great relief. He moved in the next day, dragging his small box of meagre possessions across campus. It was a very small
