Chapter Text
Bucky looked out the windows of the Wakandan jet. Sam had mentioned that they were almost home and Bucky was intrigued to see the Compound. However, he was also sad to leave Wakanda behind. He had made new friends in T'Challa and his sister, Shuri and he was going to miss them. Shuri promised to keep in touch though. Bucky brightened up when he recognised the Avengers symbol on the side of a large building. The voice in his head instantly mapped out the size, height and possible exits that he could already see. He probably wouldn't need the information but Bucky somehow felt safer knowing it.The jet touched down just outside the Compound. Bucky could practically feel the relief coming off of everyone in the jet. They were glad to be home. Bucky wasn't entirely sure whether he was yet.He let everyone leave ahead of him. He could already spot people waiting for them out of the jet windows and they didn't look particularly happy. He didn't want to be the centre of attention right now. He would happily stay on the jet until everyone was gone but he knew that wasn't an option. Not with Steve standing there waiting expectantly for him.He slowly made his way out of the jet. When Steve was confident that he would follow, he turned around and followed his group of friends. Bucky hung back and tried his best to not draw attention to himself.It had been six months since the fight in Siberia and Tony Stark had found out what Bucky had done to his parents. No matter what Steve said, he had killed Howard and Maria. He had killed all his victims.As he came to a stop, a few feet behind everyone else, he looked at the people waiting for them. Three of them he recognised but the other three he didn't. As soon as he had seen them, his brain was already making profiles on each person of information he knew and what he could see. He had to wait for information on the other three but it was soon given to him."Thor! Bruce! Where have you been?" Clint asked.The God of Thunder and the Hulk. HYDRA had been fascinated by the two of them. They didn't really care much for recruiting or using them but, even Bucky had to admit, the two strongest Avengers were interesting. He looked at the woman standing beside the two of them. The last one he didn't know."Friends, it is good to see you again," Thor said. "I have heard of what has transpired here on Earth and I hope we can all move on from it together."Bucky instantly liked Thor. And he wasn't the only one.***"I like him."*** "You? Trusting somebody?" Bucky joked.***"I said I liked him. I never said trusted."***"It takes a lot for you to like someone though."Bucky turned back to the conversation happening in front of him."Of course, Thor," Steve said. "This will be a fresh start."Bucky noticed movement and saw that both Tony Stark and James Rhodes were glaring at Steve. Steve hadn't seemed to have noticed. Actually none of Steve's friends had even glanced in Stark's direction since they had arrived."Who's your friend?" Sam asked.Thor turned to the woman standing next to him."This is Brunnhilde, the Valkyrie. A friend from Asgard.""Hmm. More Asgardians," Clint mused."Worry not my friends. I will explain everything once you are settled in. You have travelled a long way."Thor waved for them to follow him. Him and the Valkyrie led the others inside. Bucky couldn't help but notice that Bruce Banner had not spoken at all and spent the whole time avoiding Natalia's eyes. He saw the attempt to try and make eye contact with him that ultimately failed. There was obviously a history there. Bucky looked up at the Compound. It was quite tall. Bucky would easily be able to survive a jump from the roof to the ground. Truthfully, he didn't like tall buildings. Or anywhere up high. Being with HYDRA always made him feel like he was falling, letting go and plummeting to his doom. Jumping from that building in Bucharest had been horrible. Of course his training and the adrenaline rush had chased most of the anxiety away but it was still there, hidden away until it was ready to consume him."Barnes? You don't want to get left behind."Bucky looked down and saw that everyone, except Stark, Rhodes, Vision and Banner, were gone. Bucky ducked his head and went after the others. ***"You shouldn't let your mind wander the way you do."***"I can't always help it." ***"Good thing I'm watching out for you then."***Bucky's room was very ordinary. Just an ordinary apartment. It was perfect. He didn't like things being over the top. They could have put him in a cupboard and he would have liked it even better. Of course, he wasn't going to ask for a cupboard. Steve would go mental. So he settled for the large wardrobe. It
