7/23/21 Addition: If you prefer listening to reading, check out my attempt at recording this chapter in podfic form here. I'm reasonably confident it doesn't sound terrible. I can mimic the accents okay but not so much the deep voices of all these dudes. If anyone knows how to properly embed an audio player or a good free audio file hosting site besides google drive, please let me know so I can make this as convenient as possible for you guys to access. Also let me know if it sucks so that I can stop recording more chapters.  Thor hurled Stormbreaker towards Thanos. It cut through the power of all the Stones and struck home deep in the left shoulder. He landed behind it and bared his teeth in a mirthless grin. This was not a joyous victory, but damn if it was not a  satisfying  one. The arm hung useless and Thanos’s eyes were wide with pain and disbelief. Staring into those eyes without pity, Thor pushed the axe even deeper until it severed the arm completely.“What have you done?” Thanos gasped. “You’ve doomed us all! I would have saved the universe.”“You call it salvation, slaughtering half of my people when they were already but a fraction of Asgard’s numbers from mere weeks ago? Wiping out the dwarves and leaving only their king behind to suffer? You think yourself a just god, capable of making the hard choices. There is nothing in you but cruelty. My brother was right. You will never be a god.”Thanos tried to attack with his remaining hand, but with a mighty roar, Thor swung Stormbreaker again, this time for the neck. There was another spray of violet blood, followed by two more thumps. The Titan had fallen. “I told you you would die for that.”All around Thor, the battle was coming to an end. The gauntlet lay on the grass at his feet, still on Thanos’s severed arm. The green gem in the thumb setting faced upward.  Time.How little time it had taken for Thor to lose everything. His world. His friends. All but a pitiful remnant of his people. His entire family. It seemed incredible that he had cared so much about losing his hair and his hammer so recently. Neither mattered to him at all now, and what was losing an eye compared to nearly everyone he had ever loved?He had stopped Thanos. He had gotten his revenge. What was left for him now but to go back to the refugees who’d fled with the Valkyrie? Surely there was nothing else he could do. And yet...Thor wasn’t really thinking. Someone was calling his name—Rogers, perhaps. People were realizing Thanos had fallen. Thor barely heard them. He used the point of Stormbreaker’s purple-stained blade to pry the Time Stone free of the gauntlet, then bent down and picked it up.“Thor, what are you doing?” It was the rabbit. “You shouldn’t be holding one of those things in your bare hand.”Thor ignored him. He clenched his fist around Time hard enough to drive it into his flesh. Burning green light erupted from between his fingers, growing steadily brighter. He could suddenly see his entire life stretching out behind him. All those centuries of taking everything he had for granted. He saw the future stretching out ahead of him too, in all its possibilities. Many of them showed cause for hope. None showed the faces he longed to see again.Dimly, he could hear voices shouting at him to let the Stone go, but he would not. He clung to it even tighter, though the pain was building. He turned his gaze to the past and yelled as he felt himself unraveling.XThor felt a sensation not unlike missing a step when going down stairs. He was no longer on the battlefield on Earth, being consumed by green fire; instead, he found he was sitting on the steps in one of the feast halls in the palace. There was an overturned table, with food, plates, and cutlery strewn all across the floor. “What?” he breathed.Soft footsteps came from behind. He turned to see whose they were and felt like he’d been struck in the chest. Loki. Very much alive, though his hair was rather shorter than Thor was accustomed to of late. “Brother?” he said, getting to his feet. “Is this Valhalla?”Loki stared at him in confusion. “Valhalla? We are on Asgard. Why would you—”He didn’t get the chance to finish his question, because Thor had lifted him off his feet in a crushing hug. “Thor! What are you doing?” Thor only hugged him tighter. His little brother was really here, solid and warm and breathing—well, perhaps he was holding on too tight for that last one, but he was  alive.And that wasn’t all. “What’s this?!” Four people walked into the room, three of whom Thor had thought he would never see again. The tears that had begun building up the moment he saw Loki now flowed freely from his eyes—both of which he now realized felt like his own.He was dimly aware of Loki managing to push him off. “If not Valhalla, then surely this is a dream,” he said.“Brother, what is wrong with you? I thought you would be cros
