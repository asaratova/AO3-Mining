In the wake of Pepper Stark’s pregnancy announcement and Natasha Romanoff’s reinstatement as an active Avenger, the rest of the world seem to be moving at a record pace too fast for any one person to follow if they’re not a certified genius or trained and enhanced by the Red Room.The world pooled their resources like never before, predominantly with Wakanda’s limited and trickling contribution to the world. Even if the knowledge Wakanda allowed to publicly share to the world were limited to one specific information at a time, it still progressed the productivity of many groundbreaking discoveries and technology across the globe. But apart from being momentarily impressed by each new release of information, Tony was mostly interested with Wakanda’s shielding capabilities and the Black Panther armor.T’Challa’s sister, Princess Shuri, may not have been very forthcoming regarding the armor’s technology and armaments but after Tony shared his fears of another alien invasion, she was more than willing to help him with the shields so long as he provided her with information about BARF.Why the princess needed BARF was never discussed in their conference calls. (But between geniuses such as themselves, it never needed to be.)Beyond this, the greatest minds and experts worked tirelessly together to share their collective visions to innovate the world to a whole new era of technological, scientific, and magical wonder under the watchful eye and direction of Tony, Stephen, and T’Challa.Because no one wanted another Ultron and no one wanted another Kaecilius.After Hope persuaded and cajoled many other companies and organizations along with them, Stark Industries and Pym Technologies initiated self-sustaining foundations for scientific groups with revolutionary ideas and potential, ensuring that they were put to good use in more ways than just saving the planet from global warming and mass extinction.A great deal of Tony’s focus was dedicated to NASA and every other space station willing to collaborate with him, looking outward to the stars. This caused another stir with the press, the UN, and the scientific community as a whole. They commented on his loose hinges and overactive paranoia, unsuccessfully discrediting him as he ventured into the field of space travel and energy-sustaining global shielding technology.But Tony expected nothing less. After all, he never made it a secret that they needed to prepare for a higher form of war, that Earth needed to prepare. Deep down he knew that the threat is imminent, if not already coming. Many scoffed or laughed at him for his fear, that another invasion is impossible. That New York had been a fluke.While he wasn’t going to let them get in the way of protecting the things he can’t live without, Tony wished they’d prove him wrong.But he knew it wasn’t going to be enough. He knew they needed something more.One evening, Tony waited until he could feel Pepper’s breath even out in sleep before he got out of bed, took his phone, and dialed. He lounged on the sofa as he waited for the call to connect.“Stark,” Coulson answered without preamble.“I think that time is coming soon. Are the people on your end ready?”“As well as they can be.” Coulson answered without hesitation. “Are yours?”“No,” Tony answered truthfully. “But they will be. I trust that they will.”Coulson hummed. Tony smirked to himself at the thought of how baffled the former agent would’ve been to hear that Tony Stark trusted others to do their part. Tony has been trying to do some major character development as of late. Trusting his family and his team was the best and most obvious place to start.It took a moment for Coulson to answer. “I’ll inform Nick. Keep me posted.”“Will do.” Tony hung up.Now, all he had to do was wait. 
 Stark Industries and Pym Technologies (along with many government backing) provided high-tech gears and equipment to the Anti-Terrorist Units all over the world to give them a good fighting chance against magical and enhanced individuals that caused trouble inside their assigned jurisdictions.The Anti-Terrorist Units were born out of the idea that a country needed to be (at least, somewhat) independent from the Avengers when it came to dealing with advanced terrorism. Arguments of multiple attacks happening all at once across the globe or refusing to accept Avenger aid have been raised at some point during the revisions and continued well after the Accords were finalized and signed for the hundredth time.Since these arguments were concerned more of each country’s interests and not the world in general, the Avengers kept their distance from the debates but monitored the situation closely.In the end, the countries signed under the Accords decided that having the Avengers were not enough. They needed a response team with the ability to hold their ground against more powerful adversaries if the Avengers were unavailable for deployment or elsewhere.Hence, the Anti-Terrorist Units or ATU were f
