Chapter 1: Do we live in a simulation?
    




Chapter Text

[You have died. Start New Game+?]


[ ] Yes


[ ] No


I stared at the floating text thinking about nothing but how I laughed when my friend texted me at 3 in the morning once worried that life was all just a game. Now looking around in what I could only call the void with only those words with me, I’m wondering if she might have been correct.


I just finished my junior term of uni and was vacationing with my friend. We were hiking in broad daylight, and I’ve been in that area so many times before. We weren’t even drinking! The fact that I slipped and fell seems so... out of character for me. I usually have excellent balance. 


But I realized it did happen, and from the sounds of this, I have a chance to do it over again.


I raised my hand over the 
Yes
 for just a second before...


[x] Yes


[...Starting New Game+]

[Character Creation]


[ ] Import Character


[ ] New Character


My eyes drew to the new character button, but I kept my hands to my side. I enjoyed my life, and had no issue with my body, but having a learning disability sucked and if I had the option to be normal...


[x] New Character

[Sex]


[ ] Female


[ ] Male


[ ] Intersex


Intersex is interesting, but I did say I wanted a chance at a normal life, so I focused on the female option. Though not having periods would also be nice, but I’m not sure if I want to deal with being a trans woman for this life. At least not with how society is. 


[x] Female


[Other options will be randomized based off later selections]


[World State Selection]


[ ] 
Apocalypse Now



You wake up during an apocalyptic event. The world has ended, and the remnants of humanity are struggling to survive in their new reality. What happened to the world is up to you, but be aware that life as you know it has ceased to exist. 


[ ] Parallel


You awaken in a world disarmingly similar to your own, only with a few very solid differences. The choices are yours, from an entire world of genderswapped humans to having dogs be the dominant species on Earth. Perhaps America lost the Cold War, or the Industrial Revolution was postponed for a century. Whatever the case, nothing will be the way you remember it. 



[ ] 
Stranger Than Fiction 



You find yourself transported to a fictional world, with all the dangers and excitement therein. The world is chosen at random, but it will be one that you are at least passably familiar with. As recompense, you will be awarded an additional Talent Point.



[ ] 
The Gamer



Your life is a video game, and you can treat it as such. Awards [Gamer’s Mind] and [Gamer’s Body] Status Effects. The world you find yourself in is chosen at random, and it may not be one you are familiar with.  



Right away I mentally crossed off apocalypse now as an option. That is not something I ever want to live in given the option. I was drawn to “stranger than fiction”, since I read a lot of fanfics and my favorite was the si/oc reincarnation that was so popular in the Naruto fandom. However, the Gamer was also interesting. Isn’t this already a game? Or when I start it will be like real life again. I wasn’t sure what was meant by gamer mind and body, but I assumed it was something like pause menu and sleeping off status ailments. Being able to save and reload sounded really useful...

The Gamer


I didn’t even raise my hand for that one. It just selected for me.


[Selecting World. Please Wait...]


I saw a list of title roll past too fast for me to read all of them, but a few caught my eye. Harry Potter being and I wouldn’t mind being in, and One piece being one I only know of but never read/watched. It slowed down until there was only one title left.


[Marvel Universe]


That wasn’t too bad. Sure I’ve only seen maybe half of the movies, and I’m still not sure what’s Marvel and DC and something else. Being a superhero would even be fun. Sure I wanted to be normal, but that was before I realized that new game didn’t mean I would be living my life over again. And who doesn’t want to be a hero?


[Skill Selection]



You have been awarded 


Three


 Tale points based on the Completion Status of your previous game. Each Talent may only be taken once unless Specified otherwise. Effects are cumulative.



[ ] The Wolverine: 

You heal from injuries faster than people can make them using conventional means. Death is still possible, but anything less than full atomic annihilation can be brushed off with enough time to heal. Vulnerable to drowning and suffocation.  



[ ] Alabaster: 

You reset to a pristine condition every 4.3 seconds. This includes physical wounds, poisons or status effects, physical mutations, and any damage to anything you are wearing or holding at the time of reset. If you are utterly destroyed before a reset completes, you will perish.
