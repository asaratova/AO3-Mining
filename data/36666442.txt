One â€“ Vague Unease
When O'Keefe walked into the SHIELD office she shared with Loki, his scowl deepened to epic proportions. "I didn't even give you the lowdown on what we're working on yet," she said, giving him an arch look.Loki leaned back in his chair, a sour expression on his face. "It's going to have to do with that magic user they were talking about in the break room, isn't it? The one that Higgins not-so-subtly implied was my victim.""Which is stupid, because it happened when you were in a room full of highly trained people that would know if you ducked out and did something so stupid," O'Keefe replied, dropping down heavily into her own seat. "And not to mention, where it was obvious you were sloshed, so there is no way in hell you'd pop open a portal, kill a stranger with exceedingly straight cuts in the shape of runes, then pop back in the middle of a dance routine that is so epically legendary that I refuse to delete the video from my phone."Wincing at hearing it stated so baldly, Loki's gaze skipped down to the folder in her hands. "Does this mean that your superiors think me blameless?""Our superiors," O'Keefe corrected, launching the folder across the space between their desks and mirroring his posture. "And no, they never thought this was you, that was Higgins being an ass and trying to impress Reyes. She knows better than to fall for his bullshit."Taking the folder with careful movements, Loki paused and looked up at her. "He isn't the only one to distrust me.""Because you're not a ray of sunshine in the bullpen," she replied easily, taking in his stark black suit, emerald green shirt and black tie. "You look ready for a funeral.""I'm being quite formal here.""Just shy of tactical gear, is it?"Loki rolled his eyes. "I don't need it if there is spellwork woven into my clothing.""Higgins being an ass doesn't mean that people listen to him, Loki. The others distrust you because they think bad shit is going to go down."He gave her an unamused look. "Because it so often does.""See? You're not a ray of sunshine. That gets depressing. We have a hard enough time with the cases they're throwing at us.""Most practitioners have no idea what they're doing," Loki huffed, lips pursed. He opened the folder, scanning its meager contents. "Or is it that those building the files have no idea what they're doing?""All of the above, likely." O'Keefe grinned at him. "Are you surprised?"Loki shrugged, unable to shake the unease that was slithering around his gut. He didn't know what to say in response that wouldn't sound maudlin or like he was fishing for compliments. O'Keefe had long since proved she wouldn't harm him, but old habits died hard. He'd saved her life, and never once regretted it, but perhaps this feeling was that debt rising up to make itself known?"What is it?" she asked, brows knit in concern.He troubled her, which was not his intent. He shrugged again. "I've helped, haven't I?" he asked after a moment, lips pursed. She blinked but otherwise remained silent. "With SHIELD. With cases. With identifying magic.""You know you have," O'Keefe said slowly, no doubt wondering where he was going with this."But they still disparage me," he said quietly. "I've helped. Under duress at first, certainly, and it doesn't erase my earlier crimes, of course." He folded his hands over his stomach as he leaned further back, unease showing in his expression. O'Keefe had earned this level of trust. "Shannon was right, I'd have gone mad if I remained idle and locked away in a cell somewhere. In this manner, I can earn some kind of redemption. I have done no harm in this position, yet they still assume the worst of me.""Higgins is an asshole." She tilted her head, contemplating him. "But this isn't just about Higgins, is it?" When Loki shook his head, she frowned. "So what is it?""I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. I don't feel right."O'Keefe was concerned, which warmed the empty holes in his soul a fraction. "Like an illness? I didn't think you could get sick.""It's not an illness," he sighed."Or are you feeling the bad mojo that this is causing?" she asked, gesturing toward the file. At his look of surprise, she shot him a mirthless smile. "I've learned some things since being paired off with you, Loki. I may not have magic, but I can still learn how the underpinnings work so I can help you."He nodded in acknowledgment and tapped the file folder. "This is pathetic. We need to go there and see what actually happened."She grinned openly at him. "Like actual SHIELD agents, you mean."Loki's lips twisted in distaste. "You're the one with the badge.""Use the one I got you.""Consultant," he said, as if the term was offensive."Official consultant," O'Keefe teased. "It means you bypassed training, not that you're not an agent."That didn't appease him. "Something bad is coming.""Something always is," O'Keefe agreed. She leaned forward and crossed her arms over her desk. "So
