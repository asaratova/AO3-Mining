Chapter 1: The Mortal
    




Chapter Text
In hindsight, she probably should have brought her coat. She wasn’t sure what made her decide to leave her coat in the lab. Stupidity probably. It was a classic bitterly cold January night in London’s back alleys and to leave any building without an overcoat was either a death wish or pure stupidity. She bargained on the latter. However, living only a few blocks away it did not bother her. She knew the alleys well after a year of working between the MI5 and Scotland Yard and had nothing to fear from the drunks, homeless or anyone else due to the cold. Snow began to fall lightly. She sighed in a similar manner to the falling flakes; quietly. In a loose white peasant shirt, she shivered and scanned the small street in front of her. It was quiet, empty bar a tall figure leaning against a street light not 20 meters from where she was walking.  The snow was illuminated by the dying streetlight but it did nothing to identify the figure. Knowing the risks of stopping, she continued to process him as she neared his position: Tall, male, buff, well clothed, a beard possibly or just long hair- it was hard to tell. 5 meters from him and the man shifted his position, allowing himself to be fully illuminated by the flickering street lamp. He was now standing directly in her path, clad in what appeared to her as armour. Steel breast plates, shoulder plates, leather pants and to add insult to injury, a bright red cape which brushed the ground. She stopped a few meters in front of him, her eyebrows raised somewhat skeptically. She said nothing. He appeared to survey her curiously and she met his eyes with a certain amount of forced hostility. “You are Lady Alina Everton?” His voice was deep and rumbling with power. “I am. May I help you?” The man smiled. “Indeed you can. I am Thor of Asgard and it would be greatly appreciated if you would come with me.” “I most certainly will not go anywhere with you Mr…. Asgard?” Alina replied sarcastically She could've sworn she heard a chuckle from the alley to the left of her. Brashly, she reached for her waist only to remember she did not have either of her guns. Thor noticed.“We mean you no harm” Alina jerked her head up. “We?” She queried “Yes…. we” A voice drawled from behind her.Reflexively, Alina turned to face the second man and found herself face to face, or rather face to neck with a tall, dark haired man with piercing green eyes. She tensed up more so, careful not to step backwards into the blonde man. At 5’7” she had to look up to glare at the man in the eyes. He didn’t appear in the least threatened. “We require your participation Miss Everton” Thor spokeAlina turned to him. She was aware of extraterrestrial appearances after her work in New York but this felt different. They were different. They looked human to a certain extent barring the odd get up and armour which they sported. “And what do you need my participation with?” She asked “We need you to come with us. All will be explained”“That will not be happening sir” she replied indignantlyLoki grabbed her from behind, wrapping around her forearms and holding her firmly against his chest. Alina didn’t move. It felt as if the whole scene had frozen. Thor remained still, looking down at her, Loki kept her still against his chest, she did not struggle. The only thing moving was the snow falling and gathering at their feet. A single light was on in an apartment but there was no noise. Thor and Alina stared at one another, reaching an impasse.Thor nodded to Loki and turned around, walking away. Loki followed, dragging Alina with him. For some odd reason a calmness had come over her, she felt lethargic and unable to find the energy to move or fight back. Instead she went limp, allowing the raven hair man to drag her along with him. They were now stood in the middle of the road and Loki dropped her body into the snow. She could have sworn she saw the curtain pull back in a window and a face peer out.Thor gave him a pointed look. Loki rolled his eyes.“Do we leave?” Loki asked“Indeed. I imagine we shouldn’t keep people waiting. You know how father is”Loki sneered.Alina began to shiver a little but lacked the energy to even prop herself up anymore. As she lay on her side, her eyes began to flicker and she felt the overwhelming urge to close them and sleep. Her training said no and she fought the feeling fiercely. At this thought, Loki glanced down at her with raised eyebrows. “Loki?” Thor queried “She’s fighting my enchantment”“Loki now is no time to court a lady” Thor lectured “No you imbecile I mean she’s fighting the magic. She should be out cold by now”“You know the circumstances” Thor said with a lowered voice.Both men looked down at her and Alina did her utter best to attempt a glare back up at them. “Let’s go” Thor spokeLoki lifted her into his arms.“Heimdall” Thor roaredBefore her vision was attacked by flashes of colour and blackness, Alina could have sworn she heard vehicles ski
