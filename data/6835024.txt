Chapter 1: The Fight
    




Chapter Text
Steve falls to the ground, grunting as his shoulder collides with the harsh floor. He pushes himself up to a sitting position, watching as the Iron Man suit whirls and stands tall. Tony raises a hand, pointing the repulser at Steve, and says, “stand down.”As if.Steve stands up, bracing himself for a fight. He’s never stood down––not against the bullies before the serum, not against Hydra at World War II, not against Loki or Ultron… and certainly not now. “I could do this all day.”The repulser lights up as the beam begins to build, and Steve takes a deep breath once Tony fires, bracing himself for the impact.But then, his shield is there, flying his way, and Steve grabs it. Adrenaline rushes through his system once again as he blocks the beam and rolls on the ground, then jumping up and smashing his shield into the Iron Man suit before Tony has the time to fight back. Tony fires another beam, but Steve blocks it again.Soon, Bucky is at his side. Steve doesn’t hesitate to throw the shield over to Bucky, who catches it effortlessly and and hits the Iron Man with it. They exchange the shield, blocking hits and sending them, and all Steve can see is red. He can’t really think––he just wants to keep Bucky safe, and Tony had tried to kill him.Steve will not let anyone lay a finger on Bucky again.But Tony manages to get a hit on Steve, knocking him to the ground once more. Bucky is immediately enraged, shoving his metal arm into the suit’s arc reactor and pushing into it relentlessly. The Iron Man clashes against a wall, and Bucky pushes into the reactor core with greater pressure, cracking more and more of the reactor.
The HUD is blaring for Tony, with beeps and colours and warnings. The reactor is providing less and less energy to power the suit, and Bucky won’t stop, and this man killed his parents, and Steve had known and had kept it a secret from him––He grinds his teeth, and sends full power to the reactor, releasing a powerful unibeam of energy directly into Bucky’s arm.And the arm gets blown right off.Tony lets out a shaky breath as he watches the man fall to the ground, shock–-and perhaps pain?––evident on his face.When Steve approaches Tony with deadly anger, Tony finds that he has suddenly lost the energy to fight back. The shield hits him once, twice, and a few times more… and Tony cannot attempt to block it.He stares at Bucky, lying on the ground, wincing.Oh, God, he thinks. Fuck, I lost it. Fuck. Jesus Christ. I fucking lost it. He looks at Steve again, through the flashing lights on his HUD. Oh, shit, Barnes was brainwashed. Shit, this is exactly what Zemo just fucking said he wanted––to tear us up from the inside out. And I fell for his fucking tactics, shit, fuck.He lost control, gotten blinded by anger.Shit.Steve shows no sign of calming down. Instead, he begins to hit Tony's helmet even stronger, alternating between punches and clashes with the shield. There is no kindness in his eyes, no remorse, only anger.But––if Steve had told him, if he’d been truthful, then Tony would not have been so shocked at watching the footage, would not have gotten so angered and hurt by Steve’s secrets, would not have lunged at Barnes in such animalistic behaviour.So he takes the hits, attempting to process the situation at hand. Steve is now fighting him because he attacked Bucky, but he'd attacked Bucky because he hadn’t been told about a very important secret and had simply not had the time to process it beforehand.Just what a shitbag like Zemo wanted.He's unsure when he'd fallen to the ground, or how long Steve has been hitting him for, before the helmet breaks off. Suddenly, Tony's eyes meet Steve's, and they pause for a moment... but only for a moment. Soon, Steve raises the shield again, preparing to send it crashing down into Tony's skull, and Tony feels a different tinge of panic build up inside him. At another time––perhaps even during their fight at the airport––Tony would not have, for a second, thought that Steve would actually kill him with the shield.And yet, the look on Steve's face tells Tony that he would not hesitate to kill him in this very moment. Tony gets it, then. Understanding settles into his mind, but also his heart. He finds an awful empty sensation, one drained of anger and bitterness and hatred, and filled with longing, remorse and pain instead.Tony had attacked Bucky, could have killed him. Steve was willing to end Tony's life for trying.Tony's vision begins to dim at the edges, and he finds himself bringing up his arms over his head, crossing them, as an attempt to block Steve's shield. At first he hesitates to do it, debating whether or not he deserved this hit––this death.The shield doesn't clash with his arms. Tony begins to let out a shaky sigh of relief, but his breath is cut off abruptly as the weight of the armour presses down onto his chest with immense force. Steve had sent the shield crashing into his the suit's reactor.He can hear S
