 After an hour in the pool, Nat dragged herself out and said, “Uncle.” Lila laughed and hoisted herself up to sit next to her.“You can’t say Uncle, Auntie Nat…”“Sure I can,” she murmured bumping her shoulder to Lila, tracking Cooper as he bounded off the diving board and did a flip into the water. The kid was a capable swimmer, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t aware of his moves. Steve and James were keeping watch too, but they were kicked back under the shade of a tree talking to Clint while Nate climbed over the three of them, taking turns on where he would settle. Currently, he was sprawled across Steve, staring up at him with toothy wonder.It made Nat grin to see Steve playing with him, and no matter that it seemed he was focused on whatever Clint was saying, he didn’t miss a move the toddler made.Her heart gave a vicious little shake.Lila poked her again, and she glanced down at her. “Are we done?”“I think I am,” she admitted. “I’m beat.”“You’re getting old, Auntie Nat,” Lila told her seriously, and Nat chuckled.“You might be right,” she pushed upward and headed for her lounger to grab her hat and sunglasses. Lila trotted right after her and picked up a baseball cap and slipped it into place, then squinted up at her.“I don’t have sunglasses.”“Well, we’ll have to find you some.” She grabbed the sarong off the seat and tied it around her waist before flopping back on the lounger, despite her playfulness exhaustion wound through her muscles.“I have an idea,” Lila announced.“Does it require a cunning plan?”“Maybe,” Lila dragged out the word, and Nat cracked an eyelid open to study her. The light dancing in Lila’s eyes was hard to ignore. This was the part where Laura and Clint usually told Nat she was spoiling the kids. It was also the part where Nat usually ignored them because it was fun and she didn’t get to do it often.“Read me in.”“Coop!” Lila bellowed before she scooted forward on her lounger to whisper her idea into Nat’s ear. Cooper bounded over and dripped cool water onto her heated skin as he joined them.Shell hunting by the waves.She could do that.Blowing out a breath, she sent them off for shorts, more sunscreen and a proper hat for Coop. Like her, he freckled even if his were lighter in nature than hers. On her feet, she wandered over to Clint and the boys.“Tired?” Steve studied her, seeing way too much and her initial instinct to cover it up was as much a reflex as anything. Part of letting them look after her was being honest.“A little,” she admitted. The incident with the formless had left her with zero stamina. “But we’re going shell hunting on the beach, and I can handle a walk.”“The kids can wait,” Clint said, and she shook her head.“I want to go. Come with?” Yes, she wanted to push herself a little. James gave her an assessing look and then nudged Steve.“Yep.” Steve said without needing James to verbalize the question, because he was already standing up. Nate gave her a sleepy eyed look and Steve handed him over to Clint who settled the little one against his chest. Nat ran her fingers through his dark hair. He was so sweet.“I should slug you,” she told Clint with a cheerful smile.“I’m base, so I’m safe.” He retorted. “Besides. Seeing them is good for you. Not to mention you’re the one who wants to go for a walk. So—shoo.”Letting Steve and James conspire against her was one thing, but letting Clint recruit them was a terrible idea. Still, she really didn’t have it in her to complain. “How long can you all stay?”“We have to leave early tomorrow,” he told her. “And Laura has dibs on you for after dinner.”“Okay.”She caught Steve’s hand and wandered over to meet the kids at the shelf steps leading down onto the sand.The next hour or so passed swiftly, but she enjoyed watching Coop and Lila shell hunt. The sand was warm. If it got too hot, she’d wander toward the surf and let the water rush over her feet and cool her legs. Steve watched her nearly as much as he watched the kids, though they were both laughing at their antics. When the fatigue had her swaying, he rounded them up and gave Lila a ride on his shoulders before herding them back toward the house.Laura had lunch laid out, and there was laughter, and stories and Nat fought to stay awake at least until Laura sent her and Lila both in to watch movies. Her nap lasted about ninety minutes, but when James brushed his knuckles against her cheek, she rallied. The afternoon was board games, and who knew that Steve Rogers could clean up at Monopoly or that Clint would cheat at the game of Life—well she knew that one—but her favorite was when they resorted to Pictionary. Coop and Steve were killing it with their art skills but James and Clint were hilarious and Nat loved the subtle and sometimes not so subtle dirty references in their clues.Fortunately, Laura didn’t murder any of them as it went over t
