Chapter Text
You felt a sharp pain on the side of your head that forced you awake. When you opened your eyes the first thing you saw was the forest floor beneath you, covered in leaves. You felt disoriented and struggled to pick yourself up but did so anyway. You had a dull ringing in your ears and your body ached, but you staggered to your feet. As you looked around at your surroundings you realized you had no idea where you were, where you came from, and where to go. The only thing you seemed to remember was that you had to leave now. It was as if there was a voice in the back of your head telling you that you weren’t safe and that something bad would happen to you. You didn’t know what or why, but you didn’t want to find out.  With as much strength that you could muster you limped your way through the forest. The uneven terrain made it difficult for your injuries. From what you could tell you had a sprained ankle, bruised ribs, and an injury to your right temple. The injury on your head hurt the most and was the one making you disoriented.  As you continued to struggle you heard a loud sound coming behind you. It sounded mechanical and made you very uneasy as if you’ve heard it before. Panic started to rise in your chest making you move faster but whatever was the cause of that sound just kept getting closer and closer. No matter how fast you forced yourself to move your injuries slowed you down. Before you could process it, something knocked you back to the ground. You cried out due to your injuries and tried to get back up but the weight on your back didn’t budge. “Make this easier for both of us and just stay down,” a mechanical voice said above you. You turn your head and look at the red and gold figure standing over you. It had its right foot on your back and was most likely the thing you heard chasing after you. You didn’t know if it was a robot or just some flashy piece of armor, all you knew was that you didn’t trust it and it didn’t trust you. As you tried moving again it looked you directly in the eye and aimed a hand at you. Its hand started to glow a bright blue and you could hear it making a sound as if it were charging up. “It won’t kill you, but it’ll hurt like hell.” You stopped moving and glared, “You’re hurting my ribs.” “Maybe you should have thought of that before you tried to kill me and my friends,” it told you. Confused by what it was talking about you decided to shut up and just wait to see what happened next.  You both stayed like that for a few minutes until you heard more people walk out from behind the trees. With your face pressed to the ground, you couldn’t see them but from the sound of their footsteps, it sounded like you were severely outnumbered. “Told you I would catch them,” red and gold said above you. “Surprised they went down so easily,” you heard a deep voice respond. The weight on your back came off but just as quickly you felt someone slap cold metal cuffs to your wrists. You were then roughly forced to stand on your feet. “Where are your friends,” a man in a red white and blue outfit asked you. You stared at him blankly making him glare at you. He pressed you harshly against a tree making you flinch. “Where are they?!” You continued to just stare at him until a red-headed woman in a black tactical suit spoke up. “Maybe they don’t speak English.” “Oh no, they do,” red and gold told her. “Let’s start over with an easier question,” the guy who had you pinned said. “What’s your name?” “I- I don’t know,” you told him honestly. Even if you did know, the voice in the back of your head was telling you to stop speaking. You didn’t think it mattered though; you can’t give anything up if you didn't know anything. That’s when you finally realized you couldn’t remember anything. You couldn’t remember your name, your age, where you were born. You can’t remember anything before you woke up half an hour ago, it was all blank.  “That’s not funny,” the guy told you. “I’m not joking,” you shot back, “I don’t remember anything.” The man looked over at his companions who seemed just as confused as him. Nobody seemed sure how to continue until the redhead from earlier decided to approach you. She grabbed your chin and tilted your face to get a better look at your head injury. She stared for a few seconds before letting you go and turning to the others. “I think we should get them checked out by a doctor.” Multiple people started to protest but she simply grabbed your arm and led you away. She held onto you, helping you in keeping pressure off your ankle. Her friends followed closely behind murmuring to each other and glancing at you often. “Where are you taking me?” you whispered to her. “To a doctor. That injury looks serious,” she told you. You were led onto a plane where you were instructed to sit in a seat in the back. With your arms still cuffed behind you, someone else had to strap you in. After the plane took off and throughout most of the journey
