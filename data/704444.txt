Clint blinked at his computer blearily, the screen blurring for a second before he looked away and scrubbed his face roughly. It was enough to refocus him on the task at hand, namely finishing his report so he could finally get some proper sleep. The three meagre hours he had gotten on the transport back had helped him through the mandatory medical and debriefing with Sitwell and Hill, but now that he was in his quarters he could feel himself fading fast.The op had been a complete clusterfuck. Sitwell had done what he could, but then no one could have predicted that a car would lose control and crash into the parked SHIELD van where the strike team had been awaiting Clint’s green light, or that a carefully planned extraction would turn into a free-for-all between rival gangs. In the chaos that had followed, Clint and the two agents Sitwell had saddled him with – his so-called back-up – had been cut off from the ground team and left to fend for themselves until they could make it to the rendezvous point.It had taken them close to thirty-five hours, and during that time Clint had caught himself thinking more than once that things would have been a lot easier had he been on his own instead of responsible for keeping two agents on their first field assignment alive. To be fair, past the initial freak-out – which Clint hadn’t hold against them – Abrahams and Jin had handled themselves reasonably well, doing what he told them when he told them without asking stupid questions. Still Clint had never been happier to see Sitwell and the rest of the – slightly banged-up – team than when they had met up at the extraction point, and he had handed his charges over with much relief.He was writing a side-note on the two rookies’ field work when someone knocked. Clint groaned – he just wanted to finish this and go to sleep already –, but before he could tell them to go away whoever it was had already pushed the door open. Clint tensed reflexively and then relaxed almost immediately – just Natasha.“Hey,” he said with a tired smile. “Thought you were out.”The two of them had something of a system in place: when they weren’t in the field together they stopped by the other’s quarters to let them know they had made it back okay. A text message would have been easier, but they both tended to downplay injuries and so a visual confirmation had been put in place. It had used to include Phil too, but it was a moot point more often than not these days – he usually went in the field with one if not both of them. And when he didn’t, well, Phil always did know everything.It wasn’t a flawless system by far, and when Natasha hadn’t answered his knock earlier Clint had assumed she was busy elsewhere or out on assignment. He would have found out eventually – she obviously had.“I was at the gym,” she told him, sitting sideways at the head of the bed with her back against the wall. Clint yawned. “Why aren’t you in bed?”“I’ve got to finish this,” he said, nodding at his half-completed report, and she rolled her eyes at him.“You know Sitwell won’t care if you send it tomorrow. He’s probably asleep already.”Clint gave her a one-shoulder shrug. She was probably right. But if there was one thing Clint took pride in it was being good at his job. Filing a mission report with his supervisory agent within twelve hours of being back on base was part of his job – not one he particularly enjoyed, granted, and maybe only junior agents actively tried to meet that deadline, but it helped Clint put the mission behind him. Natasha knew that.“Suit yourself,” she said, picking up a book from his bedside table and flipping through the first pages. Apparently satisfied with her selection she settled down more comfortably and started reading while Clint went back to his report.Thirty minutes later his eyes were hurting when he finally hit send. He turned the computer off and dragged himself across the few feet that separated the desk from the bed, flopping down gratefully. His feet dangled off the far end, and he scowled half-heartedly at the ceiling. That wouldn’t do.He poked Natasha until she deigned to move, sitting against the headboard instead. With a satisfied sigh Clint moved up the bed, his feet firmly back over mattress. He was still missing his pillow – Nat must have stolen it – but he could live with that.“Dinner?” he asked through a yawn, and Natasha snorted.“Sleep,” she said firmly and he hummed in response, his eyes already closing. He startled awake a few hours later, his heart pounding with the remnants of an old nightmare. Natasha was still there, her fingers tracing idle circles in his hair. It was nice – soothing – and Clint thought he mumbled something to that effect unintelligibly.“Go back to sleep,” she told him but she didn’t stop, and so he did. The next time Clint woke up, it was a little after 6 am and Natasha was gone. It was easy to swallow the disappointment – he had had a lot of practice. For a brief moment, he considered get
