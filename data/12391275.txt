Tony wasn’t very comfortable with running around in Wakanda like he belonged there.It was still hard to believe some days that T’Challa really wanted him to be there, and he knew that he was bothering the Dora Milaje more than he should, so he really didn’t want to impose on the people in Wakanda as well.So he stayed in the palace most of his time, always close to T’Challa, because he still wasn’t sure about his place there.The revised Accords still weren’t through, mostly because a lot of people were unhappy with the changes made to them and so the emotions were high strung on that topic.Rhodey was doing better, almost walking without another aid but the braces, and being away from everything, relaxing in Wakanda, did wonders for him too.Bucky was still somewhere in cryo in the palace, but Tony didn’t know where and he really didn’t want to anyway. Steve and the rest of the team were long gone again; T’Challa’s hospitality only covered so much, and so there was no danger for Tony to run into any of them.Which was just fine with Tony, given that he still woke up with nightmares about the shield coming down more nights than not.T’Challa was always understanding, right there by his side, holding Tony afterwards and mumbling soothing words into his hair.Tony didn’t really understand how he all deserved this, how he managed to snatch up someone as amazing as T’Challa, but he wasn’t about to question it too hard. There was a good chance that it would be snatched away from him if he questioned T’Challa’s decisions and so Tony just accepted it for the miracle it was.Since Tony didn’t like walking around without T’Challa by his side he hadn’t met that many Wakandan citizens but apparently they were mostly in favour of Tony, simply because he made T’Challa happy.Tony was baffled about that, but he was also grateful that there was no outright hostility against him. He didn’t want to put T’Challa to the test, but he was fairly certain that T’Challa’s affection wouldn’t hold up against the demands of his people.That still didn’t change the fact that he went to dinner with T’Challa when he asked.“Love, what’s bothering you?” T’Challa asked during their dinner and Tony realized with a start that he had been mostly quiet this whole time, which was unusual for him at the best of times.“Nothing,” Tony tried but T’Challa levelled him with that look that meant he was calling Tony out on his bullshit without actually saying anything and Tony sighed.“I’m not so sure your people like me,” Tony mumbled towards his food and T’Challa immediately looked around.The Dora Milaje were standing a bit away from them, keeping their distance to give them privacy, but close enough to step in if anything should require it. They looked indifferent, but going by the slightly widened eyes T’Challa immediately noticed the looks of the other people in the diner.They were eyeing Tony mostly, and while some displayed just the normal amount of interest, a lot more were unfriendly or outright hostile.T’Challa tensed and Tony was sorry that he even mentioned it. He hadn’t wanted to ruin their date.“Is that why you don’t go out much?” T’Challa asked him and Tony reluctantly nodded.“Has anyone said anything to you?” T’Challa inquired further and now his voice was a bit sharper.“No,” Tony admitted. “It’s just me being…,” he had wanted to say ‘scared’ but T’Challa didn’t let him.“Nonsense. You shouldn’t have to feel scared here, this was supposed to be like a vacation for you,” T’Challa told him and it was then that one of the other patrons got up and walked up to their table.Okoye immediately stepped forward but T’Challa waved her off while Tony tried to make himself smaller.The man clearly had a problem with Tony, going by the burning glance he threw Tony, and Tony had feared this all along.Not even because of himself, he was used to this kind of thing, but it threw a bad light on T’Challa and Tony was still somehow convinced that if T’Challa heard what his people thought he would come to his mind and break up with Tony.The man stopped right in front of Tony, who kept his glance firmly on this food.“Murderer,” the man started without any regard for his king as it seemed and Tony could barely suppress a flinch.“You are a murderer, Stark, loyal to no one but yourself, and you might have bewitched our king but don’t make the mistake to believe that we will ever bow to you, consort or not. You are no one to us, and we won’t welcome you here,” the man said and his voice was cutting.Tony didn’t react much, apart from taking a few deep breaths, but T’Challa stood up, demanding attention just by that.The man immediately turned to his king, but Tony could tell that he wasn’t about to back off.“My king,” the man said, with just the minimum amount of respect.“Maybe you want to say that again?” T’Challa asked and the man straightened up.“Sure do. He is a murderer and he shouldn’t even be allowed in the country, let alone in your bed,” the man said and Tony
