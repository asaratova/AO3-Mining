Chapter 1: Start Your Engines!
    




Chapter Text
Peter Parker took a step forward, it was not his first step nor his last step on his journey, but it was one more step. He glanced up to stare at the looming awning, which had the distinctive “UA” placed at the peak. His hands shook slightly and his palms felt clammy. It was ridiculous that he was acting this way, he had faced down Captain America, and yet he was sweating an entrance exam. To be fair, one out of three hundred weren’t great odds, but he had backup schools, all of which were great schools. Though, something told him that this was it, he had to make it into this school. Maybe it was his Tingle, that had finally come back from the dead, trying to warn him that he would only be safe at this school. It made more sense, though, with U.A.’s reputation, that going here simply felt right.He had arrived extremely early, maybe a little too eager to take an exam. In his defense, this would be the first time in a while he would be able to actually fight. Or at least that’s what he assumed he would be doing in the practical portion of the exam. He went up to the sign-in table, manned by student volunteers. At least that’s what the news article he had read said, but it was pretty easy to deduce from their U.A. uniforms.“What was your guys’ entrance exam like? I can’t believe I’ve never asked! Did you faint? Did you throw up? I’m sure you were nervous, Tamaki. It must have been so embarrassing for you, Mirio, you know, due to your quirk and all,” the blue haired girl inquired rapidly.The dark haired… elf-man? sunk further into his seat like he was trying to sink beneath the floor in a desperate attempt to escape any part of this situation. Though, the blond man met her with equal enthusiasm.“It was a bit awkward and weird,” he admitted a wide smile on his face, “but it was a good exam overall.”The girl nodded rapidly, taking in every bit of this new information, “What about you Tamaki?”The dark spiky haired man sunk lower in his seat (was that even possible?) and mumbled out, “I’d rather not talk about it, I’m just glad it was over.”Peter finally reached the teetering plastic foldout table, “Are you the check-in people? There was no sign, oh god, this is going to be so embarrassing if you say it’s not, and now I’ve talked too long, this is absolutely not how I wanted this day to go.”The periwinkle haired girl was quick to respond, “This is the check-in table, but we’re not actually the check-in people. We’re covering for our friends until they come back. We can sign you in and get you your card,” she switched to a fake pretentious tone, “their unexpected absence shall not hinder the glorious check-in process.”Peter chuckled, the tension in his shoulders releasing.The blond man talked next, “What’s your name?”“Peter Parker.”The girl’s eyes brightened at that, “Are you from America?”“Yeah.”“That’s so cool! What’s it like there? Your Japanese is so good! How did you learn? Was it hard? Why did you come all the way here? Was the flight terrible? Or oooo did you take a boat? You probably didn’t take a boat, but it’d be so cool if you did.”The blond man chuckled, “You don’t have to answer any of that, and coming to U.A. was a smart choice, it’s the best hero school in the world.”Peter responded with a shaky smile, “I heard that, that’s why I’m here.”Mirio handed him his card with a bright smile.“Good luck on the entrance exam, I sure you’ll do great!” Mirio said.“Yeah! Go kick some robot butt!” The girl shouted pumping her fist in the air.“Thanks!” Peter shouted while jogging off to enter the building, his nerves settled and a smile brighting his face.“I hope he does well, he was really nice,” Nejire said.“He will,” Mirio declared. “He’s going to make it.”Nejire didn’t question Mirio.She looked forward to seeing Peter Parker in the future.“Wait… did you just spoil the exam?”“Aw nuts.” Peter entered an almost empty auditorium, there was only one other person. A dark blue haired man who shot to his feet the moment he caught sight of him, his back abnormally straight.“I am Iida Tenya, from Somei Academy, I see you also arrived early, it is always important to be ten minutes early to every event. I’m glad someone else shares that sentiment.”“Yeah, my Aunt May helped out with basically any event we went to, so it’s just habit to arrive early for me.”“Your aunt seems like an excellent person.”She was, he thought solemnly.“Are you prepared to live up to the expectations of being a U.A. student, should you pass? It is important that all students that will attend are well equipped to uphold this prestigious school’s high reputation,” his hand chopped violently through the air.“Uhhhh…” Peter said intelligently.“Hello, there listeners,” a voice boomed from the stage.Peter didn’t think he’d ever get used to how ridiculous some people looked here, not that the man didn’t pull off looking like a cockatoo, but there’s only so much confidence does to an overall outfit.
