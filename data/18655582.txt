 To say that he has memory problems would be stating the obvious, but people seem to have several misconceptions about what that means. The first, and most grating on his patience, has been the insistence that he is Bucky Barnes.Which he is, technically.Just not the Bucky Barnes Steve wants him to be.They may have the same face, the same set of skills, the same voice, and sometimes when he doesn’t dream about hands wet and sticky with blood, he thinks he remembers who Bucky is: One of three kids, the middle one, and the only boy; how his shoulders would hold Rebecca up; how his arms would squeeze Tallulah in a hug when he had nightmares; how his cheek would be kissed by his ma whenever she saw him between one job and another. He’d been the man of the house from age seven ever since his Pop kicked it; he’d been Stevie Rogers’ best friend after a playground brawl; he’d been the sole survivor of Hydra’s first experimentation into the Super Soldier Serum, and he’d been the only casualty in the Howling Commandos.He likes girls, Steve insists.He never finished school, didn’t care for it. He preferred the factories. He enlisted because he was brave, and it was the right thing to do.Everyone thought he’d died.The last is about the only thing Steve has right.He was good at math, he liked science; he only took the girls out dancing for an excuse to see the Stark Expo after. He hated the factories, but he hated how haggard his ma looked even more. And he didn’t enlist, he’d gotten a letter and been told to go, and then he did…Not that he’d ever tell Steve, not that Steve would even believe him, he thinks with a snort.Despite escaping Hydra and eking out a life for himself in Bucharest for several months all while hiding from them both, his problematic memory seems reason enough to dismiss any opinion that ‘Bucky’ wouldn’t have had.And that’s why it grates – why it tries on his patience because otherwise, being Bucky Barnes is easy; being Bucky, with his confident swagger and Brooklyn twang is far better than being the Winter Soldier.“I don’t know, Frosty, I’m kind of a fan of the murder strut,” Tony leers. “And I’ve always liked my compliments with a touch of fatalism.”He snickers, exaggerating the Russian roll of his words, “You’ve got problems, kitten.”“Only with my pants," Tony smirks, wiggling his brows, "wanna help fix that?"Because Bucky gets to be more than a weapon, he gets to have the life he didn’t have all those years ago – stolen by poverty and a war he wanted no part in – all on the dime of one of the many men whose life he’d had a hand in ruining.And that’s the second thing – a misconception that has him biting his tongue so often than he tastes blood far more than he ever did with Hydra – because no matter how much Steve insists that Tony owes you, the truth is that he doesn’t. He likes to think he knows himself better than Steve, and he can say, confidently, whether he’d been the Bucky Barnes from the Forties or just the Bucky Barnes that exists right now, he knows Tony Stark doesn’t owe him anything. Which is another matter altogether trying to explain that to Tony.Unlike Steve, Tony didn’t walk on eggshells with Bucky’s presence, actually, it was closer to tearing out the floor with a sledgehammer:“I blew your arm off, I give you a new one," Tony had stubbornly declared.“That’s not -”“An eye for an eye,” Tony says with a sardonic flourish, “or in this case, an arm for an arm.”“I killed your parents,” he protests.“I almost killed you.”Bucky scowls, “Almost being the operative word.”“Would have, is a better one,” Tony retorts, and that’s – fair – if anyone thought a pair of Super Soldiers stood a real chance against a veritable walking, flying, arsenal in a suit of the most advanced technological marvel, they were idiots. “What you do – under Hydra or not – that’s your path and your responsibility to deal with. What I do – and how I make up for it – is mine. Do you want this arm or not?”And for the first time, Bucky realized – he could say no.Because the third misconception about his faulty memory is about others making choices for him – like he doesn’t remember how to make them for himself – like he can’t be trusted to. And Tony’s apparently not a fan of that kind of micromanaging.Bucky looks at the empty shoulder mooring, and the Hydra arm sitting in an open box on the workbench, and thinks of the Hydra operatives still remaining – still hiding, and says, “Yes…yes, please.”And Tony smirks like he knows what Bucky had been thinking, and says, “Then, let’s get to work.”“Whoa, wait a second, Tones,” Rhodes interjects. His relationship with Tony is completely different to the one with Bucky and Steve because unlike Steve, Rhodes knows his best friend – and he knows that twinkle in his eye can only mean trouble. “Do you know how much noise this’ll make?”The Hydra arm came with conditions: take it, and return to service. It’s another letter demanding his life, a draft in the form of his only way
