Chapter 1: Preview/Guidelines
    




Chapter Text
Just quick guide on how this will workSend prompts via comment section here or you can message me on tumblr: Skiplo-wave ( this helps if you wish to remain anonymous ^-^)Must be ironstrange related but can totally be a fic of them breaking up, dating someone else, vice verse. Prompts can be anything, general to explicit just be specific like: Tony and Stephen kissing. Want that be wholesome smooch or spicy kiss lol Limits: I wont do historical au nor underage Au**I won't write like 45 yr old Stephen x 15 year old Tony. But if you want me write kid fic of them as kids being kids I can do that aka a general rated fic Hmm that's literally it lol. This is new for me basically it'll update when I get a prompt. So yeah send your prompts and I'll do nice one-shot for it  This'll be fun 💖P.S, although these are shorts fics just be patient. I will get to them. I plan to have one if not two fics per day 👌🏾
