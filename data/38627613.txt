Chapter 1: The bargain
    




Chapter Text
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away. There were two planets. Avalon and Akkaba. The leader of Avalon known as the high evolutionary meets in secret with the leader of Akkaba known to all as the black king. The evolutionary knows him best as Klaus Schmidt.  "Well well. Look at that. My presence is graced by the ruler of Avalon." Schmidt said. "What do you want Klaus?" Evolutionary said. "Ah, getting down to business. I do enjoy that most about you Hiram." Schmidt chuckles.  "Why am I here?" Hiram asks. "I have a bit of a problem." Schmidt. "There's a new legend going around that a telepath will bring destruction and all that."  "And you are telling me this because?" Hiram asks. "Well of course normally I would kill the little welp myself however you know me and my feelings towards mutants. So I came to propose an alternative. Your people would raise this potential hellraiser. My people raise one of your offspring. It could even be a human if you like." Schmidt said. "And WHY would I ever even agree to such things!?!" Hiram asks. "Do you really have in you to allow a child to die?" Schmidt asks with a smirk.  Hiram frowns at that. "What is this child's name?" "Charles. Charles Xavier." Schmidt said. "The boy's parents are more than willing to get rid of the little weakling. And this way all parties can be satisfied." Schmidt said. "Except for the baby you would receive!" Hiram said. "He will end up strong, not unlike your weakling citizens." Schmidt scoffs. "And I have the perfect human in mind. Say didn't one of your generals just have a boy on their own? What was his name, Eisenhardt?"  "You can't be serious!" Hiram said. "My boy for yours. I will allow you to the end of the week to make your decision." Schmidt said then he left him alone to collect his thoughts.  ****** When the week passed Hiram returned and was not alone. Much to the black king's surprise. "This is a surprise." "If this turned out to be a trick. I WILL kill you!" Hiram said with a hiss. "Oooo the high evolutionary threatening violence. Now that is something you don't see everyday." Schmidt said.  Hiram then hands the baby over to the black king. Much to his disgust. Soon the black king hands over Charles to Hiram.  "So tell me. What IS this child's name?" Schmidt asks. "Max. His name is Max." Hiram said.  "Max? Hmmm now that won't do at all. You need a better name suited for you. Since one day you shall rule. Yes yes I think I will call you….ERIK. Yes, that's it. You will be called Erik Magnus." Schmidt said.  "....Magnus?" Hiram asks. "What, you don't like it? Well you're not going to raise him now are you?" Schmidt asks with a smirk.  "You're a monster." Hiram said. "And soon. Erik will be one too." Schmidt said.
