Chapter 1: I Never Was Ready So I Watch You Go
    




Chapter Text
 Memories are a bittersweet thing, you don’t realize you’re making them until the moments are over and you’re looking at them under a frosted piece of glass. Smiling at the friends you once knew, laughing with a family that is either still with you or gone forever, wiping your tears at a lost loved one you’ll never see again. Memories are uneven pieces in a long jagged puzzle of a life, some broken along the way, faded with time, various colors and textures you can reach out and touch whenever you want. Skye has many memories trapped behind fogged glass, so many bloody and bruised pieces she can no longer fit together, they drift beside one another still clinging to the puzzle that makes up her heart, but they are exiled, abandoned, too painful to join the rest. Those are the death pieces, the midnight edged darkness that if she were to graze one with a fingernail it’d burn, steal her blood. She banishes those now, doesn’t think about them unless she’s in therapy or with her grief group in New York. Trauma once ruled Skye’s life, it robbed her of every sense, choked her with tears and blood until she was no longer a person, just a by-product of what Whitehall did to her when she was eighteen years old. The pain of those days, of what she did as a result of becoming Inhuman, no longer clings and bites these days. Neither does all the things she’s been through the past ten years, the wounds inflicted onto her skin are simply healed scars now, no longer preventing her from living the life she wants. Of all the pieces of her life, her family is the most important, the people who took her in when she was alone and broken, the husband who loves her unconditionally and without hesitation, life didn’t have to bless her with the Avengers or Grant Ward, but it did. She gazes at those particular pieces fondly, holds them close to her chest because they are oh so fragile. They are fragments now of what they used to be, years of loss and saving the world between them, but still good, still whole. Skye is thinking of Clint Barton, Steve Rogers, Thor and Vision as the morning sun washes across the blank walls of Stark Tower. A place she called home more often than not, her bedroom by the kitchen still the same way she left it years ago. Standing in the empty living room by the couch, Quake crosses her arms and stares and stares, at the bare kitchen that was once filled with bodies and laughter, this living room where the Avengers spent many nights on these couches talking and drinking, patching each other’s wounds. She looks up towards the roof that used to be a prison for her, but turned into something beautiful when she married the love of her life. So many memories, so much love in this ridiculously large building, this is the place where she broke down and built herself back up with the help of her family. This is where she found herself again, nursed her broken heart to whole, stitched up the bleeding pieces of her soul so many times. These walls held the family she found, the ones who saved her, who brought light into all the dark places that were carved into her chest. When Skye first moved in in her early twenties, she thought the Avengers, this home, would last forever. Never thought almost fifteen years later she’d be alone staring at the floors and countertops, wishing everyone she loved would come back. Wish she’d get to hear Clint’s laugh one more time, see Clint’s smile, or make fun of Vision when he drifted through the walls. Skye never thought she’d have to miss any of them, even with the threat of their deaths clinging to her, she never prepared to be standing here without them. Her fingers inch underneath that glass full of memories, over to the kitchen where Clint broke his ankle while sparring with Nat, in the hallway where she met Steve Rogers for the first time, or when Pepper walked in on her and Thor in her bedroom and Tony gagged in the sink. Upstairs on one of the top floors when she and Bruce were playing pool when Ultron, Tony’s mad creation, made his presence known. Right where she’s standing in the middle of these two couches, where she and Grant had many reunions after being separated yet again, her jumping into his arms and kissing his neck. So much life was lived here, so much love and happiness, so many fights and smiles, inside jokes and private laughter fills this space, now only echoes remain. Time has a funny way of healing, of making you move on even if you don’t want to, and while Skye will forever miss her life in Stark Tower, she’s accepted she’s a different person than the one who first walked in here, and that nothing ever stays the same. She’s no longer the girl shaking in Nat’s leather jacket, not the damaged walking disaster sleeping with Bucky Barnes and whoever else can turn her brain off for the night. Skye has learned to leash her demons, so she controls them and not the other way around, she’s not a mess
