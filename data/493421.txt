If there was one indisputable fact about Colonel Nicholas Fury, it would be that he was a sadistic son of a bitch when he had a mad on.Case in point: whenever it should happen that, in the course of fighting off evil, saving the world, and cleaning up the messes that SHIELD didn't want to dirty its hands with, the Avengers found themselves blamed for property damage, personal injury, or disturbing the goddamned peace, Colonel Fury liked to exact a particular little revenge for it.  He enjoyed separating the team for their debriefing sessions, having his under-agents interrogate them each in isolation and then letting them sweat (often literally, if he didn't give them the chance to shower after the battle,) until he'd decided he was satisfied with how their stories matched up.  Or, as Tony believed, until he was satisfied that his metaphorical dick was the biggest.  Nobody but Bruce got to go home until Fury's little Time Out in the Sky was over with, and Bruce got out of it mainly by brute intimidation and naked threats.  The rest of them had to wait.But for the really bad mission debriefs, like, say, those with ramifications involving elected officials, the press, and/or the World Security Counsel on his personal phone line, Fury liked to call the Avengers into the debriefing room in pairs and handle the inquisition sessions in person.  And when that happened, he always, always left Steve and Tony waiting till last, so they'd be good and wound up by the time he gave them their say.    See above, re; sadistic son of a bitch."We are so not taking the heat on this one," Tony muttered, making another circuit of the waiting room.  "This is on Fury.  Him and his crappy intel and last minute, half-assed interventions.  We could have had this if he'd just-""It's not Fury's fault."  Steve didn't turn, didn't break parade rest, didn't look away from the expanse of nothing outside the window.  "And yeah, we could have had it.  But we didn't."Yep, there it was; Captain America's fucking leaden, judgey, restrained, 'I am very disappointed' voice, right on schedule.  Because it didn't matter that Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor had all just spent the last four hours digging the star spangled asshole out from under that school.  And it didn't matter that Clint and Natasha captured the HYDRA cell's ringleader and cleared the gunmen away from the hostages before any of them got shot.  And it didn't even matter that only one -- one -- out of the six bombs in the basement actually went off.  (Well.  Technically two, but if Steve thought Tony was going to let Bruce take the heat for that one, he was fucking concussed.)  Oh no: apparently all that mattered to Cap was that they could have done better."Does Jarvis have a total number yet on the injured?""Less than fifty," Tony gritted as he marched up to Cap's rigid back, part of his brain taking careful note of where the uniform's Kevlar was torn, seams failed, armor crimped.  It was in pretty good shape for having survived a ground zero demolition charge plus a building collapse, but the asshole inside it was apparently determined to spoil the triumph.  "None of them critical, so you can quit with the guilt trip right fucking now, because none of them would have even got a scratch if Fury's report had-""Save it," Steve sighed like he still had the building sitting on his chest, but his spine stayed locked up straight, and his reflection's blue eyes stayed locked on the sky."Look," Tony told him in a perfectly reasonable tone of voice, "we had no way of knowing the gamma bomb was going to trigger off of my arc reactor.  We still don't know that's what actually happened.  Jarvis hasn't finished the analysis.  There could have been a trigger man-""We shouldn't have needed to know!"  Steve whirled away from the window, and then the damage showed -- a deep bloom of bruise along one cheek and jaw, two running gashes where flying debris had sliced through the cowl.  His hair was dark with blood along one temple, though the wound was long closed beneath the gore.  "I had you on evac duty, Tony!" Steve said through those perfect white teeth that sometimes made Tony want to find out what the serum would do about it if he knocked a couple out. "You were supposed to be getting the kids out of the school while-""While you had Bruce with you in the steam tunnels, trying to defuse a goddamned BOMB!  Doctor Bruce Banner; a physicist who has no goddamned electrical engineering experience whatsoever!"  Tony threw his arms wide, leaning hard into Steve's space and not giving a damn for the accusation in those blue eyes.  He was shouting now, and fucking glad to do it.  "I'm the one who should have-""You've got the best mobility of anyone on the team, Tony," Steve yelled back, not giving an inch, "You're the only one who can scan through walls for life signs, and find the kids who were hiding, or hurt, or un
