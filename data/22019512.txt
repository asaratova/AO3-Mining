Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
Tony Stark could be labeled a lot of things, but patient wasn't one of them. People had always had a habit of falling all over themselves to get any attention they could from him. It was extremely rare to have someone deny him their time and attention. While he had long accepted that lack of behavior from the other Avengers and Pepper, there was one person who he could not accept it from.Peter Parker.The boy had spent the last eight years avoiding him and anything to do with him. Spider-Man had even taken up avoiding any fights that involved The Avengers and if he did join, he left without a word once it was over. The spider themed hero had even turned down multiple offers to join the team, much to their disappointment. Of course, Tony would never admit he most likely was the cause behind his refusal. No, Peter Parker was making it very clear his involvement with any thing Tony Stark related was over completely.It was driving Tony insane. From the moment he had met the 15 year old, he knew he was something special. Tony had no doubt he could mold the boy into an amazing hero. Everything had started off so well, that was, until Peter's idol worship vanished under a collapsed building. Peter Parker no longer wanted Tony Stark as a mentor.The suit Tony had made him was returned as soon as the Vulture had been taken care of. Tony found it on his desk with a yellow post-it note explaining it, and anything else Tony could offer, wouldn't be needed or accepted again. At first Tony had assumed Peter had just been overwhelmed by what had happened and needed some time to deal with things, so he left him alone. A month went by before Tony decided Peter had had enough time and as he prepared to call the boy, a news flash caught him by surprise. A fire in an apartment building in Queens was being reported by the local news. As firefighters gathered and people crowded around the building there was a shout of surprise. Tony watched in shock as Spider-Man swung into the building, quickly flying back out with an infant in his arms. He lowered himself to the ground and handed off the baby to a sobbing, thankful mother. Tony was rooted to the spot as people notedly praised the return of their local hero. His new suit was similar in extent to the one Tony had given him, but it obviously wasn't Tony's suit. No, this suit had been created by someone else. Tony's heart clenched.Tony kept close watch on the hero for the following few months. His fighting skills had dramatically increased and so had his confidence. It occurred to Tony that Peter was most likely training with someone on the side. Whoever it was, they were very good.Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil. Spider-Man. The words were being connected more commonly than not as Tony kept a close eye on Peter's nightly movements. While none of The Avengers ever paid much attention to the vigilante from the area known as Hell's Kitchen, Tony suddenly found himself very invested. It was well known Daredevil stuck prominently to that part of town, it had Tony wondering how Spider-Man had become involved. He tried hard to ignore the grim thoughts that Peter had taken up with the man to get the training and mentorship he was no longer interested in from Tony. The thought was depressing. All his grand plans for the growth of both Peter and Spider-Man were quickly slipping through his fingers.Looking out over New York from his office in Avenger's Tower, Tony sighed as his call went straight to voicemail. It didn't matter how often Peter changed his phone number, he would keep trying. He knew he hadn't exactly done best by the kid, but damnit, he was trying to make amends! If Peter would just stop acting like a child and answer his calls, everything could be worked out and be fine. Peter would get the even more improved suit Tony had made and then accept The Avenger's offer. If Peter would only answer his phone! ~~ Peter Parker had not missed Tony Stark in the past eight years. It didn't help that the man was persistent in trying to talk to him. After Vulture had been taken care of, Peter had had a long talk with May and then returned Tony's suit. He had debated returning to being Spider-Man at all, but May had insisted he not let Tony keep him from what he felt was right. She had quoted his Uncle Ben's advice that with great power came great responsibility. While Peter took to creating technical elements for his new suit, May had worked diligently to help put it together. The two had many discussions about Peter's return to the streets before May finally asked if Peter knew anyone he could get some hero advice from. Knowing how much she worried, Peter set out to find someone he could confide in. His first stop was Reed Richards. The Fantastic Four were well known for their heroic efforts, but Spider-Man was considered a vigilante, and Reed had suggested he find someone that better fit that role. It was then he had been sent to find a man known as Da
