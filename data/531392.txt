There was a lock on the door of Tony's workshop for a reason. Not because he was afraid of internal espionage, no, Jarvis was more than enough to handle anyone actually stupid enough to try and physically break in for a little petty theft. And not because Tony was unfriendly, which he was, but that was a whole other set of issues to be dealt with on another day. No, there were locks on his door because Tony's workshop was like his own version of a playground, with all the best toys, and Tony did not play well with others. He needed to think in here, a lot, and it was damned hard to think properly when someone was hanging around, yammering into his ears about stockholders and meetings and everything else, and would you pay attention for two minutes, Tony?Yeah, the lock on the door was awesome or it used to be. Before Tony had invited a group of superheroes to move in and somehow, slowly but surely, everyone who lived here had gotten ahold of the code. Worse, everyone who got the code tended to use it and it didn't matter how often Tony changed it or how loudly he complained, somehow or another he always had someone hanging around. On any given day, Bruce might stop in to compare notes or Steve would stop in, asking for a spar or checking to see if Tony had remembered to eat that day. Clint would just appear out of nowhere and it didn't seem to matter how many cameras he had going or how many times Tony had reminded him that he actually did have a heart condition, there he would be again and Tony would have another year's worth of adrenaline dumped into his bloodstream. Natasha was less often and usually she had curt questions or requests for new gear that was interesting enough to distract Tony from his own projects and get started on a new one. Yep, on any given day someone was here annoying him and Tony would have given in and gotten an old school deadbolt if he hadn't slowly but surely discovered that he loved it. It wasn't so bad, really, having a group of superheroes hanging around, even if it was hell on the cleaning bills and his blood pressure.Today seemed like it was Thor's day to be annoying. He was wandering around the workshop as Tony worked, touching things that he wasn't supposed to with curiosity and Tony was happy to explain anything Thor asked about. Big guy was actually pretty smart when it came down to it and he caught on quickly.  It was hard not to like Thor. He was a lot like a big, shaggy dog, one that lit up with happy wagging when someone scratched his ears or sulked and pissed on the floor when he was annoyed. Not a comparison that Tony was going to share with a guy who biceps that were nearly the size of Tony's head but hey, that was fine. Tony had found out a long time ago that most of his thoughts should probably stay that way. Today, though, he got the idea that Thor wanted something. His restless wandering had the impression of someone trying to work up their nerve and that alone had Tony's curiosity perking like an old-style coffee maker. Thor was not usually a guy who had a problem making his needs known, as the grocery delivery service well knew. "Might as well spit it out, big guy," Tony said, finally, patience not really on his list of attributes. Besides, if Thor kept messing around with things he was either going to break something or someone and Tony suspected strongly that it wasn't going to be Thor who was the broken one.  "I have a request of you," Thor said without preamble, like he'd just been waiting for Tony to ask. He crossed big arms over his chest and leaned against a table and his eyes darted around, looking at anything but Tony.Okay, there was only one thing that got Thor this worked up. Tony sighed. "Thought your brother was behaving.""He is," Thor assured him hastily, "It is not any cause for concern amongst our allies.""Which is why you're talking to me and not calling a group meeting," Tony said, flipping his welding goggles back down. Might as well work while they talked. "So what do you need from me?""I am in need of a mediator," Thor said, his voice carrying over the hiss of the welding torch."A mediator?" Tony repeated, tasting the word. That was something no one had asked of him before. Consultant, yes, engineer, superhero, he'd gone all those routes. Mediator was definitely a new one."Yes. One who is not of Asgard, one who would be willing to help."Which most people of Asgard wouldn't, at least not where Loki was concerned. Most people of Earth wouldn't be lining up either, frankly, so Tony could see where Thor would have a short list. Stillâ€¦"Not that I don't appreciate the confidence, Road House," Tony said absently, making minute adjustments to the right hand repulsor. Last time they'd been in the field he'd been veering a little towards the left and little miscalculations were best fixed before they became big miscalculations that were likely to send him swerving into a building. "But I'm not exactly known for my soothing, rational nat
