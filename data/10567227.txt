1  The avengers had no idea why Tony had invited them all to stay in the tower. It had been odd to suddenly be invited after the battle of New York so none of them really accepted the offer. At least not right away anyways.While the others didn’t respond to his invitation Tony went back to his life of inventing and occasionally going to boring meetings for Stark Industries. It was after one of these meetings that he was walking to go get a coffee from a nearby café he loved. A sound attracted his attention and while he was a genius that knew not to check out every little thing he heard this was one of those times his genius could be questioned.In the alley he was passing he found within the trash a cat jumping down from it to take a rotting sandwich to its kittens nearby. He looked at the six kittens of black, white, and light brown fur. A single call to Happy had the driver arriving with fresh tuna and a carrier for the family.The mother cat was likely a former house cat as she didn’t scurry away from him and took a liking to him probably for stopping her from poisoning her kittens with rotten food.He took the family to the vet but the mother had no chip or a way to see who her former owner might have been.  At least the cats were healthy but he had made the mistake of spoiling them with tuna. Pepper was getting a laugh out of it as cats had domesticated the great Tony Stark and put him on a normal schedule. The cats would meow at him if he didn’t go to bed on time and they woke him when they wanted to eat which was at eight a.m. every morning. So like a zombie needing brains he’d do his half dead walk to the kitchen for coffee and set tuna out for the little bastards that he will deny until the day he dies he loves to death.  2  Several months after the fall of Shield Captain America AKA Steve Rogers was running off with his newest best buddy looking for his old best buddy. Tony had hear through the grapevine and somehow that made him a bit sad that the team he was supposed to be a part of never bothered to actually contact him. He sighed as he held his bag of baked goods that would help ease his lonely soul. A noise caught his attention and without hesitation he went to check it out. Another alley and somehow he got the feeling he’d end up with another stray. This stray just happened to have a different type of claws and wasn’t a cat.  Seeing an exhausted former Hydra assassin struggling to hold his own against a group of what was likely Hydra agents was pissing Tony off. He changed his watch to form into the portable iron man gauntlet and fired at the agents. When they fall swooped in and took one of their guns. Without hesitation he shot one of each of their legs and then called Coulson.  Yes he knew Coulson was alive, he was a paranoid bastard and was spying on Shield because he knew either Fury and Coulson were immortal or they had endless clones. Those two would never die and Tony was willing to bet half his fortune on it.While he waited for Coulson he ignored the Hydra agents curses and looked to Bucky Barnes.“Hey, so you look like shit and could use a safe place to rest. Want to hang out at my tower at least until you don’t look like you’re going to pass out? I have donuts.”Bucky just looked confused.“Why would you think I’d trust your tower is safe?”“Because I’m the dragon that guards it.”As though to further prove this point one of the agents attempting to get to their weapon that was taken from them was shot in the arm by Tony who was still looking at Bucky. The bullet met its target and Bucky had to wonder why Tony’s file said nothing about how dangerous he was.“So donuts and safety.” Bucky said giving the inventor all he needed to hear.The donuts were handed over and before Coulson could arrive Happy had the former assassin on his way to the tower that was protected by a dragon AKA Tony Stark. When Coulson and his team arrived the new director of Shield asked what happened and upon hearing they had targeted the former winter soldier Coulson saw the look in Tony’s eyes that said he would not like fighting the genius for the soldier. With the promise Bucky wouldn’t be a threat Tony returned to his tower to find the soldier hopping away from the cats that trailed after him seeking the sugary sweets.“Hey you little bastards no taking Bucky’s food.”Bucky apparently wasn’t expecting six kittens and mama cat to suddenly change the focus of interest to the genius they used as a climbing post. Bucky watched as he continued to eat the sweets and noticed Tony didn’t complain as the cats just stayed there hanging from him except the cat with black and white fur that stayed on his shoulders and swiped away all others who dared try to take it’s place.“So you like cats?”“No I just happened to pick up strays a lot. So introductions, I’m Tony and this is my horde of cats. The one on my shoulders trying to murder all the others trying to take his place is Smaug, the one who keeps trying to take his p
