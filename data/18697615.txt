Chapter 1





Chapter Text
A gentle knock on the door caused Peter to stir slightly in his bed. He was still half asleep when Steve quietly turned the knob and entered the room. He smiled when he saw the 17 year old still hovering somewhere in between sleep and consciousness. “Hey Pete, come on kiddo time to wake up.” Steve spoke gently. Peter lifted his head groggily. He had had a late night, stopping a midnight bank robbery. Peter cracked an eye open blearily.“Steve?” Peter said, voice slightly raspy. “Yeah kid,” Steve answered gently. “It’s 6:30 you gotta get up and get ready for school or you’ll be late.” Peter exhaled loudly. “Can’t Aunt Carol just fly me to school so I can sleep longer?”Steve snorted and shook his head at the kid. “I mean, you can ask but I don’t think that’ll go over well. C’mon Pete, I know it sucks but you really gotta get up.”Peter groaned and sat up slowly. Steve stood up from where he knelt by his bed and made to leave the room. When he reached the door he turned back to speak to Peter again. “By the way Bucky made pancakes so if you want any you better hurry up. You know how much Clint and Thor eat.”At this, Peter scrambled out of bed and rushed to get ready. It was common knowledge that Bucky was a fantastic cook, and his pancakes weren’t something you wanted to miss.-Ten minutes later Peter stumbled into the communal dining room, skidding as he ran. He was completely ready for school with his backpack slung haphazardly over one shoulder. He tossed the bag to the ground and slumped into the seat next to Tony. “Hey kiddo!” Tony smiled at him. “Did you sleep well?” Peter yawned in response. Tony snickered. “You’re lucky your aunt’s on a trip or she would skin both of us for you staying out so late last night.” “Yeah well they don’t call NYC the city that never sleeps for nothing” Peter responded slyly. This earned a chuckle from around the table, even though Steve looked slightly disapproving. Most of the avengers and co. were there despite the early hour. Friday mornings were the time that almost everyone was at the tower so that was the designated team breakfast. Tony and Steve sat at the opposite ends of the table. Pepper and Bucky sat on the right of their partners respectively. There weren’t any “assigned” seats but everyone had seemed to claim their own spots, sitting next to friends and lovers. “Oh I just remembered!” Peter exclaimed. “Aunt Carol do you wanna give me a ride to school today?” Carol looked up from where she had previously been conversing, aka flirting shamelessly with Brunhilde. She processed the request for a couple seconds before a wide smirk crept onto her face. “By ride do mean what I think you mean?” Peter nodded vigorously. “Sure kid. Why not, Val and I were planning on going out anyways.”Peter punched the air and whooped loudly. Pepper cleared her throat, clearly disapproving and worried. “Peter do you really think that’s a good idea?”Peter rolled his eyes smiling at his mother figure. “C'mon Pepper you’ve seen Carol body slam and entire spaceship and hold like over a ton I’m sure she can handle both me and ms. Brunhilde.” Pepper huffed out a short breath, Peter had a good point. “Fine.” She said before turning to point at Carol. “If you drop him I swear to god I’ll kill you.”Carol laughed softly. “Don’t worry Pepper! I got him!”-Thirty minutes later Peter, Carol, Brunhilde, Tony, and Pepper stood on the balcony that Tony usually used at a landing pad for the Iron Man armor. Peter turned to kiss Pepper on the cheek and hug Tony in turn. Tony smiled down at Peter and ruffled his hair. “Alright get going kiddo you’re gonna be late.” Peter gave the two one last smile before turning and jogging over to where the two women were waiting for him, arm in arm. “Alright Parker,” Carol said. “Let’s figure out how to do this. “Hmm.. Hey! Get up on my shoulders!”“What?” Peter asked incredulously.Carol knelt down to the ground and motioned for Peter to climb up on her shoulders. He did so hesitantly and startled slightly when Carol then stood up like he weighed nothing.  She bent slightly to pick up Brunhilde bridal style before taking off. Peter felt his stomach flip. This wasn’t the first time he had flown with carol, but it always gave him a thrill. He tightened his grip around the woman’s sides with his legs, knowing that his spider powers would make it nearly impossible to fall off if he didn’t want to.The ride lasted all of two minutes seeing as Carol was literally flying them across New York. Peter watched the buildings and suburbs of Manhattan and Queens pass below before Carol started her decent. She landed them a block away from Midtown, and let him off. As she stood back up, Valkyrie gave him a cheeky wink and salute before they took off again, becoming a blur in the sky like a shooting star.-For once, Peter was already seated when the tardy bell for first period rang. AP physics was first and he was excited. Mr. Daniels had told the class yesterday tha
