Work Text:
The soldier waits, but his handlers never come.He circles the rooftop checkpoint, scanning the ground ten stories below, scanning the air, scanning other buildings. People talk on their phones. They sip their coffees. They laugh. He’s wet, and he wants to get out of his clothes. His arm creaks and grinds. He thinks the hollow lick in his belly is hunger, but he has a report to deliver. He has a punishment to endure. They will come. He doesn’t know what to do if they don’t.

Pinned like—
What things are pinned?

(Insects and prey and butterflies too beautiful to live.)

Pinned like vermin and spinning, spinning. The Mission staggers above him, clutching his wounds — unacceptable. He should be dead by now, too much blood on the outside where it never should be, where the soldier made sure it would out. The Mission lists, but he is still standing, and he is still looking down at the soldier as if he sees salvation instead of death. 

The Mission lurches toward him, sapped of grace and heavy, but he gets to his knees anyway and he is wrenching the beam off of the soldier, his face twisted and damp, cheekbones stained red even as the rest of him goes pale. The soldier snarls as the space he’s lodged in widens enough for him to start wriggling. The Mission’s eyes are squeezed shut from the strain, and he growls with the exertion. Something low down down in the soldier’s gut sparks to life. But I knew him

The Mission frees him with an almighty bellow and reels backward, panting.

The soldier is going to kill him, and his masters are going to thank him for it.

The soldier thinks he must have had a mother once. He sits outside a cafe nursing a tap water while mothers bustle around ignoring him, dragging children along by the hand, or pushing them in strollers, or hauling them strapped to their chests like floppy soft bombs. It makes sense the way all causes and effects make sense: the soldier, who is a living thing to go by the beat in his heart, must have emerged from a person. He must have squalled and raged to be in the world, and he must have been taken away for the good of it. He thinks this as he watches each mother who passes him by. He assesses the risks they pose. What they would do to him if he were a threat to their young. They would be formidable, he thinks. Not emotion: evolution. The primal logic of propagation. These mothers, they could damage his systems if they had to, even though he is bigger and stronger and never, ever loses.Except the once.

You’re my friend, the Mission says. I’m not gonna fight you.
He drops his shield. He stumbles. He is bleeding but not enough, not how he should be. Not in the manner in which the soldier was meant to make him bleed. He pitches backward off this sinking ship and the soldier—

There is a burn in his eyes. There is something inside him that hurts, but when he does a systems analysis, there is no accounting for it. He has his orders. He could call them complete right now. He could go back to his handlers without the shame of failure marking him to be punished. 

But there are other orders. There is something unnamable, something big and hot and harsh the soldier cannot ignore, and it howls inside him until he dives along after the Mission.

Only when he drags the Mission to shore does the slashing of his innards cease. Only when he pinches the Mission’s nose shut and breathes air into waterlogged lungs does a wash of cool soothe him. Only when he sees the Mission cough with proof of life does the soldier straighten and walk away.

The soldier does not question orders. That is not his place.

Weeks pass and no one comes for him.He begins to remember things, like Thou Shalt Not Steal, but he does it anyway (food), he does it anyway (clothes), he does it anyway (money). He thinks there is a protocol for accepting punishment when he does something he is meant not to do—
Bless me Mary full of Grace who art in Heaven for I have sinned, the fruit of thy womb deliver us from evil, the Lord is with thee and the pains of hell
—but whatever those commands are, they hover like fog at the edges of his consciousness, and he cannot grasp at them.

He goes to the Smithsonian and learns he has a name.
—
He goes to a public library and learns he has a living sister.

He goes to where the Mission is staying with his mayfly friend because he knows he should follow orders. He knows he should complete orders. Order is righteous, orders are right, he has his orders and they areincomplete The Mission is recovering well, but he is enhanced and thus his rate of healing is not surprising. And yet the soldier is surprised. He should be able to hear the bones in the Mission’s wrists grind together when he grasps them, he should be able to span the Mission’s waist with the circle of his hands, he should feel fear tighten in his gullet at the way a moist, hacking cough bounces between cracker box walls, he should he should he should—Stay out of sight.
