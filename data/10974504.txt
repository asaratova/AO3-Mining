Work Text:
You tried so hard to conjure up some courage but nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just a look from him turns you into a puddle on the floor. What would you even talk about? You were just the secretary for Tony. You never had to do anything related to the Avengers. Just paperwork for his company and the supplies fos SHIELD and other things. He probably doesn’t even know you.Walking into the gym, you set your stuff down near the ellipticals hoping to get your sexual frustration out. You knew he wouldn’t be at the gym right now, so you let your guard down.Putting some music on, you started your 3 mile run. The music was blasting in your ears and you didn’t hear the gym door open.Bucky walked in, knowing that not many people come around this time of the day to work out. He still felt uncomfortable around the agents. He heard someone at the end of the gym working out and was about to leave.But then he saw you and stopped. Did anyone look this good running? You tight shorts and the neon pink sports bra that didn’t do its job very well made him mouth water.Damn you looked hot. And your body glistening in the light made his mind wander to how sweaty it would be under other circumstances.No stop. She probably thinks you’re weird. You never talk to her even when she whispers good morning.Walking to the other end of the gym, he went to the pull up bar that was facing your way, just to get a show while working out.You finished the run and went straight to the abdominal bench. You still didn’t know he was there. By that time, Bucky has moved on to the rowing machine.The second you started, he stopped. A perfect view of your ass made him almost break the machine. He suddenly let go, making a loud crashing sound which got your attention.You stopped and looked up, horrified by who was in the room with you.Shit.You finished another set quickly, and grabbed your stuff, nodding towards him and literally sprinting to the showers.“Great! You scared her you idiot.” Bucky muttered to himself and walked to the showers, wanting to apologize before you leave.You were so freaked out, you stripped in seconds and turned on the shower. Not thinking he would follow you, because why would he, you relaxed under the hot water, relishing the feeling on your shoulders.Completely forgetting where you were, you started singing the last song you heard on your playlist.

Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure
'Cause nothing can measure
Bucky walked in and was about to look for you when he heard your voice coming from behind a curtain.

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me
Did he just hear you sayi-

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me
Bucky stood in the middle of the room, speechless. What? You were the shy secretary that barely spoke to anyone!


S, S, S and M, M, M
S, S, S and M, M, M


Oh I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah,
I like it, like it
You finished and put a towel around you, walking out. Bucky didn’t have time to hide or walk out. You turned around and dropped what you were holding. He didn’t just hear you. Did he?Your breathing picked up and he sensed your unease.Well...it’s now or never.Taking a step closer, he saw you back up. So he stepped closer to you again until your back hit the wall of the stall.You didn’t know what you were feeling. Embarrassed? Scared? Turned on? Definitely turned on. Way more than you should be to be honest.“Hmmmm. It is true that the quiet ones are always the dangerous ones.” He smiled and stepped in your space.You weren’t able to say anything.“What’s wrong doll? Cat got your tongue?” He placed his arms on the wall behind you, completely blocking your escape route.Lowering his head down to your neck, he stopped when he felt your breath.“If you want me to stop, all you have to do is say it.”Your legs were shaking now.“Doll? I need to hear you say you want this.” You were looking down, not able to look him in the eyes. Holding your chin, he raised it.“You want this?”You didn’t trust your vocal chords so you just nodded. The second you gave him permission, he attacked you lips, grabbing your hips and pulling you to him. You moaned at how aggressive he was, loving how hard he was around you.You put your arms around his neck, forgetting that you were holding a towel. You felt it slip and were about to grab it when he held both your hands above your head with his metal one. You were squirming and pulling but he didn’t budge.“Hmmm shit honey you are gorgeous.” He immediately grabbed your boobs, pulling on one nipple and biting the other.“Omygah fuck Sergeant Barnes-
