Prologue

---By twenty-first century, it was generally being taught in all grade school health classes that most Omegas had two heat cycles per year. Contrary to popular portrayal in early movies and television shows (almost all of which were written and produced by Alphas), Omegas did not keel over if they did not have an Alpha to help them through their heats. It made the heat an easier time, certainly, and it could be incredibly pleasurable if both Alpha and Omega were enthusiastic and consenting participants, but it wasn’t strictly necessary. Most Omegas made out just fine, if not a little itchy and hot.  Likewise, Alphas did not enter a rut from simply being around any Omega in heat, even if it was their bonded partner. In fact, the vast majority of Alphas would never enter a rut in their entire lives. And, according to mating and health scientists, all of this is held to be true—provided, of course, that the Alpha and Omega in question were not Compatible.---
