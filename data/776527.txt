Thor's position in this whole... thing, well it's almost understandable. He's hundreds (thousands?) of years older than the rest of them, and up until his little brother figured out that he was adopted and had that little psychotic break, his family was pretty tight knit. Steve, though, was raised half in an orphanage, half by a single mother who didn’t have time to spoil him but did have time to teach him self-sufficiency and love. And he’s older too, yes, but his own memories of family are dim childhood blurs, under a whole lot of not-family (or, the family he made for himself, like Bucky, especially Bucky, always Bucky). Somehow he'd come out without scars, though, without big walking wounds like the rest of his human teammates. He's been sad, he's been hurt, but even as a little shrimp in Brooklyn he was able to bounce back from it, just keep on ticking. When Bruce isn't-- well, when he isn't playing this game they all play-- he says that this is why the serum worked so well on him, and Steve denies and tries to explain to Bruce that he's not any better, that he knows how strong and good and noble Bruce is, and those conversations never work out. Today, though, they’re playing the game and conversation with Bruce will be a little limited; they definitely won’t be hitting any hard topics. He’s been waiting all day to get back to this; he’s been tied up with SHIELD for hours trying to resolve a dispute about whether the Avengers have or have not violated Latverian sovereignty, and Steve maintains that Latverian sovereignty probably stops where the robot attacks on Queens start. He’s late, and he just wants to get home to his family. When he finally gets inside the Avengers tower, his heart’s pounding just a little faster like it always does on game days. He addresses the empty air.  "Jarvis? Where are the kids?" "Master Clint and his guest are in the living room watching cartoons," Jarvis says, reasonably, and Steve flushes just a little even though he knows that a computer program can't judge. Or at least wouldn't judge, since it's been so good for Tony. "Young masters Tony and Bruce are in the main laboratory. Mrs. Rogers is in the kitchen with young Miss Natasha." "Great. Could you, uh, send a message to those areas?" "Channel opened, sir." "Hey, kids. Hey, doll, I'm home," he says, and his heart rate calms down and his chest opens up, and he feels that... that odd feeling, that other self coming down around him, fitting him snug and sure. Captain Rogers, Family Man and Devoted Husband. Suddenly he’s not blushing anymore, suddenly he’s smiling and his shoulders are rolling back confidently. Bruce's voice crackles back across the communications line. "Daddy!" There's a grunt in the background that he recognizes as Tony's distracted greeting. "Hey, dad!" Clint's voice chimes in, followed quickly by an incredibly shy "Hi, Captain Rogers." "Hi, Phil." That answers who Clint’s guest is, not that he had much doubt. "He's sleeping over," Clint says defiantly, and Steve smiles softly at the elevator wall. "Of course, Clint. I'll be up in a second." No response from Thor, and Natasha doesn’t talk. The elevator whisks him up to the main common room, and he can hear a high-pitched voice from the television straight through the insulated door. He comes out of the elevator with his hands on his hips, and Clint already looks sheepish and is fumbling for the remote. He's mid-late-teens today, hair spiked up, wearing a t-shirt over another long-sleeved shirt. Phil is roughly the same age, gangly gawky thing that he is, is wearing jeans with holes worn straight through the knees, and a shirt with Darth Vader on the front. "Clint, what have I told you about the volume?" Clint mumbles something, which, prompted by Steve's cleared throat, he repeats at higher volume: "Under thirty." "And I wish you'd watch something a little less grim," Steve sighs. "Dad," Clint rolls his eyes despairingly, confronted with an Adult who Fails to Get It.  "Invader Zim is awesome and deep. It has social commentary. And stuff." "There are some really strong messages about consumerism?" Phil offers in a quick mumble, and the tips of his ears go red. "Another half an hour, boys. And then homework. I know you have homework." "Ughhhhh," Clint moans. "It's history. I hate history." "It's okay, I'll help," Phil says, and gives him an adoring look that promises help with a lot of subjects that Steve doesn't particularly want to associate with his eldest son. Clint brightens immediately, and Steve sighs. He was a teenager, too, he remembers. He just doesn't have to know all about it, thanks. “Hey, Phil-- Nick knows you’re over here, right? You’re not going to get in trouble?” “Uh-huh,” Phil says almost sub-audibly, but he nods fervently to make up for his complete lack of ability to talk to Steve coherently. "Okay, boys. Remember, half an hour. And if you have trouble you know you can ask me anything, Clint. I'll check in before dinner to m
