Chapter 1





Chapter Text
I grew up the daughter of a self proclaimed genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. The only problem is that no one besides my father, his best friend and his AI knew we were related. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate being able to leave my house without the paparazzi following me around every second of everyday but I was really lonely. It also left me without a lot of guidance when both of my soul marks appeared out of the blue on my thirteenth birthday. To make matters worse both of my Soulmates are thought to be dead.This is the story of how I met, lost, found them again, and then had to choose between them and my father. This is the story of Nora Eliana Stark the unknown child of Tony Stark.
