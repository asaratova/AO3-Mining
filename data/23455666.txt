Chapter 1: My Opinion on Spiderman
    




Chapter Text
It was midnight on a Sunday, and in one particular room in Stark Tower, there was a twin-sized bed,in front of a wall full of Star Wars posters, and a computer monitor running, illuminating the rest of the room. The monitor showed videos of a vigilante in a red and blue suit swinging from tower to tower, saving people and stopping bad guys. Unfortunately, there was nobody there to view the video, as the room was empty.And the person who occupied that room was also the person on the monitor.The teen had only lived there for a few months, amongst the Avengers, who wanted nothing more than to uncover the vigilante’s identity. He was being fostered by Tony Stark himself, along with his wife, Pepper Potts. Though Pepper was kind to the young boy, Tony didn’t really pay much attention to him, which really did upset the teen. Some of the other Avengers were cool though. Steve was kind to him, even if he acted like he wasn’t there most of the time. Natasha was probably more anti-social than uncaring. Clint, Sam and Bucky all talked to him, which was cool, and Bruce was more like a weird uncle. Though, the boy kept telling himself he didn’t mind. He had people to talk to and most importantly, the fact that they ignored him made his secret identity easier to conceal. He never met Thor.  Yet, he couldn’t help but long for the connection, as long as it didn’t come at the cost of his secret identity. So, the computer monitor kept running, as the room remained unoccupied. Soon enough, the window on the far side of the room opened, and in came Peter Parker, the boy who could also be known as Spider-Man. Peter crawled on the ceiling, looking around the room, as he held his breath, hoping he would find nobody there. He let out a breath when he realized nobody else was in the room. He inhaled in and out, feeling the aching pains all over his body. Why was this job so hard? Why couldn’t someone else do it? He looked over at his computer monitor and felt a jolt of panic overcome him as he screamed, “SHIT.”Peter immediately covered his mouth, as he heard footsteps next door, I forgot I had neighbors. As the footsteps got closer and closer, he ripped off his homemade Spider-Man outfit and kicked it under the beat, as his heart beat faster and faster, as the footsteps inched closer and closer. He quickly shut off the laptop and got back in bed. Soon enough, his bedroom door slammed open, revealing a disgruntled Bucky Barnes, who looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than out of bed.“Kid, are you alright, I heard screaming?” He asked.“Yeah, I just, erm, fell out of bed…” Peter responded, hoping his excuse was believable.Based on the look on Bucky’s face it wasn’t.“I didn’t hear a thump.”Dammit.“You must be deaf then.” Peter said.
Damn, I must still be in sass-mode from Spider-Man. 
 Bucky didn’t seem mad, but instead, rolled his eyes, “Just go back to sleep.”“Yes, Mr. Bucky, sir.”***As Peter Parker’s alarm clock started beeping, he couldn’t help but let out a disgruntled sigh. Peter hated Mondays. He got up, as every inch of his body was telling him to lay back down, but he forced himself out of bed and into clothes. He left his room, and went to the kitchen, where he was sure to be ignored. But he had something he needed Tony to sign, and he felt nervous as he ran down to the dining room areaWhen he got there, everyone was already awake and eating breakfast, which Mrs. Potts was cooking. The first person to notice Peter’s presence was Tony.“Hey, kid.” Tony greeted, followed by a chorus of “hey Peters.”“Good morning, Mr. Stark.” Peter said.“It’s Tony, kid.” “Okay, Mr. Tony,” He greeted as he handed the man an orange permission slip, “can you sign this please?”Tony raised an eyebrow at his foster son, “What is it.”“It’s a permission slip, to DC for the Academic Decathlon.” Peter explained.Tony grunted, as he ran his pen on the signature line. Peter watched as he did so, feeling his stomach getting lighter in preparation for the next question. Come on, Parker. Just spit it out.“Um, I was wondering if you were, maybe able to make it?” Peter asked.Tony sighed, “I would, Peter, but I’m busy that weekend with a charity event.”
Of course, the charity event he doesn’t even go to.
But Peter feigned his disappointment, and instead smiled, “It’s okay, I understand.”“Good.”The room was silent amongst the Avengers for a moment, the only sound heard being the sound of them chewing their food. Peter sat awkwardly, as he saw Natasha staring into him for some reason. Peter tried to eat his food despite this uncomfortable detail.Luckily, Steve broke the silence. Unfortunately, it was something he didn’t want being talked about with him here.“Did you guys hear about the Spider-Guy last night?”Dammit.“No, I just woke up, Cap.” Tony retorted.Steve rolled his eyes, and continued, “Well he was out last night, and he saved two women  from being shot.” Tony nodded as he sipped his coffee, “It do
