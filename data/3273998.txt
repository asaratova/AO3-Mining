In retrospect, it made sense that everyone in the Tower thought that Darcy and Bucky had already met. They had been living in the same building for four months, they had all the same friends, they attended the same movie nights. Honestly, it wasn’t brain surgery. Of course the two of them had met. Right?Wrong. oOoDarcy was in Arizona when Steve brought Bucky into the Avengers. Her uncle had passed way and she went home for the funeral. Then her sister graduated high school, her mom got the flu, one thing led to another, and pretty soon, Darcy’s quick visit home turned into three and a half weeks. Ergo, when everyone was introduced to Steve’s best friend, Darcy wasn’t around. When Darcy came back to New York, the team was operating out of Tony’s California home for a few weeks. With the addition of Bucky and Sam, they all agreed that they needed some field practice as a team before a real crisis put civilian lives at stake. Remote spaces in which to unleash the Hulk were easier to come by in places like Nevada and Arizona, and it was easier to reach those from California. So Bucky wasn’t around for Darcy’s first few weeks back. Two days after the Avengers transplanted themselves from the west coast back to the east, Jane headed back to Tromso to follow up on what had turned out to be her very fruitful visit from the year before. Darcy, of course, went to help her. Now perhaps it could be expected that in those two days Darcy and Bucky would have met. Except that Bucky wasn’t the most social person in the Tower, more prone to hiding in his apartment, and Darcy was preparing her crazy scientist for a two-week trip abroad. Again, no meeting. When Darcy and Jane finally got back and everyone was actually in the Tower, together, for more than a few days, it was decided to have a movie night. Steve still hadn’t seen Star Wars (the original, as Tony insisted that he wouldn’t sully Captain America’s purity with the prequel trilogy), and it was universally agreed to be a great bonding night film. This was naturally the perfect time for Bucky and Darcy to meet. Except they didn’t. Overall, Bucky was doing much better than anyone had expected. The biggest aids to his recovery were Steve, who refused to give up on his friend, and Professor Xavier, who helped Bucky unlock parts of himself that were just hidden and not truly erased. There were still bad days, though. And that night was one of them. Not wanting to make Steve uncomfortable, no one mentioned Bucky’s absence as the former Winter Soldier took a breather up in the apartment he shared with Steve. Bucky assured his best friend that he needed some time alone and to go hang out with their teammates. Steve did so, albeit reluctantly, and had a great time despite his initial reluctance. Darcy was one of his favorite people in this new century, outgoing, always willing to catch him up on popular culture without making him feel stupid, curvaceous – and the two of them had a great time reconnecting while hanging out with Darth Vader, Iron Man and the rest of the team. Weeks passed. Darcy worked with Jane on the laboratory floors that Bucky avoided like the plague. Bucky spent copious amounts of time in the gym, which Darcy insisted was a foreign country to which she did not have a visa. There were a couple of team dinners during that time, one of which Darcy didn’t attend because an old college roommate was in town and they went out to dinner together, the other one missed by Bucky because he was upstate visiting Xavier’s School for the Gifted. So, no, at no point did the two individuals in question meet. Which came as a great surprise to pretty much everyone except for Bucky and Darcy when later events unfolded. oOo“So Natasha, you had to have absolutely loved the fact that Clint printed your title on your collarbone,” noted Darcy with a smile. The Black Widow in question shot Darcy a look, to which Darcy just beamed back at her. It wasn’t that Darcy wasn’t as wary as everyone else was when it came to Natasha, it’s just that Darcy figured someone needed to treat the woman like a normal person. Natasha hadn’t caused her bodily harm yet, so Darcy figured Clint’s soulmate was okay with it. Clint smirked. “Oh, yeah, about as much as I loved her branding me an assassin.” Given that Natasha’s soulmark was “Seriously? The Black Widow?” and Clint’s asked “So, Legolas? Are you going to kill me or what?”, these were reasonable statements to make. The discussion topic that night was soulmarks, obviously. While Natasha was a relatively private person, her soulmark was printed on her chest. She used cover-up when in public, but in the tower it was pretty hard to miss. Clint’s was masked most of the time he was out and about because it was in just the right place for his arm guard to cover it. He rarely wore long sleeves at home, though, where it was there for all to see. “My nickname was Legolas years before Orlando Bloom made the guy popular,” Clint elaborated. “I spent
