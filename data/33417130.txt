Chapter Text
All Might/Toshinori Yagi being DadMight = Miraculous Healing [Emitter]; Izu has astounding regenerative and healing abilities, able to regenerate lost limbs or organs. Downside, it does drain her if she's healing someone else, and will have Phantom pains of not having the limb or organ for a few hours or several days to a month at most.-Story: At the young age of 6, Izu experienced grief and despair. Her mother had protected her from criminals who broke into their home; what were they after? Izu herself. Something about repaying Hisashi's debt to them (who had left not that long ago), Izu didn't know or want to know as she packed her things as quietly as she could; her favorite things, clothes, and essentials, before jumping out the window and making her way down to the ground. Looking back only briefly to notice her mother on the floor inside unmoving, with loud explosions soon following. Izu ran as fast as she could before taking refuge in an alleyway, finally able to grieve her loving mother. She also later developed fear and PTSD because of the explosions. Time passed by for a few months and it was getting to the colder seasons, and Izu didn't know what to do, until she had the unfortunate luck of running into the people that killed her mom. Izu bolted once again, weaving through alleyways before accidentally bumping into someone's leg. She didn't bother looking up to see who she ran into, she quickly sputtered out an apology before bolting again down the street. Little did she know, she had bumped into All Might, her favorite hero. She continued to run for a few more blocks before taking a sharp turn down an alley to take refuge. It was so cold she could see her own breath, she tightened her hold on her hooded Hawks jacket, the only jacket she had grabbed, bringing it closer to her body, hoping to keep the heat in. She didn't realize she was nodding off before a muffled voice spoke to her, though she was feeling so cold her lips turning blue she barely acknowledged the person, slowly looking up to see a blurry person kneel down next to her, but she'd recognize that signature hairstyle anywhere. Muttering out his name before falling unconscious. Nighteye wasn't sure about All Might bringing a child into Might Tower, but clear evidence of her having been attacked made him reserve further judgment.-Izu Characteristics: Izu has 2C viridian hair that looks black in certain amounts of light or sways a certain way, bright emerald green eyes, and light freckled skin.-Love Interest: Mirio Togata; They'd meet when Mirai takes Mirio on for his internship. They'd discuss training ideas and they'd spar.-Extra: Due to her Quirk, Izu needs a ton of stamina, so she has a training regimen that always pushes her to her limits. It's after Izu heals All Might that they find out the drawback to her quirk. And since she's perceived to be a Healer, she trains in multiple martial arts to help fight (think of Tsunade's view on what being a Healer is).




Notes:

For those of you wondering after reading these; in most of these ideas, Mitsuo would go to Shiketsu High or Ketsubetsu, not UA. Love interests are optional, but there is a severe lack of Izu and Mirio stories.In terms of alternate names for Izu besides Izumi or Izuku;Isaki = One, BloomIyo = ProgressIzumiko = Fountain, ChildItoka = String, FlowerIne = Emphasis, Beauty Isane = Depending, Aspire Inoha = HeartIkuko = Help Someone, ChildIchime = Excellent, FriendItsuku = Sound, MoonItsuki = One, Radiance Isayo = Achievement, Generation Izusa = Fountain, BloomIkka = One, FlowerIkoma = Depending, the name of the ritual, TrueIkoi = Calm/Peace/Harmony/Concord/Serenity, ComeIsomi = Beach, SoundItsuha = One, LeafIromi = Recruitment, WingIyuki = the Reason, SnowIkuru = Good, ComeIyoko = Progress, ChildIyuka = Emphasis, Reason, Beautiful Ihaku = Support, WhiteIfuyu = Emphasis, WinterItsura = One, GoodIrochi = Vividness/Color, ClearIoko = Great/Excellent/Magnificent, Cord, ChildItoha = Thread, FeathersIzuna = Fountain Spring, Wild AppleChineko = Thousand, Sound, ChildChiori = Thousand, Cloth, Weaving Hinaki = Chick, Young Bird, Sunny Place, HollyhockShizuku = Drop, Trickle, Dripping Izuka so far doesn't have a meaning (or exist). It's just Izuku with an "a" at the end, and the nickname "Deka" doesn't work in the context of it being an insult as it doesn't mean anything compared to "Deku". Please do your research when it comes to topics and names please.
