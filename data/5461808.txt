Chapter Text
A Dragon’s Deathly Love I still remember when I first met him. I was just a small child and I had been running from branch to branch over the top of my village. There was a lot of excitement. Our village had had a hard winter and some of our number had perished due to starvation. The village elders had asked the Earth Aspect to come and create fertile earth for us to grow more crops so it never happened again.
The elders had heard that he would come today so the village had been preparing like mad for his arrival. There had been a huge scream as a huge black dragon had flown over the village, landing in a little area not far from the village. Everyone else had been too scared to go there, had gathered in the middle of the village. I ran all the way there. I watched from the trees as the dragon landed and then turned round and round in a circle.
I jumped down and walked right up to him. He caught sight of me and looked down at me curiously. He reached his huge head all the way down until I was dwarfed by his jaw. He flashed his huge white teeth and tilted his head. I giggled and reached out a hand to touch his scales, stroking him like a cat.“Brave Little One. Most would run screaming at just the sight of me.” He said.“But you’re not scary.” I replied, crossing my arms.He reared his head back and laughed. Then he’d shrunk. He turned into a man right in front of my eyes and I’d smiled at him with my head tilted.“Now you definitely don’t look scary.” I said.“Ah My Brave Little One, you truly are a breath of fresh air.” He laughed, bowing at me.“Are you coming to our village?” I asked.“Yes I am.” He replied. “Perhaps you could show me the way?”“No. I’m going to run back and you’re too old to keep up with me.” I replied, smugly.“Bet I can keep up with you, My Brave Little One.” He smiled.I shrugged and then ran all the way back to the village. He kept up the whole way and it was only a few years later that I realised he was going slower for me. As we ran into the village everyone had gasped and my Father had grabbed me roughly making me cry out. “I would like to apologise to you, My Lord, for anything my daughter did to upset you. She will be punished, I swear!” My Father said angrily.“Father!” I whined and tried to pull my arm from his grip.My Father slapped me once round the face but I didn’t cry out, I never did, and instead stood there glaring at him. He raised his hand to hit me again but Lord Neltharion grabbed his arm with a growl. My father froze in terror at the sound and almost died on the spot, I swear.“Do not do that ever again. She is a brave, sweet child. She did no wrong and instead greeted me unlike any of you.” Neltharion said dangerously.No one ever raised a hand to me again.  The next time I saw him it was when he betrayed everyone. I was fully grown but still young.  We had all been fighting the burning legion, trying to send them back to their own homeland. The Aspects had arrived and we thought the battle was won. Instead it felt like all had been lost. Neltharion betrayed us all. He drained the other aspects of their powers and killed just as many alliance members with his new weapon as he did demons. I had been on the front lines and I should have been one of the dead but Neltharion’s blast had missed me.
After the battle I just wander for what feels like days. I stumble across him in his human form and I just stand there staring at him. He smiles when he sees me and comes over to greet me happily. I’m not even thinking when I throw my fist out and hit him square in the nose. He looks stunned.“Ah My Brave Little One, I have missed you.” He grins.“You son of a bitch!” I yell and lash out at him again.He catches my arm to stop my blow and I find myself being held against him with my wrists gripped behind my back. I struggle but stop when I feel his erection rubbing against me. I gasp and froze but he just grins. It is then that I can see the madness in his eyes. “Ah My Brave Little One, it would be so much fun to mate with you until your belly was full with my child. Our children would be so brave and strong.” He smirks.“No! I hate you! My whole village was in the front line of that battle and you killed them all!” I scream at him.“So? I watched over you all these years. Your village treated you badly. They treated you like dirt but it was because you were braver, stronger and faster than them all. You are a true warrior and they hated you for it.” He snarls at me.“I still loved them.” I sigh, looking away from his eyes.“Perhaps, but they didn’t deserve it.” He whispers into my ear.“No they didn’t deserve it! They didn’t deserve the way they died! They didn’t deserve to be killed by the one being that they trusted to protect them! I hate you! You’re a monster and I hate you!” I scream
