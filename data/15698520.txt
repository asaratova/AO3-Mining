James walks into the kitchen and the first thing he does is stumble— honest to god stumble, his perfectly-honed assassin coordination be damned— and over thin air no less. He keeps himself upright, just barely, using the kitchen counter as a crutch, mitigating the strength of his metal hand on sheer instinct, but all of that barely registers because he only has eyes for the man in front of him.Tony is on the phone with someone. He’s leaning casually against the sink, twirling a spoon in a cup of coffee, dressed one of his fancy suits, although the shirt’s top two buttons are undone and the tie is hanging loose around his neck. Tony’s hair is in disarray, likely after he ran his hand through it half a dozen times, his expression is animated, and that pretty little mouth of his is chattering away, speaking flawless, smooth-as-whiskey, rapid-fire Russian.James swallows hard, mouth suddenly going dry, and he struggles to focus on the actual content of the conversation as his heart rate spikes and his stomach begins to perform elaborate somersaults. He knows that Tony isn’t fond of working with the Russian government, for a myriad of reasons, but he made several good non-political acquaintances when he was over there last year, cleaning up the mess they all left behind in Siberia. He must be talking to one of these people now, something about clean energy, but that’s all James registers because he’s far too enthralled with the man himself to pay attention to anything else.Admittedly, Tony in any form is a gorgeous sight, but there’s something about Tony and that Russian that makes James’ whole body light up with heat, makes it tingle pleasantly all the way down to his fingers and toes.An awful part of his mind informs him that it’s because he’s still broken, that he came back as something terrible, monstrous, something other than the charming, good-hearted Bucky Barnes everyone else expected, and there’s still some pathetic part of him that craves orders in this language, that needs someone to tell him what his next mission is, what to do, who to kill—No, that’s not it, he tells himself, refuses to listen to that dark whisper. Instead, he listens to the Russian falling effortlessly from Tony’s lips. Of course, James is broken, that much is true, he’s a mess of jagged pieces shoved back together haphazardly and none-too-gently, but he’s certain that this newfound fascination isn’t tied to his trauma. James remembers what their Russian sounded like, the harsh, bark-like orders of his handlers, as sharp as a slap to the face, the slithering monotone of the scientists, like putrid slime crawling out of their mouths.Tony’s Russian is nothing like that. Sure, his grammar, the word choice, it’s as natural as a native’s, but his pronunciation is just a touch off. Just a hint of an accent, and if James strains to pinpoint it, he thinks it’s Italian, as if Tony’s Italian roots are actually more pronounced like this when he’s speaking something other than English. The words are lyrical, graceful, like poetry, and for the first time, James understands the true beauty of this language.He gets a little lost in the way Tony’s full lips shape themselves around the lengthy, consonant-heavy words, the way that tongue curls around the r’s like a caress, the rhythmic tempo of the one-sided conversation. Tony notices him of course, hard not to when James is standing there at the entrance like an idiot, staring. All Tony does however is quirk an amused eyebrow, then offers a genuine half-smile and a wiggle of his fingers in greeting. He doesn’t pause the conversation, a continued cascade of Russian still flowing over the space around them, but he does look away again, back to spooning an ungodly amount of sugar into his coffee.James can’t look away, doesn’t want to, although he does choose to focus on the butterflies in his stomach instead of the fact that he’s very nearly turned on just from listening to this man talk.If Tony keeps this up, James might have to say ‘screw it’, abandon the entire elaborate plan of slowly and meticulously wooing this man, and taste that Russian for himself, make it his own, kiss Tony right here and now in the middle of the Avengers Compound kitchen.Terrible, awful, no-good idea, even if he and Tony have been… dancing around each other for months now, but it took them so long to get here and James doesn’t want to jeopardize all that hard work.To no one’s surprise, after the pardons first came avoidance, one that would’ve lasted indefinitely, until one night, they stumbled into each other and one sharp word turned into more and more and more, until they were both screaming, sobbing messes, both lashing out, at each other, at themselves, and mourning everything that was ruthlessly ripped away from them.From that blossomed a tentative friendship, softer, simpler, less burdened. Then, it wasn’t long before they were flirting, circling each other like two orbiting suns, slowly getting closer and cl
