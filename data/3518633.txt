Sam 100% moved into the tower with a shitload of cracked-out superheroes because he got a great offer at a VA in the city, not because he wanted to keep an eye on a couple of old-ass self-destructive super soldiers and one stone cold whipcord of a woman who could tase him any day she liked, Tony.Sam was a professional. And Sam was just crunchy granola enough to think talking about feelings and discussing coping mechanisms was the way out of the abyss for almost any vet on the brink. New York was teeming with vets who couldn’t get housing and employment because of debilitating cases of PTSD and all the satellite diagnoses around it. Sam could be of use in New York, and if he got the bonus of flying around making sure his best guy wasn’t getting into scrapes he couldn’t get out of, well, what was the harm?That didn’t mean he’d signed up for this.Barnes held his tablet out to Sam in his right hand while he used his metal hand to point at the screen.The screen which was currently playing some freaky bisexual pegging porn in one window and an “It Gets Better” video in another. Earnest entreatments to keep going in the face of bigotry and discrimination were just not meant to have a soundtrack of squelches and moans, and, well, earnest entreatments to keep going. “Um,” Sam said.“The internet says I can make time with whoever I want and no one can give me electroshock,” Barnes said.Sam’s heart swooped and he pressed his lips together. He crossed his arms because if he wasn’t careful, one of his hands might make its way to Barnes’s shoulder to give it a squeeze, and he wasn’t sure they were there yet. Being the coming-out point man had never been his professional speciality, but this was personal and he could handle it. Especially if it meant the mutual pining on floor 498 would come to an end. “That’s right,” Sam said. “The way we think of sexuality is different than it used to be. More open and more accepting, though it’s certainly not a paradise. If you ever want more resources—”“I have to show Clint,” Barnes said, tapping his tablet off and trundling it up under one arm. “And Pepper Potts.” Barnes, for no reason Sam could figure out, had developed a puppy-like affinity for Ms. Potts, and she’d taken it with the kind of compassion and aplomb that made Sam want to kiss her, but man, she didn’t deserve this. “Uh, hey, maybe not?”“Why?” Barnes tilted his head at him, blue eyes wide and clear. He reminded Sam of innocence, but the kind of innocence people talked about when they talked about ravening wolves. Now, Sam wasn’t into sex negativity or shaming folks for pretty much anything, that was just some bullshit, but there was such a thing as discretion and appropriate venues and social contracts, and Barnes hadn’t really gotten the memo on any of it just yet, even six months after Sam and Steve had coaxed him in from the cold.“I mean, I’m pretty sure Clint would be into the whole package,” he said, waving his hand around at the tablet. “But Pepper might be less into the, uh, blue movie and more into the one where the girl talks about her life and then shows us her weird ugly dog.”“He’s a pug/chihuahua, and he’s old.” Barnes hid the tablet and scowled at him. Sam tried not to let out the laugh caught in his gullet. “Sorry, dude,” Sam said. “It’s a super cute weird ugly dog, and maybe you could send the link to Ms. Potts in an email.”“I can copy/paste,” Barnes said. “Awesome.”“But there are lots of different blue movies, which one do you think she’d like?”

It was an ordinary Wednesday night when Maria Hill finally looked Sam up and down and said, “How would you feel about me using you for your body?”Of course, Sam said, “Ma’am, yes, ma’am,” and Maria pinned him to the bed, hit him repeatedly in the face with her tiny perfect boobs, the angels sang, and that was that.

Colonel Rhodes and Tony Stark were in the communal kitchen arguing about Beyoncé. Sam almost died when he met Colonel Rhodes last year, and he was pretty sure he was still having heart palpitations about it, and he was loath to agree with Tony Stark on anything, but he could not stand idly by while the good Colonel — while anyone! — insulted the queen.“Hold up, hold up, hold up,” Sam said, and Tony Stark and the Colonel paused in their bickering to blink a matching pair of pretty brown eyes at him. “Colonel Rhodes, are you saying you don’t like Beyoncé?”“I’m just saying she’s no Whitney, is that so wrong?” Colonel Rhodes said. “Nobody’s Whitney!” Sam cried. “Nobody’s asking her to be Whitney! We get to have both! Life is beautiful!”“This is what I’m talking about!” Tony Stark crowed, slapping Sam on the back. “Wilson knows what’s up, I always knew it. Now let me make you some new wings, I don’t trust that Wakandan stuff for a minute.” Tony winked, or maybe it was a twitch, but Sam rolled his eyes.“Man, don’t even,” he said, shrugging out from under Tony’s hand. “Buy Black.”“Buy American!”“Shut up, Tony,” Colonel Rhodes said, but Tony wave
