Chapter 1: Tony Stark / Ironman
    




Chapter Text
You’re lucky, you suppose. You’re born with your soulmate’s name inked into the words that are suppose to identify him. Still, the phrase ‘Tony Stark. Maybe you’ve heard of me?’ drawn in slanted chicken scratch down the inside of your left arm sounds a bit pretentious and a quick flip through any news channel would tell you that your other half is as well. One of the richest men on earth, a superhero, and a notorious narcissist. His face is plastered nearly everywhere in New York, and it’s almost embarrassing when you don’t recognize him, but equating billionaire-super hero to the asshole who just cut you in the line for Starbucks isn’t exactly the first thing on your mind at 7:30 on a Monday morning. “I’m sorry, but who the actual fuck do you think you are?”He casts a look over his shoulder and says seven words that change your life.
