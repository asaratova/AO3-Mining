Chapter 1: Questionable Strength
    




Chapter Text
It all started with a question. Nothing too bad, just a simple little question from a passing fan.It was after a particularly exhausting fight. One that was so taxing that the entire team willingly allowed themselves to be checked over by the medics, too tired to complain or put up resistance. A few civilians were also being treated, which led us to the question that one of the younger fans asked.“Which one of you is strongest?”An innocent question. Asked by a boy who couldn’t have been older than ten. But it sparked something that would go down in the history books, if the Avengers ever spoke about it in public.***“I think it’s the Hulk.”Everyone looks up at the young teen. Peter Parker just glances around and shrugs.“What are you talking about this time, kid?” Tony Stark sighs at his mentee.“What the kid said earlier,” the spiderling explains. “About the strongest Avenger. It’s been stuck in my head all night. I think it’s the Hulk. With Thor as a close second.”“I believe I am much stronger than the Hulk,” Thor frowns at the young one’s comment.“Gotta disagree with you on that,” Bruce raises his hand from his position on the couch. “At least, the Hulk does. He’s kind of growling at you in my head.”“I did beat you on Sakaar,” Thor glares at the scientist, although everyone knows it’s actually at the green giant inside.“That’s an application of strength,” Bruce argues back in his alter ego’s favor. “You’ve had more combat training and are better able to utilize your strength. The Hulk is still stronger in terms of pure muscle.”“Gotta agree with him there,” Natasha joins the argument, from her position next to Bruce on the couch. “I can take down Cap and Barnes sometimes, and I’m not enhanced. Gotta be in Big Green’s corner for this argument.”“He says thank you,” Bruce smiles up at the spy.“I’m actually with Thor on this one,” Steve picks a side.“I’m with Bruce,” Tony chooses the other. “There’s a reason why he and Hulk are the ‘Strongest Avenger’.”And thus, the next Civil War begins.***“Do they always have to go this overboard with their arguments?”“C’mon, you must be curious.”“I am, but this even you have to admit this is a little much.”Pepper is currently standing next to Rhodey, shaking her head at the gathering of scientists, one of which happens to be her fiancé. They are currently in a lab, going over the readings of various different body samples that they’d painstakingly extracted from every single hero they know with enhanced strength. They’d decided that if they wanted to do this with Thor and Hulk, they might as well do it with everyone.Some of them took more convincing than others (read Jessica Jones and Luke Cage), but they were convinced. Hulk, because they wanted to get some samples while he was dominant, was actually pretty patient with the entire process. The most difficult part of it all was finding something that could penetrate some of their enhanced skin.
Displayed next to each separate reading is a screen showing each of the enhanced doing various levels of strength training to see if they could find their limits through the old-fashioned way. It mostly involved the use of weights, but a couple of the ones with similar builds actually tried to arm wrestle for fun.“Ha!” Shuri holds out her hand to Tony Stark. “Pay up!”“You don’t even need this,” Stark holds out a hundred-dollar bill. “You’re richer than me. Seriously, I’m Tony Stark, and you’re richer than me.”“It’s not the money,” Shuri takes the cash triumphantly. “It’s the satisfaction. I told you that Jones could beat my brother.”“And you even bet against your own flesh and blood.”“I’ve known him for my entire life,” she shrugs. “And I know his limits.”***“Okay. The results are in.”Shuri, Tony, Jane Foster, Helen Cho, and Bruce Banner; along with their collection of assistants; stand side by side in front of the collection of heroes and vigilantes.“For safety reasons,” Stark continues. “This list will not be publicly displayed, although you may gloat if you wish. We will also be keeping the actual numbers and results of our scientific studies locked up so tight that not even we will be able to get into it easily, so don’t worry about that. Now, Ms. Cho will be the one announcing the scoring.”The expert medical doctor addresses the tablet in her hand as she tries to suppress the smirk on her face.“I’ll just get straight to it,” she decides. “We’ll have the list on the holoscreen to let anyone here review their own placing, but the title of ‘Strongest Avenger’, as far as these results show, goes to… The Hulk!”There are cheers. There are groans. There’s money passed around. Thor, for his part, takes it all in stride. He walks up and pats Bruce on the shoulder, laughing loudly the whole time.“Alright everyone,” Helen continues. “Results are posted, don’t whine if you didn’t beat someone. We’re all going to act like mature adults here.”There was whining, there was also an equal and gr
