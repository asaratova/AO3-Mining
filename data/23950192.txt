‘Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.’ - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

The Tesseract is not only active, she’s...” the doctor clearly searched for a better word, only to come up with, “—behaving.”Fury’s jaw twitched. “How soon can you pull the plug?”“She’s an energy source: we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...”“We prepared for this, Doctor; harnessing energy from space.”“We don’t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete...-”Fury’s eye returned to the Tesseract as Selvig continued his report, “...-Nothing harmful, low levels of Gamma radiation.”His head snapped back to stare at the doctor, “That can be harmful.” Jaw tight, Fury gave a quick sweep of the rest of the compound, “Where’s agen—”Before he could finish though, the Tesseract hummed, glowing even brighter. “Doctor! It’s spiking again,” cried out one of Selvig’s minions.Both Selvig and Fury moved towards the call, eyes falling on the nearby screen. It displayed a graph tracking real-time energy emissions; not only was there an increased frequency of spikes, but also an increased intensity.— The Cube sparked once more, a much larger spike then those previous.“What’s that?” Fury’s singular eye had already locked onto the Cube, and before he could so much as tense, it sparked again — the ground and walls visibly shook.It continued to spark more and more, each spark bigger than the last until it seemed as though it would spontaneously combust...—And it did: An explosion of blue-white light-energy rippled out, tendrils grasping at the very top of the chamber... ...Most dissipated......... Though a small residue continued to linger.And yet, this residue was not the only thing that remained; as the light dimmed, and visual returned, silhouettes took form.Confusion and concern ran through Fury as he took in the several unknowns now on the platform, each odder than the last. In the centre was a dark-haired kid - ten or eleven, if Fury had to guess - a bloodied sword in hand. Yet, he was not the oddest thing. That was reserved for the brightest tropical bird he had ever seen, equipped with a wide colourful wing-span and a long tail rivalling that of a peacock’s, which hovered above the boy.

 Harry bit back a groan; his whole body ached.One moment he was in Slytherin’s Secret Chamber, trying to make sense of having met and defeated Voldemort for the third time. Of having somehow survived a basilisk’s bite thanks to Fawkes. The tears had done much more than simply saving Harry from the venom; somehow, they also managed to remove the bite-mark from his ankle and correct his eyesight (which was rather a good thing given that one of his lenses was completely broken, the frame not faring much better).All this occurred while he simultaneously attempted to reassure Ginny that Riddle was gone, passing her the fang-pierced diary. In the next moment, a great big ball of light and energy had formed in front of their very eyes. —Harry had pushed Ginny out of the way, not wanting her to get injured. Then, he was jerked irresistibly forward. He sped into the howl of wind and swirling colour, and then —His feet slammed into the ground; only the sword still in hand kept him steady, stopping him from falling over...Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he’d just travelled several hundred miles by Floo powder.Slowly, he looked around him... only to stop dead in his tracks.While most likely still underground, he wasn’t in the Chamber anymore... or anywhere in Hogwarts. And while Fawkes was still with him, flying overhead, neither Ginny or the diary —or even the bloody basilisk, were anywhere in sight.He gawked at the space, filled with various muggle machines and people facing him. People approaching him. Not to mention the muggle clothes — and the
