Peggy Carter kissed Steve Rogers once, in 1945. That’s what history knows. Colonel Phillips told the story to a documentarian in the mid-70s, the fond reminiscence of an old, old man.It’s a secret that hurts no one to tell, he thinks at the time. After all, Steve Rogers has been dead since 1945. Peggy Carter, since 1963.That’s what he thinks. That’s what history knows.History, Peggy has learned, never tells the whole story. There are always gaps. Like: history says Abraham Erskine was a kind man who dreamed of a better world, a soft touch for an underdog-- which is true enough. But history also says his serum was only ever successfully tested once, that he only ever chose one man to use it on.That’s false. Or at least, incomplete. But it was their secret, hers and the good doctor’s, and he took it to his grave.She hasn’t taken it to hers, yet. She’s not sure if she ever will.Two can keep a secret, if one of them is dead. Peggy learned the truth of that a long, long time ago. She’s been left with a lot of secrets to keep, down the years. Like: Peggy Carter doesn’t age, not like a normal woman. Peggy Carter faked her death, with a little help from Howard Stark. Peggy Carter found out there was a cancer at the heart of SHIELD, and she’s been trying to stop the rot for a long, long time.Peggy Carter is old, and tired far beyond the years she wears on her face, and fighting a losing battle. History is pretty clear about what usually happens to people in her position.It’s lucky, then, that history is often wrong.***Peggy has not had the luxury of sentimentality in a very long time. Her one concession is a bottle of wine, every ten years, on the anniversary of the date on her gravestone.The first bottle she drinks with Howard, in a safehouse that’s been swept for bugs by them both enough times that they almost feel able to relax. It’s the first time they’ve been face-to-face in nearly half a decade, and he looks tired in a way that she still doesn’t, gray in his hair and lines on his face.They toast Zola’s death, though Peggy wishes it had been a less natural end. Lord knows she did her best, but the little worm had friends in high places. Dead women can’t pull so many strings as live men. For that matter, live women usually can’t either.It’s a hopeful night, at any rate. They’ve lived ten years with the knowledge that Hydra has its hooks in their government, their society, the organization they built up from nothing, and now that the man responsible is dead, perhaps they’ve reached a tipping point.At the twenty-year anniversary, Peggy drinks her bottle alone. Howard’s dead, and Hydra’s influence has grown beyond anything she could have anticipated. Alexander Pierce’s ascendancy has made for a rough decade. Peggy has spent ten years bugging offices, stealing documents, trying to get close enough to Pierce to take him down. But a one-woman crusade, with her allies all dead or too old to be of use, isn’t the sort of thing that stands good odds. She still hopes, but Hydra has proven true to its name, its tendrils multiplying too fast for her to fight. It’s frankly a miracle that they haven’t caught and killed her yet, all things considered. The thirty-year is worse. Peggy’s spent more of the intervening decade on the run than on the offensive. Pierce is bad, but she’s begun to suspect that there’s more to it than Pierce. Some malevolent intelligence is masterminding Hydra’s continued growth, something older and smarter than Pierce by far. She’s nearly desperate enough to go to the new head of SHIELD and confess all, but she doubts she’d get more than a bullet between the eyes for her trouble. Nicholas Fury was Pierce’s choice for the position, after all.By the forty-year, she’s gone to ground entirely. She takes mercenary work here and there, a too-long lifetime of well-honed skills making her useful, when she can bring herself to compromise the woman she used to be. Saving SHIELD from itself seems an unlikely dream. She expect the next decade will pass much the same, if she lives to see the end of it. History suggests as much.History, it turns out, doesn’t know shit. Peggy’s offered a job protecting an Iranian engineer in 2005, and nearly backs out when they try to partner her with another merc. But the other woman looks her up and down and shrugs, smiles with a bitter twist to her mouth, says “I usually work solo, but if you think you can keep up, why not?”Peggy doesn’t look much older than this redheaded chit of a girl, not really, but damned if she’ll be shown up by an infant who thinks she knows spycraft. She takes the job.The girl earns a little bit of grudging respect when she’s still conscious at the bottom of the cliff, and together they drag their engineer from the wreckage. The respect solidifies when a masked man with a shining silver arm catches up to them, and the girl turns out to know how to handle herself in a firefight. Between the two of them, they get their engineer out of the line of fi
