Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
Prologue.It seemed only right to be standing over the empty grave of an undead man. The file Natasha had given him was stained, well-thumbed, a bit ragged at the edges. Bucky's face was gaunt and frozen under glass; a death mask. Clipped to that ghastly photograph was the Bucky he recognized: warm smile, jaunty tilt to the hat. Steve snapped the pages shut, his fingers pressed white against the manila. Cyrillic writing. Case No. 17, Volume 2, March 23, 1945—Christ."You're going after him, aren't you?" Sam asked, and Steve gritted his teeth to stop the words from spilling out: yes, of course he was, and if he'd gone after Bucky all those years ago, after Bucky had fallen, he could maybe have saved Bucky all these years of fucking torment—"You don't have to come with me," Steve said finally."I know," Sam said, and then he sighed and said, "When do we start?""Soon," Steve replied absently. He slid the folder into his jacket and zipped it, and later, he realized this was the moment he'd stopped telling polite untruths ("That's fine," "I don't mind," "I'd be happy to,") and started telling outright lies, because he'd already started searching for Bucky and he would never stop, no matter what.
