Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It's just another night for you, rushing through chilly Brooklyn streets, your medical bag in hand. You know your destination; a stunning double wide brownstone, or rather, its basement. Your job. Your day to day.You wished this new normal was anything but. 
______________________
It had begun months ago, in a butchery. You were down to your last few dollars, your references in hand, with every hope and reason to be hired on; except for your gender placing a wedge in your plans. "No need for a woman in here, Miss," Butcher Jenkins raised your blood with his words. "I can't be runnin' after you, trimming your cuts, fixing your mess ups. Times is tight." Oh and you - so polite a candidate - couldn't keep the sass from your tongue. "I'd be fixing your trimmings, Jenkins, with your half cocked eye and shaky hands!" You knew you'd cost yourself your chance; so why not go on? "Your apprentice knows less; most beef sold here bubbles down to fat in a sauce pan!" He finally built up his words, red-faced. "You get your hide from my shop this instant! Broad like you thinkin' you know a sirloin from a hind cut!" "Speak like that again and I'll show you the difference 'tween a jugular and a trachea!" The threat went over his head as you slammed the door to his establishment, rafters shaking and startling his other customers. It was just your luck that one Steven Grant Rogers was in that day for an order of steaks. You'd piqued his interest. ______________________The first Great War took your father; the second took your husband. Most everything had gone downhill from there.  Your father had brought you up in his own butchery, teaching you cuts and organs long before you'd one day take up the mantel of nurse and midwife. In that, you excelled - you rejected potential suitors, marriage proposals, in favor of your work - but all it took was one still birth in the lap of one of Brooklyn's chattiest slanderers, and your reputation was dashed. Your quick temper and stubborn pride ensured it wouldn't recover. Your marriage with Edgar was by no means a fairytale. You needed someone to marry, he needed someone to run his home. Over the short years you grew close, kind to each other. Kind enough to produce a son; the true love of your life. And for a time, you were a family. You, Edgar, and dearest Billy. But then came the second war; and Roosevelt called a draft. And quite suddenly, it was just you and Billy. ______________________The room is hot, there are groans of agony and pain. Blood stains older blood, and cigarette smoke fills the chamber."Hang in there, Buck; Doc's on her way."  A regular night for the King of Brooklyn. Steve's new normal worked for him quite fine. Spotting you in Jenkins' Meats was entirely by chance, but he'd call it destiny. The flame in you had caught his eye, but your knowledge sparked his interest. He'd never met a woman who knew the word jugular, much less what it was. His gears were spinning by the time he left the shop; he could see wild potential. It didn't take much digging to learn about you; Y/N Y/L/N, war widow, mother to an orphaned son, and a skilled woman with a penchant for guff. Further research told him your skills were in nursing, birthing, minor cutting up - and the daughter of a butcher. His heart swooned; you were just what he needed. Not for play - yet - but for work. He was, after all, a businessman. And business was bloody. Crime usually was. Brooklyn was his pride and joy, and he ran it's foulest workings like he'd been born for it; but there were bound to be snags, mishaps. Gangs clashed, territories were fought over, and blood spilt. Enough that they needed a doctor. But doctors - pretentious, high-and-mighties with moral compasses and hippocratic oaths - would need to be paid off, coerced, threatened into servitude. Time, money, muscle; all of which Steve was a skin flint over. No, what was easier, was existing desperation. Somebody who'd already lost almost everything, that was what he had his heart set on. And then, there you were, fallen right into his lap, practically gift wrapped. What luck. ______________________Blood, blood, blood; and he screamed extra loud when you dug the bullet from his shoulder. You'd seen all manner of slug in men's flesh, since falling under Steve Rogers' employ. Tonight it is a mean hunk of lead, the size of a chestnut, struck deep into the meat and bone of James Barnes; jumped to save his friend and boss. People bled for Steve Rogers. You'd seen that too. He finally settled, passing out from pain and loss of blood, as you sewed up the muscle and sinew as neatly as you could. It was by no means pretty, he'd bear a vicious scar; but with luck and cleaning, he would live. Steve had his boys, Dugan and Dernier, bring Barnes up to his bunk; the poor sod would sleep til morning. As it had been for countless nights, you were left alone, with Steve, in his basement stunk of blood, cleaning up his mess. It was everything no
