Chapter Text
\When you find Charles Xavier, you know you’ve finally, finally done something right.You’ve been able to feel him since you were a child. The presence of another telepath—it lights up the air like a beacon, a constant thrum of energy that pulses in your head, little pieces of sights and sounds and smells from a life that’s not your own. You couldn’t communicate with words—the distance was too much—but you could see pictures, little pieces of his emotions, and you knew him, even though you didn’t even know his name. You’d known him your whole life.And then, years later, you hear his voice. Loud and echoing in your head, just repeating the same string of numbers, over and over again—coordinates—so you get in your car and you drive and when you meet him—Fuck. He’s perfect.He’s distinctly boyish, with wide blue eyes and brown hair that is just a little curly, standing in the front lawn wearing oxfords and a sweater-vest even though it’s eighty degrees outside—somehow you’d expected that. He stares at you for a moment, and his brow furrows, like he’s confused, like he doesn’t know, and then he makes a sound between a laugh and a choked-off sob, and just smiles so wide it looks like it hurts.He starts walking towards you. Slowly, at first, and then faster and faster, until he’s running across the lawn, crashing into you and sweeping you up into a crushing hug.“God,” he breathes. “It’s you. It’s really you.”There’s a long pause as you both try to reorient yourselves, try to get away from the rampant electricity of just being so close to another telepath—you can feel him, inside your head, so distinctly there, the rush of his emotions almost too much to handle, after spending so long being the only one able to feel it. He chuckles, and then you do, too, and pretty soon you’ve both dissolved into breathless, disbelieving laughter.There is a man behind the two of you, standing in the grass with his hands tucked into his pockets. He’s sharply dressed, and a pair of dark sunglasses covers his eyes. You don’t notice him until he speaks. “Cute,” he interrupts idly, rocking back on his heels with just the barest traces of a smile flitting across his face. “Who’s your friend, Charles?”Charles. The name fits. It fits almost too well, has a familiar ring to it that makes you smile again. He—Charles—hesitates a moment, and blinks, like he’s coming out of a trance. He pulls away, almost reluctantly, and clears his throat.“Ah—Erik. This is—well. It’s complicated,” he begins. “She’s—she’s like me. A telepath.”The man, Erik, nods slowly, and then offers you his hand to shake. You take it. “I’m (Name),” you say.“Erik Lehnsherr,” he replies. “I assume you’re here to stay?”A wide smile spreads across your face. “I guess I am.”~*~*~*~*~*~*~For a while, you and Charles Xavier are inseparable.It’s just—It’s overwhelming, being near another telepath, but that’s not it, it’s more than that. It’s how the two of you balance each other out, how you fit together, like you had only been half of a whole, incomplete, unimportant, until you’d met him. Your lives meld together so seamlessly it’s both terrifying and exhilarating, it’s something you never want to let go of. Not even once, not now that you’ve found him.Three weeks pass, and it’s a thrill that still hasn’t faded. It’s a thrill that becomes something else. “—and remember the carnival? When you were nine—““Oh, god, no, not the carnival,” Charles laughs, his eyes crinkling up at the edges. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Spinning teacups are awful.”“Your face,” you say, giggling. “God, you were terrified.”“It wasn’t funny,” he complains, trying and failing to suppress his crooked smile. He cards his fingers through his hair, brushing it out of his eyes. You grin.“Yes, it was.”“Right, how about your whipped cream fiasco, then? That was worse,” he teases.“Oh, no, no, no. I do not want to remember that,” you say, your nose scrunching up. “Gross.”Charles laughs quietly, and leans back against the couch cushions. The two of you lapse into a charged silence. It’s not uncomfortable, just kind of strange. Granted, most things are between the two of you.“Don’t you think it’s weird?” you ask, after a moment. “Us, having lived through so many moments together the way we did.”He looks at you searchingly for a moment. “I don’t know,” he murmurs, staring up at the ceiling. You sigh, and rest your head on his shoulder.He tenses.You don’t want to notice, but you do. There is a small pause. He’s uncertain, uncomfortable, surprised, a rush of emotions that swirl through your head.Charles clears his throat. “I can feel you,” he says quietly. “More so than before. You’re in my head. How are you doing that?”You look up at him.  “It just happens,” you reply, trying to appear nonchalant. “Telepathy through physical contact. It makes my powers stronger. I don’t know why.”“I see,” hurmurs. “That’s—odd. I’ve never heard of anything like it.”Carefu
