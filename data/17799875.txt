Chapter Text
Ganke had written out and pinned to his bulletin board a list of names which he was now busy reading through so that Miles would understand the full extent of how he felt about him coming in unannounced through the window again.Ganke was a good guy, a calm guy, the kind of guy you wanted on your team if for no other reason than because his chill in the face of what most people would call insanity was vaguely threatening. He’d stared at Miles straight in the face after they’d finally had a frank conversation about the whole, ‘why do you sneak out at night, every night, like a loser?’ thing and had given him a good squint, up and down.Miles realized later that in that moment, he’d been weighed, measured, and found severely wanting.Ganke was not a big fan, nor a huge fan of Spiderman. No, see, that didn’t even begin to cover how Ganke felt about Spiderman. He had every single one of the guy’s comics. He had Spidey t-shirts, jackets, backpacks, keychains, a phone background—he even had Spidey slippers which Miles was gratified to learn were essentially blue, furry monstrosities with eight dragging little legs bursting out from either side of them. Apparently, they were supposed to be 3D versions of the emblem on the back of the original Spidey suit.Given that this was not a battle he had any chance of winning, Miles decided that he’d keep his thoughts on just how accurate all them little feet were to himself. He ruminated on them, though, while Ganke rattled off some of the new invectives he’d added to the list in Miles’s absence.They were so blue. Like, blue raspberry sherbet blue. Jolly Ranchers blue.“Dude, are you even listening?” Ganke demanded.“Huh?” Miles said reflexively.Ganke groaned and grumbled and waved a grumpy hand back at Miles over his shoulder to dismiss him from further conversation. It was almost a relief. Except.“Hey man, guess which dumpster I fell in this time,” he goaded.Ganke whipped around in his computer chair and produced two pens from his desk to make the sign of the cross at him.“Touch nothing, demon,” he threatened.Miles hummed long and thoughtfully.“I dunno,” he drawled, “I’m feeling a little sad, man.”“Don’t you dare—”“A lady called me a menace today, right to my face. Could really use a hug.”“You are a menace. That is exactly what you are.”Miles made puppy eyes and pouted big and sad, slowly edging a hand towards the can on Ganke’s desk. Ganke hissed at him. He made a noise of disgust when Miles’s fingers made contact with the can.“There are easier ways to get a coke, Miles Morales,” he snapped. That was as good as permission. Miles swiped the can and beamed at him. He took a sip, it was flat, but so, so much sweeter with Ganke’s annoyance.  He emerged from his shower and received clearance to re-enter his and Ganke’s dorm room. He flopped down on his bed, at which point Ganke leaned back in his chair with one headphone on and said,“Oh, by the way, you got like six messages while you were in the shower.”Six?“Yeah, dunno if that’s good or bad.”He checked. The phone had way more than that. He unlocked the screen.No messages.“It’s Gwen,” he said.“Sending six messages?” Ganke clarified. He had accepted Gwen’s existence the same way he’d accepted Miles’s night job, at first with skepticism, then with a shrug. “She okay?”Miles never knew, he couldn’t ever open Gwen’s messages. They could only send them to each other. Ten messages was a lot, though, she must have really been trying to get his attention.“Maybe someone’s dying,” Ganke hypothesized.Someone’s always dying.It was nearly three, though; Gwen’s patrol typically ended around then, she’d be going home to sleep soon. Miles would call her after a few hours to reboot.  Someone was screaming. Far away. So far, it sounded like an echo.Miles thought he knew that voice from somewhere.Where had he heard it?Maybe on tv?He opened his eyes.It was black all around him, and blinking didn’t make any difference to that. The usual pulsing charging lights around his dorm were absent, and belatedly, he realized he was standing. He flexed his hands. They didn’t feel warm or cold, just empty. Or not. Was it empty? That felt kind familiar too, somehow.The screaming seemed like it was getting a little louder, like the buzz at the back of his brain. Miles’s feet started moving towards it. One in front of the other. He didn’t feel like he was walking, more like he was just moving his legs. There was nothing hard beneath them; just a shattering of color.Color?It was there, then gone; bursting out each time he set his foot down, like ripples almost, fading away into the blackness almost as quickly as it had arrived.Wait. He knew this place. Didn’t he know this place? How did he know this place?The screaming stopped. He stopped, too.He searched the blackness around him. The colors no longer arced out from his feet.His hand brushed something and he jerked his head over to see a few fading sparks of gold and teal and fl
