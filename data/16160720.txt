Chapter Text
Peter hated being put in a box.And yet Natasha kept doing it.“What is the point of this again?” he yelled to her through the metal wall.“I told you, it's in case you're ever trapped in the trunk of a car,” Natasha said. Peter sighed, annoyed more than anything and with a twist of his hips and a good kick, he busted the lid off his confining prison and hopped out. “That wasn't discreet,” Nat said with a frown.“Being discreet is a spy thing. I'm more for a dramatic entrance.” Peter turned to look back at the box. “Or rather, exit.”Peter was at the end of one of his Sunday training sessions with Natasha. While the younger spider was incredibly strong and could handle his own in a fight, Peter wanted to learn more. Especially when it came to hand to hand combat. Natasha was also teaching him other languages and she was trying to convince Tony to give him flying lessons. The latter wasn’t going too well.“You asked me to help you, Peter.” Natasha pointed out as she took a swig from her water bottle.“But really? What are the odds that someone manages to lock me in the trunk of a car?” Peter asked.“Someone dropped a building on you,” Natasha said pointedly. Peter pursed his lips, thinking back to said incident.“And,” Peter said slowly. “I managed to get out of it just fine…after a while. Besides, buildings are different, and I’ve learned since then.”“Weren’t you locked in a bank vault a couple weeks ago?” Bucky said from his usual corner perch. He liked to watch training sessions, occasionally giving input on Peter’s footwork or Natasha’s way of instruction. Peter wasn’t exactly sure of their complete history, but from the bits of info he has received, Bucky had known Nat when she was younger. It wasn’t until after the Winter Soldier was “defeated” that he ended up remembering her. It was complicated and both being such private people, Peter didn’t pry.“That one wasn’t my fault. I got out eventually.” Peter said. Nat gave him a look. “Okay, so Tony got me out. It still wasn’t a trunk.” Natasha just shook her head.“Come on, let’s work on your dodging,” Nat said, hauling him over to the larger mat. The trio was in the main training room of the Tower. The rest of the Tower residents were dotted around. The Asgardians had left after a quick stay on Midgard, saying they had business to attend to. Tony and Peter never did find out what Thor meant by going to see a wizard. Stark figured it was just all the beer the God of Thunder was putting away. Peter had other suspicious and he also wished they would have stayed longer. He wanted to talk to Loki again, but both brothers assured the Avengers they would be back soon.“Keep your back turned,” Bucky said as Nat picked up the first tennis ball. The whole team was fascinated by Peter’s “spidey-sense”. Tony still hated the name, but nonetheless, everyone still used it. He didn’t need to “train it” per se, but he knew it amused his teammates, so he humored them. The first ball came at his right shoulder and Peter neatly dodged it. Simply rotating slightly to let the ball hit the wall in front of him. Nat threw the second ball.“So, any word on the whole ‘Peter Parker isn’t actually a loser’ situation?” Natasha said as her hands chucked ball after ball towards Peter.“I’m not sure if that is an accurate name for it,” said Peter, dodging three balls on his left side. Natasha picked up batons. “I’m still a loser, just a loser with a cool job and superhero friends. Flash will most likely try to spin it some other way.” Peter decided, catching a baton behind his back and throwing it over his shoulder back to Natasha.“Didn’t Tony threaten anyone who bullies you again?” Bucky asked, rotating a tennis ball in his metal hand. Tony had worked all weekend and the damaged limb was good as new. Thor, however, was no longer allowed to throw Cap’s shield. Or anything for that matter.“Yeah, but you know kids. They never listen.” Peter said ducking, as a baton sailed over his head.“Are you including yourself in that?” Bucky asked.“Obviously. Let’s be honest, besides on missions, well most of them anyway, when do I ever actually listen and do what I’m told?” Peter said and easily side-stepped two more batons. Bucky smiled and shook his head, his long hair creating a curtain around his face.“And what about MJ?” Nat said. Behind his back, Peter could hear her picking up something new, knives maybe?“What about her?” Peter asked.“Peter, you are very good at hiding your secret identity, but hiding your feelings for that girl? It’s almost embarrassing.” Nat said. Peter sputtered trying to find the words when he nearly missed the flying projectile heading for his ankles. Peter jumped at the last second just as Cap’s shield slid against the floor. Peter whirled around to see Steve standing in the doorway with
