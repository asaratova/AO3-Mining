Chapter 1: P. J. S.
    




Chapter Text
     Tony doesn’t really recall much of that afternoon. (Probably because of all the drugs that had been forced down his throat.) However, even in his drunken haze, he knew that he’d never forget what little he remembers. How could he? The wailing, the barked orders, the armed men, the fight he had put up, the dizziness he had felt. But above anything else, the consuming powerlessness, the utter desperation and the blind panic pulsing through his veins as his mind reeled.
“PETER!! WHY MY SON?! DON’T TAKE HIM!! PLEASE!! MY BABY!! NO!!!” 
     That day may be the fifth anniversary of Peter James Stark’s disappearance, but the piercing cries of the three-year-old still echo through Tony’s mind. He was in his lab right now, crying while holding a glass of scotch. It’s not his first one and certainly not his last. This is how he spent this day. Trying not to be swallowed whole by grief and by memories of a once happy life. Clutching Peter’s favourite plushie (A Captain America teddy bear that had once belonged to Tony himself) and a picture of them together to his chest. A bittersweet reminder that no, his mind hadn’t made everything up.     He held the items closer to his chest.     “Dove sei, bambino?”
