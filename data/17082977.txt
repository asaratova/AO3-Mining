Grabbing your duffel bag, you walked out of your room and headed to the lounge to grab some coffee before leaving for the self-defense class you were invited to. You saw Steve and Sam heading out and stopped them.“Hey Steve where’re  you going?” You motioned with your hand, hoping to god he didn’t forget.“Uhh for a run? Why?” He asked and told Sam to go ahead.“Please tell me you didn’t forget!” You sighed at his obvious memory loss, making him attempt to remember what was going on.“The self-defense class. I told you I needed someone bigger than me to show the class. Come on man what the hell?” Your voice went a pitch higher making rub his temples at completely missing to put this on his schedule.“God I’m sorry Y/N I didn’t put it in my-”“Yeah yeah save it. Now what am I supposed to do?” You got your phone out to see if you were going to cancel when Bucky walked in in his pajamas and messy hair.“Buck can go!” Steve yelled, making your phone almost fall out of your hand.“What?” Bucky’s eyes shot open at the prospect of someone offering his services without him consent.You stared at each other for a couple of seconds before you explained what was happening. Seeing him rub his neck and grab the coffee meant for you made you hate the idea.“Sure.” He sipped his coffee and shrugged his shoulder, “I’ll be ready in five..” You narrowed your eyes at Steve once Bucky left, making him apologize again before leaving.You made coffee again and waited for him on the couch. When you heard his footsteps, you got up and carried your bag, looking up at him when he came into view.And this was exactly why you didn’t want him from the beginning. He always wore those stupid two-sizes smaller shirts that pronounced all of his muscles. But what you hated more than those shirts were his collection of grey sweatpants. You’d think he’d invest in more work out clothes considering the money available but no. He wore them everywhere.“Somethin wrong?” He looked at himself before looking back at you and you glared at him, shaking your head and telling him you were already late.“So..what is this for?” He buckled his seatbelt before you pressed the gas.“Didn’t I already tell you?” You hated how angry you sounded. Unfortunately for him, you were sexually frustrated and his presence didn’t exactly help your situation.“Well, I mean, why are you doing this?” He calmly responded, choosing to not look at you.“Uhh, it helps. As weird as it sounds, it helps me relax in a way, knowing that I can teach people how to defend themselves. I was once in their place and if I didn’t go to these classes, I would have never joined the forces and found you guys. The things they go through…no one deserves to go through that.”“You speaking out of experience?” The question surprised you but you knew that he meant well.“Sort of.” Deciding to not reveal anymore, you gave him a smile and kept driving, the rest of the ride silent after his last question.You walked into the class and greeted the trainers and the people taking the class, apologizing that you were late. Bucky stood in the corner, keeping his head down and realizing he should have probably worn a long sleeve shirt.“I know I promised you Captain America but he had to deal with something. So, I brought our very own Sergeant James Barnes. Before you complain, I think you’ll find that Sergeant Barnes is much more helpful. Don’t tell Steve I said this…” People laughed at the last comment and you saw that others were on edge that he was present.“I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one here uncomfortable that-” One of the new trainers spoke before you could finish your introduction. You knew someone was going to say this and you hoped it wouldn’t happen.“This is a reminder that I fully understand what I am doing and I would not have brought Sergeant Barnes to help with the training unless I knew that is is beneficial and safe. If anyone is “uncomfortable,” you can leave now.” You looked at the trainer and noticed him give you a not-so-convincing smile before nodding.“Thank you. Let’s start with our regular stretching exercises so find a partner and get to work.” You motioned for Bucky to walk over. He was still looking at the floor and you felt bad for how this all went.“I’m really sorry Bucky. I didn’t think this through. Please just forget abou-”“That’s fine doll. Thanks for defending my honor.” He dramatically bowed, making you hate how he always used humor to hide what he was really feeling.“Well then, let’s do this.” You told him the different exercises you usually did with them, realizing that this was only going to get worse.Beginning with the first one, you told him to take your right leg and begin to extend it overhead. Keeping his right knee to the inside of your leg on the ground, he locked his right ankle over your leg on the ground. His hand made its way down to your knee to keep it straight and you couldn’t help but take a deep breath, wanting to not look at him or focus on the way his hands
