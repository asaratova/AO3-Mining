Chapter Text
It started because JARVIS had locked him out of the workshop — which was not cool, Tony had been in the groove, on an upswing in productivity with Barton’s latest suggestions for his arrows, and a breakthrough in an improved wing design for Wilson. A break now would achieve nothing.Then JARVIS had asked Tony to tell him what day it was.The cheat.The AI knew that if Tony answered wrongly, Pepper’s Rules would fall into place, all the workshop would be locked down, and Tony wouldn't be allowed back to work unless he had eaten something, showered, had a nap of longer than twenty minutes, or he got another adult to sign off on him continuing to work.Tony swore it was still Saturday — a nice work weekend!There was no way it was Monday, it had to be a conspiracy.Thor wasn't in the Tower this week, and he couldn't find Steve either. Bruce refused to open his lab door to sign off on Tony working, which was just hurtful. Clint - the bastard - at least had the excuse of being suspended from the approved list after that last incident to say no and return to his target practise.Romanov was back from a solo mission though, and depending on how the mission had gone - Tony should check up on that - she could be feeling indulgent. There was a possibility that if he presented his case and appeared put together and not been-up-since-Friday that Romanov might, just might, let him work a little longer. So Tony had stomped off to his room to clean up. Freshly scrubbed and in clothes that didn't smell of engine oil, Tony checked with JARVIS where Romanov was, and headed to the living room. Humming quietly, Tony paused suddenly on the threshold.Natasha was curled up on the large sofa, entirely swaddled in a green blanket, only visible from the nose up. She had her eyes trained on the TV, but Tony bet she’d noticed his presence. He’d never seen her use the TV before, or do anything other than training in the gym. Tony had assumed she just kept to her suite, notoriously private, which Tony could understand. It had him curious about what she was watching now though.“Is that…” Tony held back the bizarre urge to laugh. “Is that From Russia with Love?”Natasha turned her head like an owl, those eyes shooting daggers in the dark, daring Tony to say more.So, of course, he had to, “Not too on the nose for you?”A fuzzy orange sock sailed through the air and clocked him between the eyes. Tony caught it as it fell, and couldn’t help the twitch in his lips threatening a smile. On the nose. Who knew Romanov could be funny? He hadn't even seen her arm move out of her blanket burrito.With sock in hand, Tony all but threw himself onto the sofa with his teammate, making Natasha bounce, still wrapped up in her blanket. “Can we watch Casino Royale after this?”Natasha scoffed, eyes already back on the TV. Tony copied her, smiling at the screen. One minute he was watching Tatiana Romanova seduce the famous British secret agent, and the next he was waking up with his head on a folded green blanket. He was too busy smiling down at the orange sock still in his hand to remember to ask about the workshop.  “Ohmygod,” Tony abruptly switched direction from the kitchen, clutching an empty mug. “Shh,” Natasha hissed, eyes glued on the screen. “That’s True Lies,” Tony flapped a hand.“Be quiet.”He didn't take his eyes from the screen as he scrambled over the back of the sofa, nearly braining Natasha with a flailing foot. She just grabbed his ankle with a sigh and shoved him away to the other end of the sofa. Feeling brave - or stupidly tired - Tony tugged at the edge of her blanket. His feet always got cold. Natasha only pulled it tighter around herself, making him pout, but she didn't threaten to kill him or anything, so Tony thought he was growing on her. She’d even said something almost complimentary about his performance on their last Avengers mission.“C’mon, Romanov! Sharing is caring.”“Get your own.”Too tired to dig out another blanket, and not wanting to go and risk coming back to find Natasha had disappeared on him, Tony curled around his empty coffee mug in the corner of the sofa and returned to watching the TV.“Do you do that when you're talking to someone?” Tony asked. “Imagine how you’d kill them in that moment?”“Only when they annoy me.”“Have you done that with me?”Natasha’s lips curled the smallest bit.“Could you kill me like that?”  There never seemed to be anyone else who watched a movie with Natasha. Other than Tony. Unless he was missing other movies. He wouldn't put it past her to watch movies separately with the individuals on the team, gauge their reactions, read a little more into them. It was Natasha though, her secret agendas had secret agendas. JARVIS said otherwise though, and Tony was aware that he’d become increasingly paranoid over the past few
