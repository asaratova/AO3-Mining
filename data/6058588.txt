Chapter Text

  Bruce 
 You were one of SHIELD’s greatest scientist for the unknown. You had gotten into the field of work because you craved more knowledge and you had a…quirk of your own. You were drafted to help with research on the hellcarrier with one Tony Stark and one Dr. Bruce Banner. Now Tony was someone you already heard of due to him being the one and only playboy billionaire philanthropist with a bit of genius thrown in. It was hard to find someone who didn't know who he was. Anyways, on your first day of work you walked to the lab and took a look around. Tony was there and poking another brunette man with what looked to be a mini stick. You cleared your throat and both sets of eyes turned to you. “Hello beautiful.” Tony said while moving around and coming to stand in front of you. You held out your hand to introduce yourself. “My name is (f/n) (l/n) and I'm here to help with a certain scepter.” He shook your outstretched hand and kissed it to your surprise. “Of course. Hey, what moisturizer do you use because your skin looks amazing?” A blush came to your face at his compliment. A voice startled you. “Leave the woman alone Tony.” You looked to see the brunette, Dr. Banner, coming towards you with a disapproving look towards his partner. He held his hand out to you with a small smile. You were immediately taken by it. “I'm Bruce.” It was freaking you out how you couldn't look away. You gave him a smile in return. “(f/n).” As soon as you put your hand in his your hand turned blue as his turned green. Both of you jumped away from each other while looking with shock at the other. That was the beginning of something great.Bucky “Soldier (l/n)! Front and center now!” You wasted no time in getting to him as quickly as you could. Making him wait only made him angrier. He was probably calling you to punish you for speaking out about the soldier they were experimenting on. You thought it was cruel for them to put anyone through what you had to go through before. Yes, you were once a Hydra experiment as well but you were the only one who had survived. Now you were Hydra’s most prized possession. “Yes sir?” You asked while standing still and looking at the ground. It was considered disrespectful to look them in the eye. To them you were under them. “The Winter Soldier is completed. Take it around and tell it the rules. Dismissed.” You nodded and waited until his feet disappeared before looking up. Surprise flooded you form when you saw a metal arm. What happened to him? Was the only thought you could form. You looked into his eyes and saw nothing. He was a puppet with strings. At least they had let you out of your strings early, he had no such luck. He must have been a lot of trouble. You made sure no one was looking before stepping a bit closer to him. “What is your name?” You whispered. He looked confused for a moment before the mask was back in place. What he whispered was what made you start your escape plans. “I don't know ma'am.”Clint “Get down!” You yelled at your best friend, Natasha, as a man was aiming a gun at her head. She did so without any hesitation and narrowly avoided a bullet. You aimed your gun at the man and shot with no remorse. He tried to kill her so you didn't really care. She gave you a nod in thanks and continued with her part of the mission. It started off as a stealth mission into the Hydra base before you made a rookie mistake and caused all of them to come out guns ablazing. Now you were both waiting for your backup to come get you. You had already hacked in and got the info but you were still stuck. As you threw a man over your shoulder, the sound of a jet could be heard. Finally. You thought as you pushed the pressure point in your attacker’s neck. He slumped to the floor and you continued on to the next. “You ladies look like you can use some help.” An unfamiliar voice called through the comms. “No shit Sherlock.” You panted as exhaustion started to take over. There was a chuckle before three arrows were shot around the area. Heavy smoke surrounded the area. You felt a rope hit your arm and you grabbed on. “Ready?” Both of you have the affirmative and you were hoisted up and away. As soon as you were on the jet, you laid out over one of the seats and groaned. “You good Nat?” You asked. She laughed but nodded. “You don't look all that well though.” She said while looking you over. You waved a hand. You had recovered from much worse. “I beg to differ.” Your eyes strayed up and you saw a man looking you over with a small smirk. Your eyes narrowed at him before a sneer made its way to your face. “Who the fu-“ Natasha cut you off. “(f/n) this is Agent Barton; the one I was telling you about.” Your eyes widened and you shot him an apologetic smile. “My bad hotshot. Nice to finally meet you. I'm (f/n). None of that Agent crap.” You didn't know it but Clint was smitten after that moment.Natasha You were SHIELD’s secret weapon. Your ability was a value
