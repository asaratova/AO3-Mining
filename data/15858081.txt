Chapter Text
Tony didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.Laugh because they had actually gone to Japan for the express effort of trying this. Cry because they clearly thought it would work. Sure, they were both billionaires with their names stamped on a Fortune 500 company and they’d both been child prodigies. They both pulled out of the arms race in favour of technology – albeit of different kinds – and there was a partnership in place between their two companies. But that was where the similarities ended.Tony Stark and Seto Kaiba were very different men.‘You’re kidding.’ Rhodey had met Kaiba, and he knew as well as Tony did how stupid their supposed plan really was.‘I wish!’ Tony tipped his head back.‘They thought Seto Kaiba would bankroll them?’ Pepper sat on his other side, smirking as she reiterated this. ‘Mr. I-have-an-intense-disdain-for-every-human-being-I-meet-and-I’m-not-shy-about-it?’‘Yup.’ Tony shrugged. ‘I guess Steve really doesn’t realise that other countries don’t consider him the be-all-end-all of superheroes. Hell! Kaiba doesn’t even believe in heroes. That was going to be a disaster waiting to happen.’ He tapped his chin. ‘I do wonder, though, how Kaiba managed to overcome Maximoff’s powers.’‘Maybe he doesn’t have any fears for her to exploit,’ Rhodey suggested.Pepper shook her head. ‘According to the report, Wanda had a nervous breakdown when she tried to hit Kaiba. I suppose there must have been something in his head that was too horrific for her to deal with.’‘Hm.’ Tony nodded his head. ‘Well, there was that period when he was sixteen where Kaiba got involved in a bunch of hush-hush ordeals that no one talks about.’ He huffed.
‘Anyway, Kaiba put another collar on Wanda, far worse than the one she had before.’‘Really?’ Rhodey asked. ‘I thought it was the same one. It looks just the same.’Tony shook his head. ‘The other collar just suppressed her powers. This one fires it right back at her. Whatever she’s trying to do, she’ll get hit with instead.’‘Ouch.’ Rhodey sighed and stood up. ‘I suppose someone actually has to pick them up, then?’‘The UN wants an enhanced involved, preferably one without an emotional attachment to any of them. They’re sending in Carol Danvers.’Rhodey grinned. ‘Danvers? God, I haven’t seen her in ages.’‘I’m not surprised,’ Tony said. ‘She’s been off-world.’***UN Embassy, 3 Weeks Later
Steve sat in the cell.Once again, he tried to cuffs. Not only did he not get anywhere with them, but he swore he strained his wrists from trying. The whole lot of them – him, Sam, Wanda, Clint, Natasha, and Scott – sat in these cells, waiting for...what, Steve didn’t know. They would probably be held here and then eventually disappeared. Already, these people were making Wanda suffer. Anytime she tried to use her power, she ended up screaming on the floor at the very worst.That collar had to come off!The door suddenly opened and the blonde woman – Danvers – walked in with someone Steve wasn’t expecting: Rhodey.Steve stood up. He heard the movements of some of the others. ‘Rhodey, what—’Rhodey cut him off. ‘That’s Col. Rhodes to you, Rogers.’ Rhodey then sat down in one of the chairs in front of their half-circle of cells. ‘I just wanted to know why the hell you went to Seto Kaiba, of all people. Did you seriously think he’d be sympathetic towards you?’Danvers snorted, as if the idea was amusing.Actually, yes. That was what they’d been thinking.‘He’s just like Tony,’ Natasha had said, ‘except he doesn’t run around playing hero, and he’s got a little brother he’s always looked after.’In Steve’s opinion, that’d made him better than Tony.But Kaiba hadn’t even spared them a consideration. He’d ignored all their calls and messages, and then, when they went into his office building and made their way up to his office, they’d found him in the lobby about half-way up. He’d sneered and scoffed at them. When Wanda had tried to get into his mind, she’d collapsed into a frightened, incognizant heap. Then Kaiba had hit them with some sort of wave from devices planted all over the room. Next thing Steve knew, he and the others were in a cell.Natasha spoke up. ‘What are you doing here, Rhodes?’‘I just told you,’ Rhodey said. ‘Because everyone knows that Kaiba doesn’t care about anything that doesn’t directly benefit him. Most of Tony’s business deals with him are based on that.’‘So Stark had something to do with this?’ Clint spat.Danvers snorted. ‘Really? That’s the conclusion you draw? They’re business partners so they must be friends and they must have conspired to do this? Don’t be stupid. Kaiba doesn’t have friends. There are some people Kaiba hates less, but he hates everybody. Tony and Kaiba respect each other professionally but they wouldn’t choose to spend their free time together. Kaiba, as I said before, hates everybody – including Tony. And he thinks Tony is soft.
