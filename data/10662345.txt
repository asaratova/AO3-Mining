Chapter 1: Dragons, Gods, and Relics oh my!
    




Chapter Text
Anthony Edward Stark was well known throughout the world. Son of Howard and Maria Stark. He was a billionaire, a well-known playboy though in reality he couldn’t stand having meaningless one night stands, and above everything else he was known as a disgrace to his own kind. Howard Stark had been well known to be of the powerful dragon clan. Maria Stark was known to be an everyday vanilla human. Dragons were a top tier species, they weren’t meant to breed with low tiers. Humans were low tier and while they were the lowest of the low tier Howard had still married and produced his only heir with said low tier. No one understood it. As far as the dragon community was considered he was beneath them. As far as mid-tier were concerned he was their shot at beating a dragon. To defeat someone of a higher tier could earn someone fame in mere minutes.
The other fact that added to his disgrace in the eyes of the world was he held no features of his dragon father. He looked like an everyday vanilla human. He was often a topic of debate among many groups as many wondered if he was in fact Howard Stark’s son. Maybe Maria had cheated and these rumors almost always had his blood boiling.
Only he knew the truth, of the secrets both his parents hid from the world. It almost always had him laughing because if only the world knew what kind of being he was. His mother hadn’t been human and his father, well his father was a mix of everything wrong.
The number of assassination attempts on his life were ridiculous. So many wanted to claim glory and his fortune by defeating him. Midgard laws would probably be considered odd by other realm’s standards not that the other realms actually knew the truth of what Midgard and its so called mortals were like. The other realms still thought that Midgard was barbaric and filled with lowly little mortals that were weak.
It was Midgard’s magic that kept those like Heimdal of the gods from seeing the truth. Midgrd and its people didn’t want problems with other realms. Not with the types of wars they brought with the bragging rights the gods practically waved around for all the nine realms to see.
So Midgard laws stated those of a lower tier could challenge those of a higher tier for fame or riches but they could not target someone of the same tier or lower. Such challenges were considered illegal. For top tier things were a bit different. Challenges for personal items and riches couldn’t be denied while those for business reasons had to match certain requirements. Business rivals often took advantage of those laws to gain advantages in their companies. Tony couldn’t count the number of times Justin Hammer had challenged him or had negotiated for someone else to challenge him for the coward.
Justin Hammer of course was a top tier but he was a low-level of the top tier. He was an Incubus which was a weak type of demon. He often thought he was better than Tony simply because everyone believed his mother to be human and the lack of ever showing the features of his heritage made many believe him to be simply human. If it was true top tiers wouldn’t be able to target him for such challenges but no one ever thought to consider that.
Tony had been content to simply run his company and live without the usual thrills top tiers sought but after being betrayed by his business partner Obadiah he had decided on a new path. Afghanistan had not ended the way Obadiah had hoped and when he returned alive and uninjured from the Ten Rings and he discovered the dragon’s betrayal he’d openly challenged him. It was the first one he’d ever made and he swore it would be his last.
Obadiah had laughed and accepted thinking he was weak due to human blood. Tony had killed him in the challenge to the death for the wrongful attempt on his life. Obadiah had used cheating and mid tiers to try and kill him and that went against their laws. The world who had been uncertain of Tony’s strength had looked at the bloody mess of his once business partner. Not once during the fight did he call forth the features of his heritage.
Many would think people would realize not to challenge him, the attempts and challenges increased after that. The number of suitors also increased. Tony had no desire for a mate which the world had found odd considering dragons were known to take hordes of mates. Tony had always looked on with disgust at dragons taking so many mates simply to prove their superiority with a large horde. Normally they were mid to low tier which meant their life span was a lot shorter than their own but still, Tony didn’t want a horde or something false that wouldn’t last. He was sentimental while most dragons cherished their hordes of mates much like they treasured their hordes of riches.
So Tony Stark was odd and he added to the list of odd when he became iron man. Contrary to popular belief just because someone has strength to fight doesn’t mean they do. Top tiers
