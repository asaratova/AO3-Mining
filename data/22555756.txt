Chapter Text
Wednesday      Stiles took another breath and concentrated on trying to hold back the sense of doomed panic that had been constant for the last year since the nogitsune. He let his breath out slowly. It didn’t really help. Nothing did, but maybe it helped a little. He kept at it at any rate. He was just preparing to take another breath when the doorbell rang, and he jerked and rolled off the couch onto the floor.         “Ow fuck,” he said heatedly, and pulled himself back up and staggered to the door. He glanced through the peephole to see a man in a suit wearing glasses. He opened the door cautiously. “Yes?”          “Stiles Stilinski?” the man asked politely.          “Yes.”         “I’m agent Coulson of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division, do you have a moment I can come in and talk to you?”          “Are you sure you’re not looking for my dad, he’s the sheriff.”           “I know who your dad is, Mr Stilinski. I’m here to see you.”          “Is this about the FBI program? Because I just sent in that packet.”          “No. I’m here on a private and highly confidential matter. Can I please come in?”          Stiles hesitated for a moment before opening the door. “Come in I guess.” He pulled out his phone and shot his dad a quick text with the agent’s name and affiliation. He wasn’t sure what this was about, but if something went wrong he wanted his dad to know where to start looking.         He led the agent to the dining room and offered him a drink which he declined. After they sat down he just looked at the agent before finally saying, “So how can I help you?”          “First I want to make sure you understand that what we’re about to talk about is extremely sensitive. I wouldn’t be here if circumstances were any different.”          “Okay. Well, I guess I can keep a secret.”          “I hope so.” Agent Coulson looked at him for a moment then said, “About a week ago Tony Stark went missing somewhere over North Dakota.”           Stiles blinked and narrowed his eyes. “Okay?”            “Ms Potts was with him.”            Stiles gave the agent a blank look. “That’s terrible. I hope you find them?” Stiles gave a half shrug, “I’m not sure what this has to do with me?”          The agent gave him a fixed stare.         Stiles stared back. He was just opening his mouth when two things happened. First, he heard the house phone ring, a sound he hadn’t actually heard in a week. Second, he heard his dad's cruiser pull into the yard.         “Hold on,” he said to the agent, and went into the kitchen to answer the phone. “Hello?” hesaid.          “Stiles!” his dad said.          “Dad, I just heard your car,” he started moving toward the window. “What’s-“          “Hold on, I’m coming in,” his dad said, and hung up. Before he even got the phone back on the hook, his dad was coming through the door.          “Hey dad, this is agent Coulson with the Supreme Headquarters something or other. Agent Coulson, Sheriff Stilinski.”         “Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division,” the agent said, “and it’s nice to meet you sheriff, I think you met my boss, Director Fury, a few years ago.”         “I did. Back when Claudia was still alive.”         “My condolences.”         “Thank you. Do you mind if I ask why you’re here? Has something come up?”         “As I was just telling Stiles, last Monday Tony Stark and Ms Potts went missing somewhere over North Dakota. The jet disappeared from radar and Mr Stark's AI lost contact at the same time, but no wreckage has been found. There’s been perimeter security on your family ever since, but no unusual activity has been observed.”          “Can we go back to I’m not really sure what’s going on here?”          Agent Coulson looked at Stiles and then his dad. “He doesn’t know?”          “No, when Claudia died the decision was made by SHIELD and Stark to wait til he was 18.”          “That wasn’t in my notes.”         “I’m pretty sure it was mostly Claudia and Stark actually who made the decision.”         “What decision?” Stiles asked, his anxiety spiking.         His dad looked at him, the worry obvious in his eyes, and the set of his shoulders. “Son, your mom was Howard Stark's daughter.”          Stiles slumped back down into the chair. “Wait, so gramms like-?”          “She met Howard before your gramps Stiles. After she met your grandfather, she stopped seeing Howard, but things had already happened. Well your mom had already happened.”          “And so he’s here because Tony is missing, and we’re like his next of kin?”          “Stiles,” Agent Coulson said, “You're the heir to Stark Industries if Tony doesn’t reappear. Which wouldn’t be SHIELD’s concern, except Tony Stark is also-“          “Iron Man. Though really it should be Gold Titanium Alloy Man,” Stiles grumbled.           “-Iron Man,” Coulson finished.
