Chapter Text
Notes:
Hey there are not enough of these Fanfictions out there so I decided to write my own movie fic. There was one that I really liked but can't remember the name of because it got deleted but I hope you enjoy this. Have a lot of stories in the mix to be moved over from another site so bear with me.

Also Bold is for the movie scenes and the author(Me) speaking to everyone. I promise it will make sense.
Â Tony Stark sighed as he put his phone down. It was another phone call from Happy to complain about the kid, who has sent so many texts and voicemails Happy put him on mute.It has been a little over a month since Germany and Tony did feel a little bad for using the kid as a weapon to help him but he knew he was the one who was right. He was so excited, the kid reminded him of himself now that he thought of it. But right now the kid was not needed so he pushed any thoughts of him to the back of his mind. He heard what the kid said in the bedroom when he first came to recruit Peter to fight for him, if he knew what was really going on Tony feared he would have helped Cap instead of him.No he was right. Right? No he was, I need to stop thinking like that, He thought.He let out another sigh as he looked down at his work, an overly complicated plan to prove to Pepper he should have another chance. It was like 109 steps but it was going to be worth it to be with her again. He took a long sip from his black coffee that was long cold by now, and grimiest a little.However when Tony was reaching to the hologram to fix something there was a shrill beep that lasted a few seconds. He froze and waited with bated breath, then suddenly a voice rang out that nearly sent him flying out of his chair.
"Tony Stark brace yourself, you will be teleported in 3 seconds."
Tony's eyes widened and reached for the nearest gauntlet but there was a blinding flash before he could grab it, and all that was left was an empty lab with a mug of coffee spilling on the floor."Ow get your knee out of my face!""That's my elbow genius!"Darkness and a monstrous headache that was a lot worse than any hangover he ever had. Slowly Tony came to only to find himself in a tangle of limbs. He struggled briefly before he was able to pull himself free of the mass of people.He stumbled before straightening himself and looked up to find the face of Steve Rogers."You!" Tony snarled. By this point everyone had gotten up and was staring at them."Tony," Steve tried to pacify him, but Stark would have none of it, but before he could jump at Captain Spangles Natasha, who was also there, stopped him."Now is not the time Tony, we need to figure out where we all are.""Yeah if the FBI finds out I'm out of the house I'm screwed!" A new voice said and Tony turned around to find that Ant-Man guy."Oh really that's your top priority, not saying sorry for taking our tech to Germany!" Tony turned again to see Hope Van-Dyne glaring daggers at the Ant dude person.Tony did a full 360 to see everyone who was in the room. It was him, Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, the Ant guy, Hope Van-Dyne, Sam, Clint, Thor, Bruce, King T'Challa, a younger teenager that looked like T'Challa, Wanda, Vision, The Winter Soldier, and Nick Fury at first glance.Tony glared daggers at The Winter Soldier, but his brain backtracked, "Banner!" He called out shocked. Everyone turned in the direction he was looking to see Bruce. Natasha was stunned into silence.He started to make his way toward him but stopped at the sight of Thor, "The hell happened to you!" He called out shocked again as everyone looked to Thor and took in his short hair and missing eye."Much Man of Iron." Thor answered, "It is good to see you all my friends, and Captain you have copied my beard!" Everyone looked back and forth comparing beards, "Where are we, friend Stark is this your doing?" He asked."No Point Break this was not me there was a shill beeping followed by a voice saying I was being teleported here in 3 seconds.""The same thing happened to me and my sister." T'Challa pointed out, "I can guess the same happened to everyone of you as well?" Everyone nodded their heads."Why are we here?" Fury questioned/demanded."Beats me man." A new voice rang out. Everyone turned at the new voice and saw an unfamiliar man with a little scruff and a weird get up. Then to the surprise of everyone a greened skinned women with a Natasha level glare expression looked around until she saw us and glared even harder, followed by a gray skinned alien man with red tattoos and an alien girl with antenna who also got up and looked around in confusion."Quill, where are we, and who are these ugly lifeforms that resemble you?" The gray skinned one asked.Well we were all offended but before the shouts of outrage could start the guy Quill said, "I don't know Drax, but they are not that ugly."Well that was much better, Tony thought dryly."There prettier than you Quill." a voice similar to Bradly Cooper rang out. We turned an
