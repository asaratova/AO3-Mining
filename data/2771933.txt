Chapter One: Born of Darkness. 
The young emerald eyed sorcerer made his way with his party to a temple. The temple looked out something like a horror movie where sacrifices of virgins would be made to appease a god. The emerald eyed sorcerer didn't have to worry because none of his group were virgins. That was something that he personally made sure of many times over.The warm flickers of the warm embers greeted the group outside of the temple. Today was the day that they would arrive. Time was an interesting and mysterious thing. It had to happen on this day because it already happened.He didn't even want to wrap his head around the craziness of time travel theories. All it would be bound to do was to make his head explode into a pile of ick. The green eyed wizard shook his head.The four females that followed him would follow him to the ends of the Earth. Now they would follow him to a different place, they would follow him to the edge of time."So, she said that she would meet you here at the right time, right?"The brunette girl was the first one who spoke up. She wore a tight black shirt that wrapped around her teenage curves. The eighteen year old girl put her hands on her hips, covered in tight black pants. She had a belt with a blade that this young man taught her to use.This young man was Harry Potter. He wore many faces to the world. He was a mutant. He was a magician. He was also an alien. He was a businessman and a teacher that taught many super powered females how to use their abilities.He could do it all, or so it seemed. The only things he couldn't do were the things that he didn't try. The only women that he couldn't do were the one's that he never had the pleasure of meeting."She did tell us to meet her here, yes, on this night, as midnight approaches," Harry said."As midnight approaches, no that's not foreboding at all, is it?" the brunette asked, shaking her head with a shudder."You're not scared, are you, Kitty?" one of the blondes in the group said to her.The blonde was dressed in a black jacket, along with a red shirt, and a tight pair of black pants that fit around her frame snugly. Her most defining feature though was the black headband that rested on the top of her head. Her name was Gwen Stacy, one of Harry's oldest female friends and one of his many girlfriends. She was the smartest girl of her age.She also had gifts but those didn't matter right now."I'm not scared," Kitty Pryde, better known as Shadowcat, said. She shook her head. The girl's ability to maintain intangibility allowed her to get into places that were only among the wildest dreams of anyone else."I don't think none of us are scared," the second blonde said. She wore a tight black shirt with a silver "S" shield on it. The leather black skirt and boots added to the outfit. The final article of clothing was black and grey jacket that could be folded out to be a cape if she thought it. "We just want to be extremely cautious, that's all.""Thanks, Kara," Harry said.Kara Zor-El had been with him here since the beginning. They met when Harry was twelve and she was eleven. Kara went through the portal in her mother's lab and ran into Harry, when he had bars on his windows. She rescued them and scared the shit out of his relatives. She was his first friend and they had become much more. Kara couldn't return home because she got stranded by Earth and her planet might have died by the time she got back because it was in bad shape.The two of them made their way to this world after an adventure in the aptly named Department of Mysteries."Cautious, isn't that the name of your game?" the fifth and final member of their party asked them.The girl's red hair bounced brightly, almost burning bright in the eerie moonlight. Her green eyes looked like Harry's at first sight but were a different shade. She wore a red robe with a golden Phoenix emblem on it. Kara and Harry appeared pretty much on top of her head when they arrived. Jean Grey had a freak out because of her Phoenix powers.She may have played no small part in dragging them here but it was really a combination of many things."It's always my name, Jean," Harry said to one of his mates, wrapping his arm around her. "It's not like I don't trust Selene butâ€¦.""This hasn't been done before, we know that," Jean said, it was almost like she was reading his mind. "At least not to the extent we're doing it."She might have been able to if it was anyone else other than Harry. Since it was Harry, she couldn't read his mind. That made her relationship with him a challenge and she liked a challenge. She wanted someone that she could have fun with.The fact that there were so many girls, she didn't mind it at all. It showed Harry's power and strength.They walked into the temple. The clock nearly reached midnight; it was a few minutes away. A large statue of Harry could be seen at the end of the corridor."Welcome," a soft voice said. "Beloved, welco
