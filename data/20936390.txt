-BUCKY-
 
He was really starting to hate him.
By him, Bucky meant Clint who was perched on the arm of the couch, Wii remote in hand, in the middle of a very heated game of Super Smash Bros.
Now, on its own, that wouldn't bother him. It was the fact that the archer was whooping and hollering at every bit of damage dealt. Weather he was on the dealing or receiving end. Sam wasn't much help, either. Grumbling and cursing things under his breath that Steve would not approve of as he neared his last life.
It was just something about two grown men, both one of 'Earths Mightiest Hero's', making a greatly audible deal over a game targeted for 5-year old. He begrudgingly sat through the girlish shrieks of Clint and the furious button mashing of Sam slightly on edge from all the irritating noise, finally losing it when the blonde proceeded to jump up in excitement after successfully knocking him off the floating platform.
  Slamming his hands against the counter top, his metal arm making a jolting 'smack' against the granite.
"That's it, Barton!" he barked over the sounds of Clint's celebratory shouts, instantly putting stop to the other man's victory and gaining the attention of everyone else in the room.
All the Avengers (sans Tony who was off in his workshop and Thor who was off world) eyed him expectantly, waiting for him to wring someone's (probably Clint's) neck.
"If you don't stop screaming and carrying on like a toddler," he spat. "I will personally rip that television of the wall and put it through the window!"
There was a pause. Then, Clint slumped back down into his spot on the armrest, pouting. 
"Fine, Terminator. No need to go all 'commando' on my ass." At this, Steve, leaning against the wall, let out a small chuckle. Bucky heard, angrily turning his gaze towards the captain, shooting icy daggers his way.
"I can't believe you actually find this funny Mr. "Star-Spangled-Man-With-A-Plan." Steve immediately grew red at the mention of his, ahem, 'past occupation'. Sheepishly hiding behind the sketchbook he was working on. 
"I can't believe you still call it a Television." snarked Rhodey from behind the kitchen sink, rinsing off a plum. he simply rolled his eyes at his backhanded jab. Just then, Natalia Natasha came up behind the War Machine, skillfully swiping the plum from his grasp before casually leaning back against the counter. 
"Don't hassle the old man." she retorted, smirking at Bucky who in return, flashed her a mocking grin.
"Don't look at me!" the spy continued. "It's your own fault. You've been here long enough to have been expected to have dropped the vintage vocabulary."
 Rhodey tried to make a grab for the fruit, but she simply tossed it across the room with deadly aim to Wanda who sat cuddled up with Vision in the loveseat with what appeared to be one of the Harry Potter books in her lap.
However, before the plum could hit its intended target, the girl effortlessly lifted her free hand, stretching her fingers as a scarlet aura engulfed the fruit, stopping it in its tracks. for a second, she didn't look up, seemingly finishing the paragraph she was reading. Then, she lay the open-faced book down in her lap, turning her attention to the suspended fruit.
"But that's what it's called, isn't it?" she said, maneuvering her fingers as the same scarlet magic spindled around them, causing the fruit to turn slowly midair. "a television?" 
"Oh, god. There's two of them!" Clint squawked from the couch as he set himself up for another round against Sam, taking his sweet time choosing his brawler much to the annoyance of Wilson.
 "Ha-ha." Wanda huffed flatly. Flicking her wrist, she sent the plum sailing across the room, magic dissipating around it leaving it just a normal fruit. Natasha raised her hand above her head, preparing to catch the make-shift baseball.
 But Bucky was already on the move, quickly snatching the plum out of the air and looking Nat in the eyes, bit into the flesh of the fruit.
"You're no fun, you know that Barnes?" she scoffed, her steely tone laced with amusement.
"I'm an old man." he recited. "I'm not supposed to be fun." Taking another bite of the plum, Bucky watched as Rhodey's face fell.
"That was my plum..." he murmured dejectedly. Natasha snorted and Steve let out barking laugh, deep and satisfying. He was forced to set his sketchbook down on a nearby window sill due to him practically splitting his sides. Bucky cracked a grin at his friends exaugurated reaction (and if he dared, would even call him a drama queen).
 Then, alerting him to his existence, Bruce looked up from his swirling cup of coffee and miscellaneous papers scattered across the table, risking a shy grin, shaking his head.
"You guys are so immature." His voice loud and exasperated for his pessimistic demeaner. If there was anyone who wasn't laughing by then, they sure as hell were
