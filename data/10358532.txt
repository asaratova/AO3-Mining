Chapter 1: Dan doesn't suck, but Black Widow is still cooler
    




Chapter Text
Dan Espinoza was a dirty cop with morals. He thrived under the hierarchical structure of the Los Angeles police department even when some of its members engaged in questionable practices. He was loyal to a fault, he protected people, he had initiative, he kept his mouth shut, he was willing to jump into a fight, and he didn’t question the how’s or why’s as long as he got the job done. In short, Dan Espinoza was a perfect recruit for S.H.I.E.L.D. Even after the Malcolm debacle, Dan continued to cut corners in his police work. He changed names on police reports, disappeared evidence, looked away when his co-workers accepted bribes, trespassed without a warrant, threatened suspects, and even set the Russian mob on a certain Warden. Everything was done in the name of justice. Despite all of his failings, at his core, Detective Espinoza believed in right vs. wrong. However, inevitably, accounting and internal affairs caught on that something wasn’t adding up and just like that, he was out. After the slap on the wrist Dan received for taking a gun out of evidence that was used in a murder by a dirtier cop, his superiors didn’t want the P.R. nightmare of explaining why Dan was allowed to remain a police officer after multiple offenses. He was quietly let go and out on the street with no badge or gun before any of his co-workers noticed.Dan had stood frozen outside the police precinct holding a cardboard box with his few meager personal items. The bottom of the world had fallen out. He didn’t know how to be anything other than a cop. He pictured the endless stretch of days that lay out in front of him as meaningless and worthless as he was. And, oh god, what would he tell Chloe and Trixie?Then a man in a suit approached him, and before he knew it, Dan was being shuttled to a secret training facility to learn how to fire assault rifles, stand unassumingly in a corner, and not question or speak about the strange and terrifying things that passed by him. It felt like being saved. It was humbling and crushing in a way that only someone like him, who secretly believed he had already used up all of his chances, could understand.The secret agent life suited Dan. For the first time he felt like he was truly able to help people without being trapped by red-tape. Dan believed in the cause. He trusted in his new superiors when they said that everything he did was for the greater good, even when he had no idea what was going on or how to pronounce the weapons and equipment he was protecting. L.A. taught him the world was strange and only getting stranger. He was glad the good guys were finally getting ahead. The file S.H.I.E.L.D kept on Daniel Espinoza listed him as an adequate low level security officer. His work was consistent, all of his aptitude tests were well in the acceptable ranges, he followed orders diligently and he got along with even the most eccentric scientist or field agent. He was loyal and had a lack of curiosity that suited the work well. He was a good agent, but there was nothing special about him. Daniel Espinoza was your average every-day employee of S.H.I.E.L.D. He didn’t make waves. It was expected that if he continued to perform at the same level that he would be able to lead his own team in five years or so. Most people would walk right by the corridor he was standing at attention in or look passed him as he guarded an unmarked crate in transit.    The only noteworthy entry on Dan’s file occurred during a mission while he was escorting a foreign dignitary who had a pretty secretary by the name of Natalie Rushman.----The mission had been routine. Dan had been with S.H.I.E.L.D. for a little over ten months. On his prior missions, he usually found himself one of a hoard of nameless suit wearing agents entering a building, swarming over a crime scene, or generally being part of a large intimidating show of force. He had only needed to draw his weapon five times. Dan had the funny suspicion some higher level agent thought it was “cool” to see dozens of identically dressed agents walking around no matter how inappropriate suits were in the climate they found themselves in.  On this mission, he was one of eight security officers assigned to protect a rather over-weight foreign dignitary who had a thick English accent and spent most of his time drinking, eating and ogling Ms. Rushman. To her credit, Ms. Rushman smiled and giggled at any inappropriate comments the dignitary belched out while keeping him on task and following the timetable. It was apparently vital that this piggish man appear at some peace talks in a country Dan had never heard of for some war that Dan was pretty sure normal citizens in America didn’t know existed. At Dan’s clearance level, questions were not encouraged, and honestly, Dan didn’t want to know. He was there to do a job, and if he had to put up with this gross specimen of a human being then, well, Da
