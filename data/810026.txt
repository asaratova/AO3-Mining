Chapter 1





Chapter Text
The biggest downside of working for a terrorist group is that there’s a ton of them out there. Everybody’s moving, angling for themselves, their own interests, and sometimes it’s hard to tell who’s on your side and who’s not. As a sniper, Clint likes to be shown a target and shoot it. He can’t get his head around all the inner workings of the organization, all the lies and espionage. Natasha’s good at that, good at seeing through people and working them to get her own way. But she’s been in Russia for the last two months, and Clint has been on his own.                And, apparently, Clint hasn’t been doing so well.                It all started out fine. He’d been sent with another agent into the field. Deep cover assassination. Only, they’d gotten into the field, met up with the target, and the other agent had promptly handed him over to the assholes running rival organization. The other terrorist cell wanted information from Clint, wanted him to spill the whereabouts of the other operatives.                Which Clint would have been fine with.  Other than Natasha, Clint didn’t have emotional attachments to any of the other people in his organization. As a matter of fact, he pretty much thought they were all jackasses. Not that this new organization seemed much better (was there really a comparison between jackasses and assholes? Clint thought it was pretty much splitting hairs at this point) but they didn’t have a supply of biology suppressants for him. Not the black market, high end suppressant he needed, anyway.                Clint was a badass. He was an assassin, a killer, a terrorist, and an archer. But he was also an omega. And as long as his organization kept control of the suppressants that kept him from going in to heat, he’d keep doing whatever they asked. No matter how distasteful he found it, or how little of his soul was left at the end.                Because the alternative was too horrifying to contemplate.                It took about a week for his suppressants to start wearing off, for the nausea and fever to begin. Clint knew, realistically, that he had another three weeks before the true heat hit, but the first waves always terrified him almost as much as the heat itself. Contemplating how bad it could get was almost as bad as going through it.                Clint was pretty confident that his group would come for him. They’d only let him hit his heat before once, and then he’d been stranded in the arctic and, as much as it sucked, he really couldn’t blame them for that one. Plus, it had only been one day of excruciating, hellish nightmare. There was no way they’d let him go into heat  with these fucks.                Unless, of course, these fucks managed to get their hands on experimental, highly illegal heat-inducing drugs. He’d fought them, of course. Fought like they were trying to peel his skin off when they gave him the injection, but even Hawkeye isn’t big enough to take out eight brawny alphas at the same time.Not without his bow, anyway.                They’d thrown him back in a cell after that, and fuck if Clint knew who was the smartass that had leaked that he was an omega, but they were gonna pay! That thought, and that thought alone, pretty much occupied his mind and kept the, “Oh shit, Oh shit,” at bay.                So when the raid came, with a half dozen SHEILD agents that had no clue what the hell they were doing, it was at least a welcome distraction, even if it didn’t improve his odds of surviving by much.  At least he’d die at the end of a gun, instead of letting his heat torture him to death.                Clint probably didn’t look like much of a threat when they found him panting in the back corner of one of the cells. His hands had been zip-tied together, and he hadn’t even managed to wiggle out of them. The effects of the heat had already started, the early nausea and stomach cramping, the headache and the fever. For a group of soldiers taking apart a terrorist organization, these guys were young. All in their mid-twenties, and all looking half-terrified.                “Fuck. They get you guys from the local boyscout troop or what?” Clint barked, because at least one of these kids was gonna have his head blown off in the next twenty minutes. Clint was pretty sure it wasn’t just the nausea making him sick.                “It was supposed to be a training exercise!” one of the boys blurted out, nearly hysterical.                “Wait,” Clint barked, gasping because it hurt his bruised ribs to laugh. “Are you telling me that you guys – a trainee group of SHEILD agents -  just happened to stumble into a terrorist cell? For real?”                “We’re special ops trainees,” the oldest one defended. “We’ve been specially selected for these kinds of missions.”                “Any of you seen field action?” Clint asked, and laughed again when no one answered. “Alright, help me up,” he demanded, and one of the dumb fucks actually m
