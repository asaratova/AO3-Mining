Chapter 1: Not Ned
    




Chapter Text
   Peter was out on patrol, trying to help. He didn’t want to hurt people. Why couldn’t others understand that! Not everyone is selfish and cruel. He just wanted to help. Why, just why couldn’t they see that!  He was two hours into patrol, when he found a little girl by herself crying. He helped her find her dad, but then he started blaming Spider-Man! I just wanted to help..   Peter thought sadly. He got home, and tried to get his mind of it. He decided the best way to do that would be to text Ned. He went to his phone but then remembered Ned changed his number. So he grabbed his bag and pulled out the paper, quickly entering the new one.  
 Peter 
hey Ned? Can we talk for a bit?It’s Peter, your best friend?something happened while I was out earlier, and now idk how I feel Ned?dude cmon I don’t wanna be alone right now Crap... it’s past midnight sorry I forgot you actually sleepI’ll stop texting and let you get some sleepI’m sorry~~~~~~~~   Tony was tossing and turning. He had been for hours. Stephen said he had to go to bed at eight. Eight! He was the great Tony Stark. Who was Stephen to tell him what to do. And why the hell did he listen! 
ughhhhhhh
  Tony rolled over and checked his phone. He had been laying down for over four hours! So what if he hadn’t slept in like, three days?! He decided he was allowed to at least check his phone. He unlocked it, and immediately noticed messages from a new number.  Tony read over the messages and felt bad. Poor guy. I wonder what happened. Wait why the- I’m not Ned so why am I being messaged? Tony thought to himself.”FRI? Be a dear and get whatever you can on this ‘Peter’ guy...” 
 Of course sir. It’ll take a moment. 
Tony looked back and the messages and sighed. He couldn’t just... not respond after seeing how sad “Peter” was.
 ??? 
Why are you even apologizing right now?you’re friend isn’t responding because you got the wrong number and how did you even text this number? Didn’t I put up a bunch of firewalls ?
 Peter 
You.. You’re not Ned

NopeAnd I’m pretty sure I’d know if I was So what’s the matter? What happened Peter oh well it’s not that big of a deal and I thought Ned was just practicing his coding or wanted to prank me you should upgrade those btw it was easy to get past 
 ???

 Peter

D a m n i t h e l l that’s too much effort  but don’t think I didn’t notice you  avoiding my question what happened?
 Peter 
dangwell if you must knowi just wanted to help the kid! I really just wanted to help. I helped her find her dad and he threw stuff at me, I moved a women out of the way before a car hit her and she yelled at me saying it was my fault! I just wanna help people! But no. Apparently I’m bad at that too. I’m just useless. now I just wanna make it through the day 
 ??? 
You don’t seem anywhere near old enough to worry about this stuffyou can’t help everyone, and a lot of people are ungratefulbut don’t let that stop youif you really want to help, do itso what if people say all that stuffif it’s something that you really care about doing then do it
