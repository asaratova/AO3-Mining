A/N: In case this wasn't clear from the summary: this is explicit Loki/Thor PWP.

"I'm feeling bold, Thor." Sif grinned wide and threw her hair over her shoulder. "I challenge you. I call you out. For stakes, this time."
Thor dropped Mjolnir into the dust of the practice field and put his hands on his hips, matching her smile. "What sort of stakes?""Exactly the kind you're hoping for. If you beat me, you can have me. One night, any way you want. And if I beat you… I demand the same privilege."Thor blinked. Laughed. "I would hardly consider that a forfeit…"She smirked. "You haven't heard what I want. I'm not even sure you'd be able to give it to me.""Sif!""Yes or no?""A challenge has been made. Never let it be said that Thor Odinson did not answer.""Yes, then." Her eyes glowed. "Swear it."He swore.Sif laughed, and shimmered, and faded away entirely, leaving Loki standing in her place. "Wonderful, brother. We're going to have a fantastic fight."
********************************************
Thor raged and protested, but Loki had extracted a promise and would not release him from it. Thor asked why a hundred times, and Loki found a hundred different ways of telling him that he wanted to fight, truly fight for a change, learn how he matched up to Thor's best efforts."You always go easy, in the end," he complained. "But there's no fear of that this time.""And when I win?""Then you can fuck me or let me go, as you choose." Loki shrugged. "It wouldn't be the first time I've been put on my belly for losing a fight."Thor was horrified. But before he could demand to know what had happened, who had dared, whether he still lived (because he wouldn't for much longer!), Loki licked his lips and nodded towards the hammer. "Weapons, or none?"Thor dropped it at once. "I will not fight you with that.""Then I won't use any magic. Shall we wrestle like savages, or grab a pair of swords?""Staves," Thor said through gritted teeth. "I won't risk taking your head off.""Very well. Staves." Loki flicked his wrist, and a staff materialized in his hand. It was light, small, the right size for a person of Loki's build…So Thor found one among the practice weapons that was close to the same weight."Don't be ridiculous, that's a toothpick for you." Loki nodded to the pile. "Pick a real staff. You wouldn't want me to actually win, would you? I warn you: if I do, I will fuck you like a woman and I'll make you enjoy it, too." He grinned, with no mirth. "You had better fight like you mean it, brother."Thor tried to, he truly did. But at first he pulled every blow, landing harmlessly against Loki's parries or sometimes against his braced shoulder. In return he took a savage beating, to the body, and the knees, and the head… and eventually Loki ducked under an ill-timed attack and slammed the staff end-first into his nose, breaking it immediately. "That was a warning," he said, breathless already. He was not a fighter! "The next one will knock you out, and I'll have my prize."He sounded serious, and Thor guarded himself a little more carefully. But he still made no real efforts to answer Loki's fury. Neither did he answer Loki's words, which grew progressively more crude and disgusting until he could feel his face flame. "Are you sure you won't mind walking bowlegged for a week? And I hope there's no place you have to ride." "That's pathetic; are you losing on purpose? Perhaps you want an excuse to grab your ankles." "I promise it'll be a first time worth remembering." "I'll make you say my name and tell me you love it." "Thor, I'll come on your face, and I'll make you lick it up." Complete with pantomime.Eventually Thor lashed out hard once, hoping to silence him, but though the blow clunked loudly off Loki's skull it didn't seem to make a dent in his madness. "That's more like it! Do that again; in a minute I'll start thinking you actually care about your virtue. Provided you still have it, of course. For all I know you make bets like this all the time."Thor told himself that Loki's words were just wind and didn't matter, but it was hard not to mind hearing things like: "I'll make you suck me" and "Down your throat…"They escalated past light defense-testing blows, and past blows that would bruise. Before long the blows they ducked would have cracked skulls; the ones they parried could break bones. After a time Thor realized that he was fighting full out, that he was giving no consideration to Loki's smaller size or lesser skill, and the thought gave him pause, mid-swing.Loki capitalized, blocking and smashing Thor behind the knee, sending him down. He leapt on top, stomped Thor's hand under his boot, so that his fingers crunched and the staff rolled from his grip. Kicked him once in the face, swung his staff and stopped it just before it landed. The tip rested on Thor's throat. "Do you yield?""Never," he said, and shoved at Loki with his good hand. He would get up, retri
