Chapter Text
There are many laws and rules regarding Omegas in Asgard. An abstract of its main subjects can be found in the `Regulatory overview of Agardian basic constitution´:
-	An Omega belongs to Asgard and only secondary to its Alpha.
------> The Allfather decides on the Omegas mate.
------> Prime Alphas must be favored in his decision.
- An Omega is always to obey the command of its Alpha.
- An Omega is to take care of its Alphas needs, be it in emotional, domestic or carnal devotion.
------> Is the Omega mated to a Prime Alpha, the first is to be regularly knotted and is to calm down the latter in situation demanding their soothing nature.
- An Omega is expected to carry as many children as possible – in service for Asgards glory and its Alphas honor.
- If an Omega has committed a crime, its Alpha decides on the punishment and, if required, is responsible to answer before the court of Asgard.
- A death sentence does not apply to any Omega.
------> If a felony is demanding a death sentence it shall be altered in an incarceration with regular breeding. Here any Prime-Alpha have first claim before others.
- An Omega shall not serve in the military or do heavy work.
------> Furthermore is an Omega not allowed to work if its Alpha doesn’t approve.
- The Alpha mate is to satisfy its Omega in its heat.
- An Alpha shall be treating its Omega corresponding to its soft and pliable nature.
- Killing an Omega evokes a death sentence in return.
- Omegas acquired through war are automatically gaining citizenship, if bound to an Alpha.
------> Binding an Omega to an Alpha requires for the latter to brand his chosen one on a body part, which is easily accessible for examination.
------> A bound Omega is the property of its Alpha, but also of Asgard as secondary beneficiary.
------> As property, the bound Omega status´ is below the one of a normal free citizen under Asgardian law.
- Bound Omegas can gain the position as wife if the Alpha wishes so.
Unfortunately in Asgard, the realm eternal, no Omega has been birthed in the last two thousand years. Usually mated and bred, they serve as a collum of Asier population growth and its emotional counterbalance to their major Alpha population. Struggling with the declining rate of the Omega population, the realm seeks out other ways to counteract the seemingly natural drop. But trade and alliances are proving not even partially successful as Omegas are usually kept treasured for ones own purpose by the other realms. And even the influential Asgardian Allfather has struggles to acquire a potential mate for his impulsive Alpha prime son.
