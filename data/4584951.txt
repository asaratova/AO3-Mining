Chapter 1: Karl Urban/reader
    




Chapter Text


You follow your cousin’s instructions, parking your bike just inside the warehouse with expectations of rain later in the day. He had recently hit a big break in his career, landing a job working as one of the stunt doubles for the new Star Trek movie. Knowing how hard you “geek out” over anything Star Trek related, he was gracious enough to invite you for a visit, allowing you to stay at his place – although the main reason you really came was to check out the set!
You nudge the kickstand down, allowing your bike to lean over as you kill the engine. Hearing footsteps approach, you slide your helmet off and swing your leg over the rear of the bike, bringing you face to face with your cousin.
“Hey Jack.” You throw one of your arms around his shoulders, still dangling your helmet in the other.
He wraps his arms around you, lifting you off the ground for a brief moment. “Glad you could make it! Don’t worry about leaving your helmet here; no one will mess with your stuff.”
You nod, leaving it on the seat of your bike before following Jack further into the warehouse. “So, do I get to see you working? Or can you at least tell me who it is you’re a double for already?”
He laughs, draping an arm loosely across your shoulders. “All in good time, my dear cousin. I might introduce you to some of the crew later, but for now… I wanna show you the set!”
As you round the corner, your jaw drops, and you numbly step forward onto the bridge of the USS Enterprise. “C-can I?...”
You turn to face Jack, who rolls his eyes, but reluctantly nods as a smile spreads across his face. Wasting no time, you strip off your heavy leather jacket and throw it into his waiting hands. Turning back, you take a deep breath, and step up to the captain’s chair, slowly lowering yourself to rest in what may be the most amazing seat of your life. Your heart pounds against your chest, and a massive grin remains plastered across your face as you take in the view.
“Alright.” His voice breaks through your daydream, bringing you back to reality. “Let’s go grab some lunch.”
You frown slightly, but drag yourself away from the chair, reluctantly coming to stand beside him again to take another look before leaving. You slip your jacket back on, not bothering to zip it back up as you follow Jack through the warehouse and weave through various sets.
“Come on!” He calls over his shoulder as you start to fall behind. “I promise I’ll show you everything later, but I’m starving!”
Groaning in annoyance, you trudge forward, scuffing your feet against the floor slowly. His eyes narrow, telling you your plan is working, and as he throws his hands up you know you’ve won.
“Fine! You can go look around and I’ll go get us some food, just try not to break anything or be too weird!” He’s calling after you by the end of his sentence; you had turned around almost immediately to run back to the main sets.
You soon find yourself back at the bridge, internally drooling over all the details and completely lost in your own little fantasy world. Footsteps sound nearby, and you assume they belong to your cousin again as they hesitate before coming to stand behind you.
“Pretty amazing right?” The voice startles you, definitely not belonging to your cousin.
You turn quickly, almost knocking into the man, but his hands catch your shoulders to steady you. He chuckles softly, and you feel heat rising to your cheeks as you reluctantly bring your eyes up to meet with his. Your breath catches, and you feel the blush spread further across your cheeks when he flashes that gorgeous smile.
“I’m so sorry.” You finally manage to say, backing away slightly.
He drops his hands to his sides, but seems hesitant about it, or maybe that’s just wishful thinking.
“So…” He clears his throat. “I haven’t seen you around; did J.J. just hire you on?”
Shaking your head softly, you open your mouth to speak, but are interrupted. “Hey! There you are, I was looking everywhere!” Jack’s voice sounds from the doorway, and he comes to stand beside you before turning his gaze. “I see you met Karl.”
“Hey mate.” He and Karl clap each other on the shoulder in greeting before they both turn their attention back to you. “Found your girl here making googly eyes over the set.”
“Woooaahhhh!” Both you and Jack speak up simultaneously, protesting with your hands raised defensively.
“Cousin,” Jack interjects. “She’s my cousin visiting to check out the set, she’s a huge Trekkie.”
Karl’s eyes seem to light up, maybe just your imagination again, but he looks over you again with a smile across his face. “Cousin?” He quirks his brow and in his Bones voice says, “Good god man she looks nothing like you.”
“Guess I got the good genes. And sense of humor. And she doesn’t get out much socially so she’s sort’ve weird …” Jack shrugs.
You narrow your eyes at him, but Karl speaks up. “Yeah yeah mate. I’d be hiding my cousins too if any of them looked like her.” The blush creeps back across yo
