Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 “Nat, this isn’t funny.” “I’m sorry, Clint, but you’ll have to wait for the briefing like everyone else,” Natasha sighed. “Or you could start getting in on the spy-business side of things. Your choice.” She arched an eyebrow at him. The archer’s frown deepened. “We agreed that the concerns of the Avengers would be held above those of our S.H.I.E.L.D. missions.” “Yes, but this isn’t Avengers business yet; it’s Tony Stark’s personal life,” the assassin countered. “The clean-up of that building collapse was awful thorough for things to be just a personal matter, and Stark has been acting different since then: weird even by his standards, and his brain is like––like a bag of cats!” “Don’t steal my similes,” Bruce cut in, looking mildly uncomfortable. Natasha looked inappropriately amused at that, her mask sharp and bright and infuriating as she liked to keep it when provoking someone into throwing a punch. “Very astute of you, there, Clint.” More so than you know. “Barton, Romanov, sit down,” Steve cut in, his voice commandingly steely, but still earnest enough to sound exasperated around the edges. “This is supposed to be a constructive meeting, addressing legitimate concerns.” “I think it’s legitimately concerning how much we don’t know about what happened on that last mission,” Clint cut in, voice low and mutinous. “Something is off, here.” “You’re just irritated that Tony managed to knock you out in your last sparring session,” Natasha sighed. “He wasn’t that strong before.” The archer’s eyes narrowed. “He was toying with me, pulling his punches until I pissed him off enough. You remember, Cap, how he threw you across the room last month?” Steve frowned at him. “A month and a half ago. Clint, that was clearly-” “I can’t do that, and I’ve had years more physical training than Tony goddamn Stark. Has he been mucking about with any new biochemistry that you know of, Bruce?” “No, it’s not really his field of interest, except where keeping himself alive is concerned: most notably how to avoid any future metal poisoning,” Bruce replied coolly. “He still can’t stand the smell of burnt Palladium, from what I understand. A couple of weeks ago, he consulted me not long ago to run some tests on his blood for any abnormalities that might be caused by the chemicals, radiation levels, and other environmental factors he’s exposed to daily. I’m still working on it.” Natasha sighed. “Fine. Fine. He’s been––given a gift, I guess, is the way to put it. Fury hasn’t wanted to discuss it with us because he suspects we know more than we’re letting on, and because I think he wants to see how your tests go, Bruce, since Tony wouldn’t let S.H.I.E.L.D. take any samples.” “A gift,” Clint repeated in flat, disbelieving tones. “From who?” “Whom,” Steve corrected quietly. The assassin ran a hand through her hair, avoiding all eyes but Bruce’s. She raised her eyebrows at him. He paled visibly. “No,” Bruce rasped. “They couldn’t possibly-” “What? Who couldn’t?” “Stop, I get the sinking feeling that I’ve worked it out,” Steve said sharply, and silence fell if only for a few seconds. “Where did the tesseract come from again, Clint? Think about it.” “From Thor’s dad,” the archer replied slowly. “And what two representatives from that same general region of the universe have been capable of surviving things that would kill most people, and capable of easily flinging me across a room?” Steve asked, pinching the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger. “I don’t like where this is going,” Clint said quietly. “He’s not having an affair with Thor is he? That can’t be what he meant about missing this little meeting because of Norse gods and their leather fetishes.” “That’s what he told you?” Natasha sputtered, trying visibly not to laugh. “I don’t like you keeping all these secrets any more than Clint does, Natasha,” said the man out of time in low, dangerous tones. “I know I’m out of touch with a number of modern ideas, but I did know Stark’s father. There are aspects of his son’s... reputation that aren’t of any surprise to me. Norse gods would’ve been a new one even for Howard, though.” “Singular, not plural,” Natasha corrected idly. “Dr. Foster incidentally doesn’t strike me as a woman inclined to share.” Bruce cleared his throat. “This does explain that particular lab incident.” “You knew?!” Clint all but squeaked. “Hard to miss. That was one of the main reasons I moved most of my equipment out of the shared laboratory space,” Bruce muttered. “Now that I didn’t need to know,” Steve said, sounding uneasy. “We all knew about his business deal with Asgard,” Natasha said simply. “We all knew it was Loki, not Thor, who brokered it. Fury briefed all of us on that entire debacle a few months ago.” “I still can’t believe he agreed to work with that fucker,” the archer muttered, “but I suppose if they were going at it like rabbits, it makes a little more sense from a crazed Tony Stark perspective.” “If not for Loki, T
