Chapter 1: Stephen
    




Chapter Text





Pulsating pain, formed somewhere under the heart. The pain that is not yours, that belonging to another person, but which feels like your own. The pain that a soulmate feels. The pain that flowing through the veins to the scorched initials on the wrist.
Stephen Strange doesn’t feel this connection, he’s interested in the concept of soulmate marks, he’s interested in the invisible connection of people with each other through destiny, but he doesn’t feel his soulmate and their bonds. He looks at his own mark with the thin letters of the initials of someone else’s name, AS,  that on his wrist stood out like a burn, and didn’t feel the taut thread between himself and his soulmate.
By the time the people started talking about him, as the most promising young surgeon, Stephen almost forgot about the existence of someone else’s initials on his wrist.
Stephen Strange lived like most of the people on the planet, not really caring about his soulmate. His life was completely carefree, until 2008, when a terrible pain in his chest knocked down his legs. Everything hurts like hell. There was a feeling that splinters were scattered all over his body and pushed hard against the skin, under the ribs, straight to the heart. Everything passes quickly, and Stephen stands leaning on the table, and tries to catch his breath. His mark burns and signals that his soulmate is in pain, but Stephen can only clenches his teeth and suffer.
After the first outbreak of pain pass about three months, and the new one does not follow, which makes Stephen feel relieved. He works as usual, flirts with Christine and doesn’t look at her wrist - there not his initials anyway.
Stephen Strange looks at the TV screen in the staff break rooms, and feels mark itching on the wrist. Three months Tony Stark was listed as missing, and now he’s stands infront of camera, beaten, but alive, and declares that he is closing the production of weapons of his company. Stephen looks at him, at his dark shirt and his chest, as if looking for something, but turns away indifferently. He doesn’t care.
