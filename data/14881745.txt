Summary: Post Civil War, Tony has to build a new team of Avengers. Aside from new recruits, there are also two well-known Avengers that return to Earth – with a ship full of refugees. New and more functional Avengers rise from the ashes of the old and new alliances, new friendships and even new relationships are formed. Though the biggest wild-card proves to be Loki, not entirely unexpected.

New and Improved Avengers

Chapter 1: The List
Tony was holding a glass of whiskey in one hand, twirling it. He had been holding it for two hours now. He hadn't taken a sip yet. He had been sober for years now. But the thought...He is my friend.And the feeling of the shield coming down on his chest, breaking the armor and effectively breaking the fragile reconstructed bones in his sternum. He reached out with his other hand to tap the ARC reactor, newly put back in to hold his chest and keep him going.He heaved a deep sigh as he looked at the list in front of him. Paper. No fancy holograms. Just simple, old-fashioned paper. A list. A short list. A pathetic list. Three columns.
Steve
Natasha
Clint
Sam
Wanda
Scott Lang
Wanted fugitives. Wanted terrorists. Former Avengers. People he had trusted – well, most of them at least – and who had betrayed him. Him and the team. He closed his eyes for a long moment.
(Rhodey)
Vision
(Peter)
The other column. The Avengers who still remained. Rhodey was still struggling with his recovery. Peter was just a teen. Tony was torn about him. In theory, putting him on the roster would be the right decision – because a team didn't just mean that Peter had to come when they called to risk his life. A team would mean that the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man would have a team to back him up. Someone he could call for help when he uncovered something too large to handle. Like, for example, the Vulture. Tony wished he would have been more available – but SI had been facing serious repercussions in the aftermath of the so-called Civil War to the point where Tony had to sell the Avengers Tower (granted, he also wanted to sell the blasted reminder of what had been). In an ideal situation, there would have been an actual team and while Tony was busy with SI, another Avenger could have come to aid Peter. That was what a team should do for each other.That had never worked with the Avengers before though, that was never what the Avengers had been – and maybe that had been the root of their problems from the get-go. When Thor had returned to Earth after the whole Chitauri incident, he hadn't called any of the Avengers, he had dealt with the problem with the Dark Elves (Tony was still doubtful about that) alone with Jane and not long ago, there had been selfies from students posted online with Thor, who had again not called. Whenever Tony had faced a personal crisis, like the Mandarin, well, he couldn't find it in himself to ask his team for help either. When Steve found out Bucky was still alive and that HYDRA had infiltrated SHIELD, he had taken it on alone with Natasha and Sam – and well, perhaps Tony should have seen that as a warning sign too. They had been thrown together without even knowing each other, in a crisis. And then, they had only come together again for the next crisis. There had been no team-building, no trust. Solo acts. Like Bruce just fucking off to who-knew-where.Maybe that had always been the problem
