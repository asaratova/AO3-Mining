All is going according to plan.TonyStarkAkaGod @CaptainStRogers And is it really worse than your first go? You accidentally got ‘how to compose a twit’ trending worldwide.CaptainStRogers @TonyStarkAkaGod I thought it was the Googling search thing!TonyStarkAkaGod @CaptainStRogers I have to say, for a twit, you were very composed about it all.TonyStarkAkaGod @CaptainStRogers Composed as balls.DeadlyNatasha @TonyStarkAkaGod Must you reference your manly insecurities in every tweet to Steve, Stark? Some of us could go a day without it.TonyStarkAkaGod @DeadlyNatasha I refuse to accept that the 'as balls' joke is dead. Comatose, maybe, but there's life in it yet.

Call PETA. Get Tasha to do one of those naked shoots they’re so fond of. THAT would boost our image.TonyStarkAkaGod And sales of Kleenex.TonyStarkAkaGod Then again, she’s Russian. She probably wears a fox fur bra.TonyStarkAkaGod Or is that cavewomen? I forget.FuriousFury Do something, Stark, or the Twitter accounts are shut down and Coulson moves into Avengers Tower.TonyStarkAkaGod You’re my least favourite babysitter ever. I’m telling Hill.FuriousFury It was Hill’s idea.TonyStarkAkaGod Ave Maria.TonyStarkAkaGod If I can’t save Avengers Tower, you can be damn sure I’ll avenge it.FuriousFury It’s time for a bit of blue sky thinking, Stark.TonyStarkAkaGod Actually, I think it’s time for a star spangl
