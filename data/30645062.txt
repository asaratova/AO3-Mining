  Part I: This Will Be The Day

 “For it is in passing that we achieve immortality, through this we become a paragon of virtue and glory to rise above all, infinite in distance and unbound by death. I release your soul and by my shoulder protect thee.” 

 - Pyrrha Nikos, RWBY

//It is said, by someone far wiser than the one weaving this together, that the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect.It’s an entirely fun philosophical bent, of course, but that’s not really the point right now. The point, metaphorically speaking, is that at this particular junction in the timeline of the world, there was a woman of whom had quite a bit of love and respect going for her, and so with that in mind one could measure her life and find it to be quite a large measure. Her name was Wanda Maximoff, and she was quite simply, the most beautiful woman of them all.This was quite obvious, because in all honesty if you got this far in the series with which this story was attached to then in all honesty if she wasn’t the most beautiful woman on Earth then  somebody was wasting his time in spectacular fashion, though admittedly he usually felt like he was doing that but for the most part he really wasn’t, at least not when it came to things of this particular persuasion. But enough of that.At this particular point in the timeline, Wanda Maximoff was a thirty-one year old woman, of a brunette persuasion, with pale skin and a capstone of light green eyes. She was a teacher down at the local college, in the psychology field to be exact, in addition to the equally local high school, where she switched from psychology to literature, and taught a perfectly good English class for all those who wondered what it was that she taught. Double Majors, baby!For all intents and purposes, she was sort of an ordinary person. She went to work, got paid, went home and enjoyed her weekends like everybody else, whiling away the endless wheel of time by doing things of scholarly, silly and sappy nature, though to her dismay she had no one to share the latter with, because well, the only person who she consistently spent time with wasn’t really much for sappy things in that kind of way because this wasn’t Alabama goddammit. Needless to say, as it turned out, our sort-of-intrepid heroine was the romantic sort, and what is a heart that beats alone but a little bit sorrowful? Though she probably would’ve killed anyone who said otherwise, the point was, Wanda Maximoff was alone in life, and not a soul loved her in the kind of way that would’ve led to romantic walks on the beach and kisses under the stars and really, really,  really good sex that left her breathless and carrying a baby...or four or five or more.Or so she thought, anyways.For, at this particular moment, there were four (no, make that five) lives she had touched, in some form or another, and to say that they loved her would’ve been an understatement. Admittedly, they had very different values of love, but that was mostly because every single life that had been touched by her wasn’t even twenty, so...things were rather different, to say the least. And so, with nothing else left to be said about our lovely cast, the world-weaver stepped aside, a metaphorical waving of a wand(a) signifying the start of our story.
 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...

//“Oh my god, Wanda…”It was a tossup as to who had said that, to be perfectly honest, but it was sort of irrelevant, because, in a first for these kinds of things, the woman in question was nowhere to be found. In fact, the aforementioned Wanda wasn’t even in the same room, or perhaps even the city, dependent upon where exactly she lived. It was a long story that would bear a bit of explanation, but if anyone really wanted to know, Wanda was present…...as a photograph.A neatly printed out photo, to be exact, but we’re not talking about the kind of printed photo that is the kind you pop out of a printer, we’re talking about someone who went to some serious lengths to make it a  photo, glossy sheen and all, which spoke to how much money a certain someone had to throw at
