Chapter Text

Chapter # 1 – The calm before the storm?
It had started off as such a nice evening. Well, perhaps nice is not quite the right word for Tony Stark being forced to grace a charity function with his presence, especially when it wasn’t even a Stark International function. Okay, his evening thus far had sucked. A charity cause he could care less about, boring people and bad booze. But hey, when compared to a surprise visit by the Asgardian Royal family he’d been having a wonderful time. OoooODistinctive ring tones are a god send, Tony thought as he silenced his phone without even looking at it. While Jarvis had several ring tones of his own, the one that Tony had just received from him was not one of his emergency ones.Replacing the phone in his pocket; Tony smoothed down the jacket of his new David August suit. The fine black material was so rich it almost glowed. Just as he was adjusting his crisp white cuffs in preparation to get back to some serious smarming, his phone rang again.Jarvis.Again.Same ignorable ring tone. Tony smiled at the blonde in front of him, with perhaps just a bit more teeth than he normally showed as he again silenced his phone.“So Marilyn—”“Maria,” said those luscious apricot glazed lips, with just the tiniest hint of tightening in irritation for Tony, again not using the woman’s correct name. Her blonde hair, natural for a wonder, rippled as she tossed it back with one hand, not accidently shifting and highlighting some impressive parts of her anatomy. Then her big brown eyes deliberately softened as she tried to regain the mood that had originally captured the billionaire’s interest. Said billionaire, didn’t really want to be here. Charity events were Pepper’s gigs not his. But if Tony has to attend boring charity functions, complete with bad booze, he at least wants to be left alone during this one bright spot in his evening. Melis--, er Maria has a rocking body that her thin champagne sheath dress shows it off to perfection. As if she didn’t know it.And standing in front of this display of a proposed research new wing, with the various lights washing down from all different directions… Let us just say that her pale thin dress was not leaving anything to the engineer’s imagination. Which is quite the accomplishment, since Tony has a really good imagination and can imagine quite a lot.  He mentally sent kudos to the maintenance and lighting crews for making Martha’s dress almost disappear.“So Mister Stark--” Maria purred.“Tony. Please, call me Tony.”Maria swept her lashes down, before peering up mischievously from underneath them, “All right then… Tony--”It was contrived of course, but hey, he could still admire it couldn’t he? He was just leaning in to catch whatever that dark sultry voice was going to say next, when his phone went off for the third time. This time it was one of Jarvis’ message tones.For something that was not on the emergency notification list, his AI was being pretty fucking annoying this evening. Showing still more teeth, Tony gritted out, “One moment.” As he quickly dug his phone out of his pocket and shut the damn thing off.“Now, where were we,” he asked empting his glass and handing it off to a passing server. Tony knew he might need both hands pretty soon, so it paid to think ahead.He and Monica had just reset their positions, him interested and appreciative of the view, her breathlessly excited to be within ten feet of an unmarried billionaire and were preparing to move on to the next step of the dance when he heard his name being called.Tony groaned to himself.Pepper, calling his name was striding towards them as fast as her tight fishtail gown allowed.“Tony! There you are, thank goodness I found you,” she said handing him her phone. “Jarvis really needs to talk to you, he said it’s important.”While Tony normally would have appreciated how well Pepper’s royal blue, off the shoulder gown matched her eyes, right now it only drew his attention to the fact that those narrowed blue eyes were fastened on the hand that was stroking Tony’s arm.Rolling his eyes, Tony slipped away from the blonde fondling his arm and took the phone off of Pepper.I swear I am going to update Jarvis’ protocols before the week is out, he thought savagely.“Excuse me ladies,” he said with a charming if false smile as he slipped away and headed towards the hallway.“Well that was fucking awkward,” Tony muttered to himself, walking another few yards before he leaned disgustedly against the wall.“Jarvis, I swear I’m going to donate you to a public library. Why in the hell are you bothering me?”“I’m sorry sir, but you really need to return to the tower immediate
