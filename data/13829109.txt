Chapter 1: Interruption
    




Chapter Text
Bucky wakes up from cryo to a frazzled looking teenager with braids tied back into a ponytail. He nearly takes a swing at her on instinct, but his body and mind are too sluggish to do much beside raise his arm feebly and by that point he realizes she’s not a threat despite the panic in her stance.“I am sorry to wake you like this Sergeant Barnes but we have to go.” She explains quickly, taking his hand and helping him step out of the cryo pod.“Whas goin on?” He tries but his words are a slur. “Whas wrong wit me?” He tried again but nothing close to intelligible comes from his lips.“You are still ‘thawing’ for lack of a better term.” She quickly explains in hushed tones, his slur having been understandable enough. She leads him to a wall in the lab and raises her wrist to it, the panel lighting up before falling away. “You are not fixed yet Sergeant”“Call me Bucky” he interrupts, nearly tripping over his feet as she practically pulls him down a staircase.“Everything will be fine, I just need to get you to a more secure location.”Three more secret doors and they enter a room with another cryo pod, this one older looking that the one upstairs but still light years better than what HYDRA had used.She moved quickly to the control panel, her fingers flying across the interface and powering up the pod. “Next time we see each other” she trailed off and for the first time he noticed the remnants of tear tracks on her face. She’d been crying and recently.“I promised your friend I would fix you and I will.” She said with a hopeful smile but he couldn’t help but feel it was forced.Despite that he stepped into the pod and said, “Can’t say I know exactly who you are, but I trust you. Your people haven’t given me a reason not to.” He tried to give her a smile, the winning one James Buchanan Barnes had been known for back in the day, it came out weaker than he’d wanted but she still returned it.“Rest well Bucky.”As the pod closed and he felt the chill seep back into his bones, he realized that he had remembered how he’d been before the army, but before he could think further everything faded to black.
