The Avengers had gathered back up in Tony's erstwhile penthouse to make the reports. Downstairs, clean-up continued apace, mostly following Natasha's path through the enemy. Except for the testing floor where they'd tried to take Tony. Stark had advised that they leave the machinery to him, once what was left of the bodies themselves were taken away. Taking one look at the slaughterhouse at the end of the lab, there hadn't been a single SHIELD agent who'd felt like arguing.Clint couldn't blame them. But right now, he had a few other concerns. "... They were in location above the assembly array, so I had JARVIS activate the disassembly programme we use for the armour while they were in range. Since human bodies aren't made of gold-titanium ..."Clint didn't flinch. Much. Remembering the blood-painted metal limbs, the remains of what had been four men. He didn't flinch.He also didn't blink, as Stark casually - and apparently without any thought at all - lied straight to Fury's face. With not even a blip, not even a twitch. So utterly casual about it that Clint almost started wondering if he'd imagined things himself. If he'd seen what he thought he'd seen. Stark's version slotted perfectly into his. Clint hadn't heard whatever Stark had said just before JARVIS ... happened. It could have been an order to activate the array, though Clint wondered why the hell they'd clustered closer instead of backing the hell off, if that had been the case. But then, they hadn't been exactly the smart breed of kidnappers to start with, or they'd never had tried to take Tony Stark in the middle of a fucking machine shop. So. Plausible, maybe.And, too, there was no way for Clint to judge how JARVIS functioned. How the hell would he know the difference between JARVIS activating a pre-programmed system and letting it do its thing, just on the wrong target, and JARVIS taking complete and autonomous control of an array and using it to deliberately tear some people to pieces?He wouldn't. Couldn't. He had nowhere near the expertise to prove Tony a liar. He doubted there was a single person in the world who did. In terms of technical capabilities, there was no way Clint could know for sure what JARVIS had done.But ...You realise your AI just ate them, right?I don't give a fuck.He couldn't tell what JARVIS was capable of. But Tony could. And Tony, crouched there, with his arm around his fallen friend and all the fury in the world in his face ... Tony had known, exactly, what JARVIS had done. Tony hadn't flinched from Clint's assertation, hadn't blinked at the concept that JARVIS could do what Clint thought he'd done. Clint had all but accused JARVIS to his face ... and Tony hadn't blinked.So, yeah. Clint had no way to read JARVIS, no way to doubt the AI. But Stark? Tony? That was a different story. Tony, right now, was lying through his teeth, and Clint knew it.The question was, what the fuck did he do about it? On the one hand, as a SHIELD agent, the existence of a partially-or-fully autonomous killer AI was the sort of thing you should probably tell your boss about. And if there was ever a question of 'need to know', Fury had made it very, very clear that he always needed to know. On the other ...
I've got you, buddy. Me and JARVIS, we got you. You're going to be a-okay, got it?
On the other hand, Clint wasn't sure this was really the right time to test a paranoid Tony Stark's ability to be rational in the face of perceived or potential threats to his AIs, when not so long ago he'd watched one of them be shot, risked his life to protect it, and then completely failed to care when the other one tore some men to shreds in their defense. This might not be the best moment to create another potential threat. Especially when they were still in the Tower, and JARVIS was still right there, listening.There were times when discretion was the better part of valour, was Clint's point. Knowing the right moment to pass information on was one of the first things they taught you, in this job.Mostly by letting the consequences of picking the wrong moment speak for themselves."Agent Barton?" Clint looked up, at Fury's dry tone, and the narrow, contemplative glint in that one, staring eye. The head of SHIELD met his gaze impassively. "Got anything you'd like to add?"Tony didn't look at him. Lounging against the wall beside Bruce, a couple of butterfly stitches over one of the larger cuts near his temple, Tony raised a curious eyebrow at Fury, and didn't look at Clint at all.With the silent, invisible presence of JARVIS all around them, maybe he didn't have to.Clint paused. Looking at Fury. Looking at the man who'd had their backs when someone was shooting fully-authorised missiles at Manhattan, the man who would cheerfully and remorselessly lie to the government's face when it came to protecting his people. The man who'd listened to Clint, when he brought Natasha in, said she could be trusted, when Natasha'd had a reputation for wrapping men a
