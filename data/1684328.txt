Chapter 1: Darcy/Clint, skype
    




Chapter Text
"So, how long am I supposed to play nice before I ask when your shirt’s coming off…?" Clint sighed at her. “Romance is lost on you, Lewis. You’re supposed to at least ask me how my day’s going, let me commiserate a while, take an interest in my hobbies…” Darcy shook her head, raising a finger disagreeably. “A) You can’t tell me where you are or what you’re doing, even though we both know you’re shooting shit, it’s pretty much a given. B) I know your hobbies; refer back to A. And C) I am so romantic. I made a playlist for this very skype conversation!”"Does it have ‘Baby Got Back’ on it? Because if it does, you lose, and I win, and you owe me dinner and a movie." She paused, her eyes darting to the left, and then said, “I will marathon Netflix with you and buy you a meatball sandwich from that street vendor you like, and that is the best you’re going to get.” He huffed a laugh at her and leaned back in his bunk, laptop balanced in his lap. “Deal.” "Good. Now show momma the goods," she said, making ‘gimme’ hands at the camera. He rolled his eyes, but he took his shirt off all the same, and Darcy sighed happily. “So worth a meatball sub.”
