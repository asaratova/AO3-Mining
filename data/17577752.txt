Chapter 1: Settling in
    




Chapter Text
Okay, bit of background before we get stuck in.  This is an Omegaverse story.The entire population is either Alpha, Beta and Omega. The muggle world don't know about the Wizarding world except for SHIELD and that's because MACUSA told them about magic before.True Alpha-Omega pairs are incredibly rare but special in both worlds, as such an Alpha is allowed to kill or seriously maim someone if they believe that person to be a threat to their Omega. Separating a true pair is beyond bad, it's illegal and causes great pain for the Omega and has been known to kill the Omega. When an Alpha meets their True Omega they immediately enter a rut and seek to claim, nothing will stand in their way. The Alpha's rut will often send the Omega into Heat and give off pheromones to warn others and accept the Alpha's advances. Once the claiming has been completed and Omega was been bitten the bond overrides any and all mind magics, controls and contracts.
