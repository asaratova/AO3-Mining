Chapter 1: Dashing - Gol D. Roger/Harry Potter (One Piece) - continuation
    




Chapter Text

Rouge couldn’t believe that all of this was happening while she had gone and stepped away from the crew for a moment. Riot had been interested in something at the bay, and with the marines creeping up on them Roger had shooed her away from where the bulk of the crew had been fighting.
 
After all, she and Riot were much more able to hide in plain sight, making it impossible for marines to find them and to use them against Roger and his crew.
 
It shouldn’t have surprised Rouge that the Marines and the World Government were more than willing to use a person’s soulmate against someone if they didn’t like the person in question. The very first time she had been accosted by a Marine Officer, she had given the man a reason to fear her - subsequently earning herself a bounty poster.
 
The first time they had tried to use Riot, she had gone ballistic. The Marines were aware that if they wanted to accost her, Riot, or the crew, to send at least a vice-admiral. This wasn’t the case today, but the way she had heard those marines talking it would be best if she stayed out of this fight.
 
Which made it all the more unnerving to see the sky suddenly splitting open, a wave of her husband’s haki, as well as familiar other haki, spiking the air. She knew that Roger let himself go sometimes, but she hadn’t expected that to happen against marines, at least not without Garp present.
 
Sighing, she picked up Riot and dashed into the direction of the fight. She was quite curious as to who the crew were fighting and whether it was worth coming back to. She didn’t want to leave her lover all alone, even if he was more than capable of taking care of himself and their crew. She couldn’t help but worry, least of all when Roger had suddenly started coughing not that long ago and tried to hide it from her.
 
His excuse that Crocus had told him that there was nothing more they could do, had her giving her lover the stink eye. Sitting him down, she told the whole story of how she got there and the abilities she did possess. Just as well as show him a bit of magic, healing him in the same breath as she grumbled about him not telling her these things.
 
“What do you think your father is up to this time?”
 
Looking at Riot, her little boy grinned at her, “Trouble.”
 
Stifling a giggle, Rouge grinned, “Most likely. Let’s go and see if he needs help getting out of trouble, alright?”
 
As Riot nodded, she dashed through the sand and into the direction of the sound of fighting. Roger sure liked finding trouble wherever he went, not that she could blame him. That would be hypocritical, as Rouge found trouble wherever she went just the same.
 
Finding the fight, she held Riot in her lap as she sat down in the dunes surrounding the two fighting crews, of course it was Newgate. He and Roger kept finding each other now and again, starting a fight which would turn into a party soon after. She also knew better to interfere, choosing instead to keep Riot close so he wouldn’t get lost in the fight and hurt. All the while she looked over her own crew, and Whitebeard’s to see if anyone needed urgent care. None of them were doing this to actually hurt each other, but accidents were known to happen.
 
She was quite looking forward to the party section of this fight, especially as it seemed that Newgate had picked up some more crew members. The man with the two swords looked to be very interesting; his way of dressing let her know that he was most likely from Wano.
