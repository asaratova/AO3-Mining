"Before we start, I just want to say that the Lewis rule applies."Darcy turns to look at Clint, one of her eyebrows perched high in warning. "Okay, so I would be verrrrry careful about how you answer this next question." She turns to look at Steve and his face is kinda pissy as well, like he's anticipating the stupid fucking shit that is bound to pour out of Clint's mouth and he's getting ready to chew his ass out on her behalf.Frankly, Darcy's never been one that has appreciated overprotectiveness in a partner. She lived through the Spice Girls and Sydney Bristow - she knows how to take care of herself and not rely on a man for much of anything. (Okay, it's not so much the Spice Girls who helped with that but her deadbeat father and a string of spectacularly terrible boyfriends, but Darcy has a rich fantasy life and prefers not to linger on reality.) All that being said, she's not quite sure why she loves it when Steve goes all protective over her, but she does. It makes her tingle in very special places. She realizes this might put her in shit with the sisterhood, but considering the way Natasha is fucking through her FUCK list thanks to their little trade, she might already be on their shitlist."Clint, what is the Lewis rule?"Clint grins like a maniac. "No current boyfriends/girlfriends/anatomical robots on your MARRY FUCK KILL list." He turns quickly to give a questioning look to Carolyn, who is fussing with a bunsen burner. The look she returns him oozes zero. fucks. given."Ah, proceed, good sir," Darcy says as she salutes Clint and he returns it."Um, no," Steve interjects, his brow knitted in concern. They've already had this chat and he fully understands that she is also of the zero fucks given persuasion when it comes to MFK, but apparently the game messes with his old timey values that Darcy has decided to find endearing. "I don't think so."Behind him, Barnes makes a cracking whip sound.Darcy spins on him, pinning him with her meanest stare. Barnes looks entirely unperturbed and it annoys the everliving fuck out of her."Yeah, who's getting laid on a regular basis, Barnes?" Darcy asks in a sing-song voice. "Answer: not you."Barnes cocks his head like a confused, metal-armed puppy. "Aww, is that an offer?"Weirdly enough, this exchange does not set off Steve's internal macho man. She's stopped trying to figure out how Steve processes Barnes and his big, fat mouth."Only to add you to my kill list, buddy.""You mean I wasn't your KILL?" He sounds genuinely surprised. That's not what disturbs Darcy. What weirds the fuck out of Darcy is that he actually looks… pleased."Oh god," Tony says, "it was me, wasn't it?"She ignores them and turns back to Steve."Seriously though, Steve, I don't mind. This is supposed to be fun! Just pretend I got turned into an alpaca and you had to, sadly, and after a lonnnng mourning period, move on."Steve looks… well, he mostly looks confused. Behind him, Barnes's shoulders are shaking with silent laughter.Jane's mouth is hanging open; although she did hang Steve's drawing on the wall in her apartment, she still hasn't quite gotten over Darcy turning Thor into a llama. "Jesus, Darcy, what is it with you and the farm animals?"Darcy shrugs, then grins. "I would be a stunning alpaca, okay? My wool would be renowned throughout the land, all the dude alpacas would want to get with this, and I would have tons of very talented, beautiful alpacaettes.""Also called crias," Carolyn says, slapping Clint's hand away as it slowly shimmies up her thigh."Really?" Darcy is actually a bit disappointed. But also: "Is there a part of your brain reserved for shit like this? Like what a baby lemur is called, what a group of ferrets is called...""A business," Carolyn answers."Are you fucking kidding me?""Nope."Jane holds up her hands and growls lightly. "That's it, I'm going back to the mold."(Oh yeah, has Darcy failed to mention that four months later they are still fucking watching mold grow? Apparently it has some mystical hooha properties that could revolutionize wound treatment, but they can't find a way to make it grow on Earth - J'excuse… MIDGARD. Jane's been trying to create some sort of sustained energy field that mimics Asgardian atmospheric pressure. At this point Darcy would rather die from a sucking chest wound than fill beakers full of pig shit and alien mold again.)Sighing in defeat, Jane kinda shakes her head and walks away. Whatever, she can enjoy the mold patrol alone for the time being, Darcy will just have to run the risk of missing the epic event of a spore growing. She will learn to live with disappointment."Pop quiz, hot shot," Darcy says, pointing a finger gun at Carolyn. "Group of hippopotamuses!""A BLOAT!" Carolyn yells, so loud that Clint actually flinches and moves away from her."Pew pew," Darcy crows, firing her finger gun. Carolyn returns fire."Oh my god, there's two of them," Tony says as he turns to face Clint, horrified. -- "Why are none of the guys participa
