  Contrary to common belief, Bucky is far more familiar with Tony Stark than he’s ever let on: Once upon a time when the protocols were all that made up the shell that was Bucky Barnes, Howard Stark ended up on Hydra’s own version of a Christmas List.And while Howard pleaded with “Sergeant Barnes” to spare him, it was not Howard that had shaken the protocols loose.Only hours after the mission was complete, the orders were given that the family in its entirety would be wiped out too in order to properly “cut off any loose threads”. It would be simpler than the initial job given. There was no need to make it an accident; the only remaining person in the Stark clan was a self-destructive teenage genius by the name of Tony Stark, and the only thing the Winter Soldier would have to keep an eye out for was the teenager’s robot.In the labs of MIT with no one around, it shouldn’t have taken more than ten minutes, in and out, to get the job done.In the end, the mission was never completed.The robot, Dummy, as Tony referred to it as, lifted the teenager up to play, and had unceremoniously forgotten its own strength and launched Tony across the room into a pile of discarded boxes.For a second, the Soldier had been at a loss.Was it still mission complete if Tony died on his own?The question was quickly discarded when the robot chased after him, beeping in alarm, and then offering a tentative claw to the pile of limbs sticking out from the lumpy cardboard mattress.  Tony accepted the offered hand with a groan, and the Soldier relaxed. Before startling at his own reaction, and then spending the next half an hour listening to Tony talk to his robot in mockingly reprimanding tones, “You’re always causing me trouble, you know that?”Absently, the seventeen-year-old rubbed the growing bump at the back of his head, but continued to smile softly, sadly, at the robot he’d built with his own two hands, polishing and appraising the framework as Tony soothed, “It's okay though. Everything’s gonna be alright.”Dummy beeped in reply, and Tony chuckled, voice low and comforting, “Yeah, yeah – I love you too, Dumbo, always; you’re family.”In reply, the robot’s claw lifted as if to pat him in return, but was abruptly halted from doing so when Tony raised his own hand with an overly exasperated, “uh-uh-uh”.Apparently put out, Dummy’s claw retracted and straightened too far up that it hit the sprinkler on the ceiling, triggering the fire alarm and alerting campus security and the fire department in one loud shriek.In seconds the room was drenched, and the last thing the Soldier heard before retreating was Tony’s incredulous laugh.The Soldier had been punished for not completing the mission, but it was decided that the penalty was worth it. Tony lived another day, and Bucky started to rouse from the consciousness of the Soldier.Even with their body ravaged by the electrical currents forced on him and the Soldier both, consoling them with a gentle voice, murmuring in a kindness not meant for them, Tony’s voice came, “It’s gonna be okay.”When next they were roused, the Soldier was no longer alone, and with their hearing attuned – they waited once more for that voice – that laugh.It had been unintentional, but once they’d been sent out on their next mission, finding the source of that sweet voice, coaxing and cajoling thoughtless affection and aching fondness; seemed just as important as the mission itself.Fortunately, it was easier than expected.After successfully avoiding his own assassination, Tony had taken up his father’s seat in the family kingdom and raised an empire in its wake. Crime families and rebel militia the world over salivated over his weapons while the world beyond broadcasted his infamous self-introduction: Tony Stark, billionaire-genius-playboy-philanthropist.Thereafter, their every defrost was marked by Tony: There was never an awakening that hadn’t been punctuated by Tony’s voice, his smirks and cheeky grins shaping every syllable of every soundbite and interview he’d ever done.They’d measure time and mark dates based on the cadence of Tony’s sentences, the duration of his amusement, the imagined curl of his lip as he spoke.Bucky, for his part, hadn’t even realized he’d been doing it this long until, for the first time since he’d been defrosted, and he hadn’t heard Tony say a word.While media outlets in the past year only ever read the statements given by Stark Industries, or the Avengers as a collective; Tony’s lack of voice over the airwaves was one thing, but Bucky is actually living at the Compound now, and he still hasn’t heard Tony say a damn thing.A petty part of Bucky had been looking forward to hearing the genius’ sharp tongue in person – getting to finally complete the picture Tony would make with that curl at the corner of his mouth, the golden brightness of his eyes. And yet…Tony has no quips for the Rogues, and nothing but a profoundly unimpressed expression for every attempt at an argument they try
