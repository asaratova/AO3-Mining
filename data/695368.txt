Chapter Text
Tenderness, as a noun, appears in Chaucer. It's often translated as conscience, in modern versions: awareness of, responsibility to, the feelings of others.
Erik, who got bored waiting for a target once in a Canterbury hotel and picked up a ridiculous tourist copy of the Tales, has read the Middle English, and the translations, multiple times over by now. Humanity at its best, and worst, all right there in those pages.
Conscience, he thinks, looking up from his spot by the fire as Charles comes back over with their drinks, settling neatly into his previous spot between Erik's legs and finding his own book again; and Erik looks into blue eyes when they pause to meet his, and smiles in reply.
