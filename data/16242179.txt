Chapter 1: Spider-dude
    




Chapter Text
Peter ate dinner with Clint, which was pretty awesome. They ate their food, yes, but they mostly just attempted to make each other laugh so hard that milk shot out their nose. Both Peter and Clint had succeeded, and both almost regretted it. Almost."Oh, shoot, I haveta do homework." Peter says with a frown after seeing what time it was. No, he didn't, but he wanted to get some patrolling in before Tony took him nighttime driving."No you don't, Pete. It's Friday, you're supposed to enjoy yourself." Clint says with a grin."But if I don't get it done tonight, I won't have the weekend free. You don't want me to have to do homework on the weekend, do you?" Peter asks, a small grin forming on his face."... Fine. But you better have fun on the weekend. You are released." Clint says, waving Peter off."Mmhm. See you later, Clint." Peter says and hurries up to his room. Now time for some patrolling.Peter pulled his suit on and checked his web fluid. He needed to make more, but that could wait. He'd just try not to use as much webs as he usually did. So instead of swinging out of his window on the (almost) top of the Tower, he had the bright idea to scurry down it.Peter knew Friday wasn't going to call him out on it, she wouldn't want Peter to die. Hopefully. He wasn't really counting on Clint to catch him out of the corner of his eye.To Peter, he was just climbing down the Tower. To Clint, it was like a giant spider scurrying down the wall of the Tower.Which just happened to freak the archer out. A lot.Instead of thinking of something reasonable, like the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man climbing down the Tower, Clint just thought of a giant spider-like creature infiltrating their home and laying eggs or something in the vents.So Clint's fear may have been justified, if the archer hadn't been a friggin' Avenger. It was safe to say that Clint successfully spread the uneasyness around the Tower, after Tony hiding a kid from the Avengers, they didn't know what to expect.Clint didn't even suspect Peter, that was completely out of his mind at the moment. What was on his mind was the horror-movie thing outside the Tower, probably trying to get in. Natasha thought he was just freaking himself out, but he wasn't.He was starting to feel a little crazy, though.Wouldn't Friday pick up whatever was on the outside of the building? Why didn't she say anything? Clint tried voicing his worry to Steve, who was with Bucky."It's probably just your imagination. Friday wouldn't let anything get inside." Steve had said, but still looked a little uneasy."Steve's right, Stark's computers wouldn't let anything get inside that would be a danger to Peter." Bucky had said.But Clint knew there was something not right about this.And so he talked to Sam."So I see this thing scurry down the window, it might have been going up. I don't know. Point is, it was outside the Tower, probably trying to get in." Clint says, looking at Sam for any answer that would make him sound not crazy.".... Kinda sounds like Spider-dude." Sam says after a minute of thinking."... Spider-dude?" Clint repeats slowly."Yeah, Spider-dude. He was at the airport, Tony brought him in." Sam says."Why would Spider-dude want to get in the Tower?" Clint asks, confused."How am I supposed to know? Friday would tell us if he got in, though." Sam says, shrugging."You guys talking about Spider-Man?" Rhodey asks curiously as he came into the kitchen."Yeah, Clint saw him trying to get in." Sam says, tossing an apple in the air and catching it.Rhodey was one of the few people that knew who Spider-Man was, and he was not going to tell these people."He was probably just re-loading his webs or something, I wouldn't worry about it." Rhodey says, and as if Parker luck was starting to affect him, a Spider-Man like figure hit against the window right next to him.".... Are we under attack by some Spider-dude?" Sam asks slowly, the figure swinging off into the night again."I don't know, but I really don't like it." Clint says with a frown.Word spread around the Avengers that Spider-Man might be trying to get into the Tower, and most of the Avengers were on edge.Except Steve."So, I gotta ask, why are you not worried about some random guy breaking into the Tower?" Natasha asks curiously."He's not some random guy. He sounded young, I'm guessing he was in his 20s." Steve says. "And he was from Queens.""Just because people are from around where you used to live, doesn't make them automatically trustworthy." Sam says, rolling his eyes."My point is, how much of a threat can he be? There's no way someone that young and from Queens can break into the Tower." Steve says.And at that moment, Peter Parker entered the living room. Oh, the irony. Rhodey could only shake his head in amusement."Whattcha guys talking about?" Peter asks curiously, and kinda nervously, having the feeling he just walked into something important. Clint had no problem sharing, though."Spider-dud
