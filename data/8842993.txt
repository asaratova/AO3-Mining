Chapter Text
Over the course of the next few months, the avengers heard nothing of Tony Stark or Loki.At first they had tried to move on with missions and battles, but the loss of Tony was a blow their unit, on and off the field.Steve watched when Clint would fiddle with his bow, the one Tony made for him, staring wistfully at the door to the lab, “Why didn’t you just tell him?” he whispered. Steve didn’t know, he just didn’t know.Natasha was carefully blank, she spared with them, she attended meetings them, but she didn’t talk to anyone except Clint, and sometimes Steve could swear he felt her eyes pushing daggers into his back, eyes full of accusation, and blame, and guilt.Steve couldn’t blame her.The usually loud and smiling Thor became taciturn and brooding, he spent less and less time on earth or with the avengers.And Bucky…Oh god, Bucky was a disaster, he wouldn’t eat, he barely slept…Steve often found him outside Tony’s old bedroom, tears flowing down his cheeks.“It’s not your fault Buck.” Steve tried once, “I was the one that lied to him, I pretended to be his friend and I betrayed him.”Bucky just shook his head decrepitly, “…You asked me once, if I remembered anything from…that time.”Steve nodded, feeling like his blood was turning to ice,“…At first it was just flashes of things…buildings, smells, colors…” Bucky hung his head, new tears flowing,“But then I started to remember faces…” he whispered, “and I never said anything to him…I never said anything to him, because I wanted to keep him.”He let out a hollow laugh, “…And I lost him anyway.”Steve’s mouth felt dry, he eyes began to sting,So he sat down next to his best friend, and cradled him as they both sobbed at what had been done.
