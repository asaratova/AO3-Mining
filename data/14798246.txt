Chapter 1: T'Challa (and Steve)
    




Chapter Text
 At the end of the Infinity War, as social media and news outlets have come to call it, the Avengers―and by Avengers, Bucky means  Stark ―were to host a ‘Yay, we won!’ party, as the aforementioned man himself called it. It makes Steve smile, all goofy and sweet at the edges, with something eerily close to adoration. “Okay, Tony,” he says, easily, as if anything and everything Stark says or does is, hands-down, the greatest idea ever. Steve’s agreement is almost immediately echoed by T’Challa. “Wakanda will be glad to host our victory,” he interrupts, his voice lilting, regal, in that familiar way Bucky has grown used to. He is watching Stark, eyes intent on the shorter man, as if cataloguing carefully any and every response. It is the sort of intent Bucky knows T’Challa uses to focus on battle strategies―and, for that, it appeals to Bucky as odd for T’Challa to render so much attention to a man like Tony Stark. Stark falters, apparently momentarily thrown by the gesture. “Um, if Your Highness insists.” “I am afraid I must,” T’Challa replies with a teasing grin. “And, at that behest, I must also request you allow me the honor of calling you by your prefered name, if you would allow the familiarity of calling me not by my title but by the name my father bestowed upon me.” Sometimes, in the safeties of his own mind, Bucky thinks the Wakandan royals talk a little insane. Stark is mouthing the word ‘ behest,  ’ but, with the kind of crowd that hung around, Bucky is sure the man is used to it by now. “T’Challa, then,” he says, with a smile that could be called  soft,  and it is in that moment that Bucky finally understands what exactly it means to be in the presence of the Stark Charm, “call me Tony.” T’Challa’s smile reflects Stark’s own. Bucky really should have expected what happens next: T’Challa sidles up to Stark’s side, offering the latter an elbow. With a sort of easy familiarity and confidence that Bucky can admire in a guy, Stark accepts the offer, folding a hand around the inside of T’Challa’s arm. “Where to, my liege?” There is a sort of beauty there, watching those two―a symmetry of regality and gracefulness, both honed by life-long roles. From the corner of his eye, Bucky notices a muscle in Steve’s jaw twitch. “There is someone who has been eagerly waiting to meet your acquaintance, Tony―and, perhaps, you will enjoy her presence as much as I don’t.” That startles a laugh out of Stark. “Is this some sort of relative that you hate to love?” Bucky waits until the trail end of T’Challa’s reply fades to the wind before turning to his best friend with a raised, very judgemental eyebrow. “Possessive much, punk?” “Shut up, Buck,” Steve hisses back. There were Dora milling about still. Bucky snorts. He doesn’t much care about Doras being nosy shits, unlike a certain Black Widow. “Jealousy ain’t a good colour on ya, Stevie. Also, what the fuck are you gonna do against the King of the most powerful country in the world? Challenge him for Stark’s hand in combat?” There is a sudden gleam in Steve’s eye. “Steve,  no ―”
