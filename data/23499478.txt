Chapter 1: Only assholes wear sunglasses inside.
    




Chapter Text

A loud laugh ripped through the quietness of the coffee shop. A few eyes, which where not connected to heads with headphones, threw annoyed glances to the blonde girl in the corner of the room. She was young, probably in her early 20s. Her blonde hair was up, in something resembling a messy bun, but with a strong tilt to the left. She wore a black turtleneck and blue jeans.  She was crackling up about something/someone on her laptop and seemed to not notice that she was talking loud enough to disturb the whole café. Lucky for her, she wasn’t speaking English, so at least not everyone in attendance got to hear her talking about her private life (presumably).  Suddenly she stood up, took her bag and walked through the cafe with her laptop outstretched in front of her. She was still talking to whoever is on the other end of this call. After a few seconds of scurrying around the café, laughing with the other end of the call, she approached the waiter.

“Hey, sorry to bother you, do you have any äh, you know places to ahm, to … charge my laptop? Like the little holes in the walls where the electricity comes out? To charge things,…with my charger?”

 For good measures she showed the waiter her laptop charger, as if he hadn’t understood the “charger” part of her whole speech. The waiter suppressed a laugh and showed her the table in the other corner of the room.  With a bright smile and a bubbly “Thanks” she kept walking to the seats in the other corner of the room. 

How fucking embarrassing… what the hell, you’ll never talk to that waiter ever again. Your friends kept laughing at you trough your Skype call because you didn’t remember the word for “plug”. You told them to fuck off, they couldn’t help you either. They heard you stutter to the waiter and none of them fuckers chimed in with the right word. You reached the corner table where the plugs should be located, only to find it occupied by two men with hoodies deep in their faces and sunglasses. Weird.You kept talking to your friends and tried to steer the conversation to other embarrassing things one of the others did. Laughing you knelt next to one of the men and plugged in your charger and set your laptop on the table. You looked at the men questionably and one of them nodded, with a tight smile, the other tensed. You sat down.  You noticed that the part of the café was very secluded from the rest of the room. Other customers could probably see your back, but not the men in front of you. You kinda got a weird feeling but you forgot about it quickly after one of your friends tried to show new shoes she got and fell off the chair because she wanted to reach them without getting up. Dumbass.You where just tapping the tears off your face from laughing too hard as you noticed that you left your coffee on your old table. You told your friends so, which earned you another laugh on your cost. You pulled out your headphones and got up, as you deliberated if you should take you’re laptop with you. They wouldn’t steal it, would they?“We won’t steal it. We’ll watch it for you.” The blond hunk in front of you suddenly answers your unasked question. He had pulled up his hoodie, so you could see his face. He smiled. Cute.“Isn’t that exactly what a thief would say?” That earned you a chuckle from the man beside blonde-beauty.“You should leave your coffee anyways. Somebody could’ve put something in it. A dame should never leave her drink unattended. “Blonde-Beauty answered with an annoyed side- glance to the man next to him, who also shed his hood.“If we’re spitting out wisdom today,” you sat back on your seat,” only assholes wear sunglasses inside.”“I’d rather be an asshole than deal with everything else.” The dark-haired man snorts.  Blondies head snaps to his friend.“And what would you be dealing with? The burden of sight?  The unreasonable awareness of your surroundings? Or are you afraid everyone will get lost in your eyes, prettyboy?” You tease, smiling.Now your friends scolded you for being rude to strangers.  Fuck them. It’s flirting. They couldn`t even see the two brick walls of men sitting in front of you.“I don’t know, you tell me.” The dark-haired man said, leaned forward onto the table and took off his sunglasses. Like he was proving a point. There was no lying. He was utterly beautiful. And yes, maybe you could call the grey-blue eyes getting-lost-worthy.  “Buck…” Blondie tensed, watching his friend, also haven taken off his sunglasses.  Also very pretty, also very getting-lost-worthy blue eyes.Before you could answer your friends were starting to say goodbye on your laptop and you quickly waved them off.  “Personally, I have a soft spot for blue eyes, so maybe you should put them back on.” You smiled. “As an apology for busting in on your one on one, do you want another coffee? My treat.”The men looked somewhat shocked.“Ähm ...” Blondie blushed, “You don’t have to we …”“But I want to.” Yo
