Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Erik had been warned, to be fair.  The realtor was very explicit that the last seventeen tenants had run from the premises screaming about the Exorcist or The Ring or some other terrible horror show.Erik had promised her he didn't scare easily and he had run his hands over the smooth wood of the banisters and cabinets, enjoyed the sunlight streaming through the windows.  The wood floors with the old oriental rugs reminded him of his mother's--what little he can remember of it in Germany.  It feels enough like home in a way his apartments never have that within ten minutes he's decided he likes it enough to endure the commute into the city."You signed the paperwork?" Emma asks, lifting an eyebrow at him and walking through the house in her Jimmy Choos (silver and sparkling--Erik thinks no one has appreciated what Lady Gaga has done for fashion more than Emma), shedding her blazer and then planting a hand on her hips.  "Erik, it's a million and five degrees in here, tell me it has central air.""It would ruin the character of the house," he tells her, and she gives him the look she's always given him when he's been stupider than she cares to elucidate."Well, Azazel should love it," she sighs, and Erik glances at the front door where Azazel seems to be on his fifteenth Hail Mary."He thinks it's haunted," Emma supplies.  Erik makes a face and pulls Azazel in by his belt buckle."You dick," Azazel mutters. "Why you buy this fuckin' place?  Is evil.""It's charming," Emma decides, and Azazel flips her off, tells her not to be a contrary bitch in Russian."It's fucking haunted," is Janos' opinion when he comes downstairs.  "You bought a house filled with the dead.""Surely not filled," Erik protests mildly, settling in the sinfully comfortable recliner."Yeah, I see you at the funeral," Janos says flatly, and reaches his hand out to catch Azazel's."That smell's going to be a bitch to get out," Emma says as she drapes herself artfully on the couch.  In another life Emma should have been making money off of her looks, the way she can capture everyone's attention.  Could have been Hollywood or on the runways of Paris or Milan but instead she's here with him, working the CIA's Mutant Division and trying just as hard as he is to pretend that she doesn't have scars that run so deep she's not sure she can hold herself together.Emma was the first person he--well.  Emma was the first person he didn't punch in the face, not because she was a girl but because she went diamonds and he wasn't an idiot, even at nine.  She had literal edges and he wasn't going to cut himself on them if he could help it.She kept reading his mind in classes, answering questions before he said anything--even before he wanted to say anything, and he had detached the metal bands from the pencils and flung them at her.When it became clearer that Shaw's methods of teaching were trial by fire at best and sadistic at worse, they had stayed up and watched the sky and tried to pretend that everything was okay: that Emma's dad was going to come back, was going to read her letters and care that she was getting hit, forced to hurt the other children, forced to stay awake for hours so that their teacher could see how it affected her; that Erik's aunts gave a shit.It had helped, in a way.  They were certainly terrifying, and by the time they were sophomores they were at the top of Shaw's food chain, his pets and chosen, and if Emma shook at night, furious, jingling a little as she sat in diamond mode, convinced that Shaw could break through locks Erik had wound tight, no one mentioned it.Janos had come along their junior year, Emma's first boyfriend who liked his clothes just so and told her (allegedly) that she was good, for a girl, but perhaps he was looking for more penis in his life.Erik liked that kind of style and despite Emma's fiercest eye-rolls, Janos stayed.Azazel had just been useful, came as a package with Janos, but more than that he wasn't American, knew what it was like to be so alone in such a strange country. They taught each other their mother tongues and Erik tried to teach him Hebrew but Azazel was Roman Catholic and Emma ended up having to separate them, screaming at each other in Hebrew and Latin.They had grown up together, the four of them, and when Erik decided that he had finally hit his hard limits the year after their technical senior year, they followed him.(Shaw's tactical error was always Erik, and sometimes Erik wonders at that.  Genocide was never an option--his mother had taken him to Holocaust museums and his father had told him to be proud to be German and Jewish: that they had survived and still lived in their country--Erik wouldn't be a party to genocide, wouldn't have been able to endure the thought of his parents' disappointment.)Shaw had been forced underground when they exposed him (weak, injured, but not dead, and none of them had felt safe, really), and they burned him hard enough that he went off-
