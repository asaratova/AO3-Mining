Chapter 1: The Forgotten Prince
    




Chapter Text
Asgard  Many Years BeforeThe princes stormed through the palace.Well, the elder, Thor, stormed. It would be more accurate to say his twin, Loki, stalked. He was a smooth and silent shadow behind Thor’s blustering presence.“Father!” Thor boomed.Loki seized his brother’s vambrace urgently. “Thor, now is not-”“Father!”The king, Odin, turned away from his counselors with a scowl. “What is it?” he snapped. “This is a very tense time-”“Father, we must not let this insult to Asgard stand,” Thor rapped out, gesturing effusively at nothing in particular. “The Kree have disrespected us one too many times! And on top of this latest wound, they have attacked our military outpost the day before the peace treaty was to be signed!”Loki stepped to the side to force Thor to look at him. “Brother, listen. You have no proof that it was sanctioned by their government-”“Enough, Loki! This peace treaty was your idea, and it has failed! You are naught but an obstruction to the throne! Father, please. Let me lead an assault on their home planet-”“How can you expect to be a good diplomat if you can’t even be bothered to recall the name of a people’s homeworld?” Loki said, voice forceful yet deceptively polite.Odin held up a hand. “Enough. Thor, you’ve made your position clear. Loki, your judgment?”Loki straightened and ordered his thoughts. “There is no reason this attack should cause Asgard to break off negotiations with the Kree. It is well-known that they have many militarized tribes on the outskirts of their cities who answer to no government. There is already a clause in the peace treaty which would require the Kree oligarchy to actively challenge those groups and contain their assaults on Asgardian outposts and civilians alike. As there is no evidence whatsoever linking the attack to an official Kree military unit, it seems most prudent to sign the treaty and ensure the oligarchy knows that they will be expected to punish all future attacks. As it is, their army has been stretched too thin fighting our own to focus on the anarchic tribes, which pose a much lesser threat to the stability of the Kree society.”“Tis ridiculous,” Thor snarled. “That we should let this go unpunished - Father! You’re not considering this proposal-”“I am not,” Odin said, looking down his nose at Loki. No mean feat, given that Loki himself was several handswidths taller. “Loki, you make note of several salient points, yet Thor is correct. The insult is too grave.”“For a military unit unattached to the government and unbound by the cease-fire to attack an outpost of the army that has been on Kree soil fighting them for a century and a half? Really? That’s a grave insult?”“Their motives matter not,” Odin growled. “We cannot tolerate any attack on Asgard’s army whatsoever. Loki, I suggest you go speak with the Kree delegation. Thor, come with me, we must begin planning the invasion…”The king led his elder son away, toward his other warriors. Among them were several high-level generals, Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three. Sif and the Warriors smirked at Loki; clearly, they’d overheard some part of the argument.Loki didn’t let any of his fury and indignation show on his face as he gave them a cool nod and strode out of the throne room. This was ridiculous. Who had solved the baelor’s riddle and saved all their hides when Hogun dragged them into that cave in search of a treasure that didn’t exist? Who had rallied Thor’s friends when the golden prince himself fell to the poisoned barbs of the alken on Vanaheim, and led the battle against it? Who had saved their lives from the bilgesnipe that Thor and Volstagg woke on a dare from Fandral by casting an illusion that enticed it off a cliff? Loki. He could match any of them in battle and was one of the most powerful seidr masters in living history, trained by Frigga herself. And he was a prince of Asgard, one of two heirs to the throne. Yet they cast him aside as if his opinion mattered no more than that of an illicit peasant raised in the far reaches of Midgard’s poles! He registered that his icy demeanor was causing people to dodge out of his way in the hallways, and took a moment of brief and vicious pleasure from it. He was not well liked and less understood, here in Asgard’s palace, the one member of the elite warrior class who was lean and fast rather than blunt and forceful and bound in muscles. Loki almost snorted. He was in excellent shape and could run far longer, move far faster, than Thor. He much preferred his own build.Even if it got him shunned.He braced himself as he approached the palace wing reserved for visiting ambassadors. It was a gesture of respect for him to visit them personally rather than summoning the Kree ambassador and his retinue to Loki’s personal audience chamber. They’d take it as rudeness, mockery perhaps, that he had come here only to throw the gesture in their faces with the denial of the peace treaty. It was better than summ
