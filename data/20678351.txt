Chapter 1: Peter has a bad day.
    




Chapter Text
CHAPTER ONE:Peter walked into the Avengers tower heading for the elevator. Friday greeted him, “Hello, Peter. How was school?” Peter sighed, “Fine. Friday. Take me home.” The elevator started to move toward the penthouse where Peter lived with his adoptive father. 	The elevator opened and Peter walked into the open concept living room area. He kicked off his shoes, and threw his backpack on the ground as he walked. He went straight to his room slamming the door and falling onto his bed. Peter didn’t want to run into his makeshift family because they would immediately know that something was wrong and he really didn’t want to talk about it. Peter had only been adopted recently and he wasn’t sure of his place yet, and he didn’t want to rock the boat too much. But he was allowed to have a bad day, right?First he had woken up late for school and hadn’t had time to eat a good breakfast. He needed to eat more than an average teenager because of his enhanced metabolism so he was starving until lunch where Flash had stolen his lunch money from him. Peter couldn’t very well fight back because then Flash would figure out about his…Abilities. Then Peter had a history test which he had surely failed from lack of studying due to late nights out patrolling, and a lack of attention because of the fact that he was feeling light headed from a lack of food. He hadn’t wanted to call Mr. Stark to ask him to bring him food or money though because then he’d find out about Flash and Peter wasn’t sure what he’d do with that information. Peter also didn’t like asking for things because the kid who had lost everyone was still anxious that Mr. Stark would change his mind and figure out a way to get rid of him. So up until this point Peter hadn’t rocked the boat, but today. Today Peter didn’t care because today was a bad day and he deserved to be crabby and that was that. “Peter,” Friday interrupted his thoughts. “The boss wants you to put your shoes and backpack away.” Peter sighed and stomped out to the living room and hung his backpack on the hook it goes on and put his shoes on the shelf by the door. Peter looked at Mr. Stark who was working on something on his computer in the living room, “Happy?” He asked clearly frustrated. Tony raised an eyebrow at this. Peter wasn’t normally confrontational or rude. He set down his computer on the couch and stood up and walked toward where Peter had disappeared in his room. He knocked on the door and Peter yelled, “Go away.” Tony nodded. The kid was in a mood today. “How about we talk about whatever has you in a tizzy Spider-baby?”Peter opened the door, “I’m not a baby, and I don’t want to talk about anything right now. Can I just get some space to breathe. Geez.” Tony started to walk away but then turned back. “You can have space. All you have to do is ask for it, but not in that disrespectful tone. I suggest you find a way to be more pleasant before Pepper comes over.” Peter frowned. He knew he should pull back he didn’t care. “I’m not planning to be here anyway. I’m going to patrol and then I’m going to Ned’s. I may even just sleep there tonight because I can’t deal with you trying to tell me what to do tonight.” That was it. Tony saw red. “Listen Kid. You aren’t going anywhere. In fact you can do your homework, have dinner and go to bed. No Spider-manning until you can figure out how to deal with your emotions better.” “Oh like you do?"  Peter snapped back. “You’re supposed to be better than me!” Tony sighed and counted to ten, “I’m going to be the grown up and walk away kid. I don’t want to fight about this. Do your homework and come out for dinner at six.” Tony walked away to his lab. Peter felt tears burning his eyes, but didn’t let them fall. He hadn’t cried since Uncle Ben had died. He didn’t even cry when Aunt May had died in a car wreck. Peter looked at his computer knowing he should start to work on his paper that was due this week, but Peter didn’t care. He changed into some basketball shorts, tennis shoes, and a t-shirt with a science pun on it. He walked to the elevator and went down to the gym. Peter started the treadmill and ran until he started to see black spots in front of his eyes. He went for the basket of protein bars, fruit, and granola bars that Mr. Stark kept on the counter for him in case he over did it and didn’t fuel his body properly. He ate three granola bars, and a apple and went back upstairs. Pepper was upstairs when he came inside, and he slid by down the hallway off the kitchen heading to his bedroom to shower. He showered and changed into sweats and a shirt. He went into the living room turning on the TV and started to watch a movie.Tony came up from the lab and found Peter watching tv. “You’re grounded. Turn the TV off. Did you do your homework?” Peter shrugged and made no move to turn off the tv. “Friday. Turn the TV off.” Tony asked. “Yes. Boss.” Friday responded cheerfully. Peter turned to glare at h
