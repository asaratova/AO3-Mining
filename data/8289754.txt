Chapter Text
So Tony drank after he promised to himself and more important, Pepper not to.He drank for twenty five years of blaming Howard.He drank for falling for the honey trap named Steve Rogers.He drank for a relationship with Peggy Carter, that went to god-knows-where because Rogers suddenly showed up. He drank for messed up fathers.He drank for Jarvis (or JARVIS), the only reason for not being dead yet.He drank for a war that Rogers began for Barnes without thinking about the consequenses.And so did Howard.
