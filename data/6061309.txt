Chapter 1





Chapter Text

Everyone reacts to the stress of life-threatening situations differently. Darcy had been exposed to various near-death experiences, but the first time someone directly influenced one of those crises in her favor, she discovered how she, Darcy Lewis, reacted to that kind of thing.


He picked up the car, swung it through the air, and crushed a murderous group of Dark Elves. Darcy turned to blink at him, her jaw falling open.


“You… saved my life!”


He looked a little surprised himself, but eventually agreed: “Yeah…”


And even though the battle wasn’t over and they weren’t yet out of danger, she kissed him.
