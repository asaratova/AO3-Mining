Chapter 1: Part I
    




Chapter Text
“Left flank, Spangles,” Tony drawled laconically over the comms as he soared past the embattled Avenger below.  Twisting in mid-air, he shot at a street lamp, toppling it on the creature poised to leap on Steve’s back, and twisting again, he fired at the traffic light, making it fall on his own pursuer.   And having shook off his pursuer, he resumed taking out the flyers. JARVIS crisply alerted him to a pair of stranded civilians.  Angling himself in that direction, he shot a couple of diversionary charges at the creatures before landing, ensuring he had the…things full attention as he landed some feet away from the terrified civilians.   Inside his suit, he smirked tiredly.  Naturally everyone wanted a piece of the one and only Tony Stark—genius, playboy, philanthropist billionaire with the deadly good looks. His sharp, crisp movements belying his tiredness, Tony fired a missile straight down the gullet of the gaping maw, then shifted smoothly to direct another blast into the face of the one trying to jump him.  The scream it gave drowned out JARVIS’ calm advice to the people to run….like hell. Which they did.Once he saw them take refuge in the nearby firehouse, he launched himself back into the air to resume his mission of taking out the flyers.Because he so rarely allowed people to see past the carefully crafted image of nonchalance, many people erroneously believed Tony Stark—notorious playboy extraordinaire—truly didn’t take anything seriously, that the world was just a vast entertainment studio strictly for his amusement.   Even worse, they thought Iron Man was nothing more than another toy for the playboy.  Too much time and money on his hands that had found another new indulgence.Those people were so very wrong, as so many of his enemies found to their cost.  Tony was all that, and more.  He would be the first to cheerfully admit that he played hard.  And he would be the very last person to confess that he worked even harder, taking his duties as an Avenger, as a Stark—with a deadly seriousness that would shock his enemies. And hundreds of charities would be shocked that their mysterious benefactor that poured money into their coffers, that allowed them to help and/or expand their program was none other than Mr. Tony Stark.  But they would never know the man they spoke about so disparagingly in the public due to his spendthrift way simply because Tony didn’t do what he did for publicity.What people failed to realize—because Tony played the reckless, shallow playboy so well—was that he was a good man.  Three was the number of people that saw behind the careless, insouciance mask he wore…Rhodey, Pepper and Natasha.  And Natasha knew one thing—armed with money, power, charisma, and most damning of all, influence—Tony Stark was easily one of the most dangerous men on the planet. Natasha thought him a dangerous fool because truly good men such as Tony and Captain America had a tendency to die too soon; Pepper saw Tony as an angel come down to Earth (though she made damn sure he never got an inkling of that whimsical thought or he would have mocked her forever!).   As Rhodey had been his friend for over twenty years, there wasn’t much about Tony that surprised him.   However, another person was slowly coming to a similar conclusion about Tony.  During the failed Chitauri invasion, Steve saw a decidedly different person than the one he initially met on the helicarrier.  Like Natasha, he knew that appearances were often very deceptive.  Tony had proved him wrong once, so he had no intention of making that same mistake.But it was hard not to smack that manic grin off Tony’s face sometimes, the man was so exasperatingly voluble…he never stopped talking and treated everything like it was one big fat joke.Like now…Tony maintained a certain insouciance that made it seem like the attacking creatures were no more dangerous than a mewling kitten instead of the mad howling, voracious walking pig-like creatures.  They had already eaten several of New York’s finest, critically wounded several more firemen and civilians alike and were now busily trying to do the same with the rest of the people caught on the street.     And since the Avengers were vehemently opposed to that idea, the strange creatures were slowly being decimated. Ow, ow, ow, Steve thought wearily even as he absentmindedly smashed his shield into the face of one of the creatures leaping at him.  Tucking into a forward roll to leap upon the roof of a parked car, he used his position as a temporary staging point.Gaining a momentary breather, he gave his surroundings a measured look.  In all fairness, this particular battle harder and, strangely enough, easier as the ground creatures had been accompanied by the flyers. Unfortunately, the Avengers only had two people with flying capability, thus had the harder job of taking out their newly arrived guests. On the flip side…the flyers were more than happy to take a bite
