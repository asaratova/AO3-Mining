Life, Tony reflected sedately, was a very twisty lifey wifey ball of suck. Tony had expected things to calm down after he had assuaged his conscience and cleaned up the messes left behind by overly emotional superheroes who appeared terminally incapable of thinking of the consequences of their actions, in the form of keeping Ross’s very slimy hands off of Lang’s and Barton’s families. And, while Tony’s life at the hands of his Three Furies, Laura Barton/Bowman, Maggie Lang, and Pepper Potts, had been nothing but smooth in the aftermath of the war he had waged with Steve Rogers over the Sokovia accords, Tony had to admit he wasn’t quite dealing with everything the way that he necessarily should be. Sleeping in the newly renovated Compound meant that the newly installed FRIDAY wasn’t able to snitch about his nightmares or panic attacks to the Unholy Trinity as often. It also meant, though, that Paxton was keeping an eye on him and reporting everything back to his lady and mistress, Tisiphone Fury of Avenging Murder, torturer of the damned. AKA, Maggie Lang. If Laura Barton/Bowman rode him to take care of himself and everything else besides, Maggie Lang made sure Tony’s feet stayed firmly planted on the good earth.Where Laura used her kids to force Tony to be a Responsible Human Being™, Maggie frequently forced him to do his work for the Ho Yinsen Academy that had been set up by him as her stipulation for uprooting herself to the East Coast with her husband and child. She was essentially the principal of the institution, but he was still apparently the Chairman. She forced him to look at the reality that he had kids in the tower, that their lives needed to be on the up and up, and that he had to confront his feelings, both about the fact that there were kids everywhere and that he was a human being with actual emotions who was suffering from some very unfortunate spates of stuff.Paxton was her enforcer.Tony regretted getting them jobs already.Okay, that wasn’t true, but still.The nightmares and panic attacks had gotten less problematic since the two families had moved into the tower and kids had started becoming a part of his daily life. He wasn’t quite sure how he felt about “Uncle Tony” status, either from the Barton Brood or from little Cassie Lang, but he couldn’t resist the power of the doe eyes, so he had decided to shut up about it and teach them the wonders of science. Parents, it turned out, were not happy when lab explosions resulted in their children being covered head to toe in completely non-toxic completely edible red goo. Tony still got to be the Cool Uncle, though, so it was worth it.The Parker kid had also been coming by more, still just as snarky and eager to please, but some of the star shine seemed to be fading, which was a good thing, in Tony’s opinion. He had been oddly brotherly to the tykes, especially when they were all over at the Compound some nights. Peter kept his mask up, though, especially since T’Challa was a little shutterbug.Tony knew quite well where those photos were going, but Tony had gotten nothing from Rogers, and Tony certainly wasn’t going to call the man baring life at large going even more pear shaped than it already was. Tony did hope, though, that Barton and Lang got some measure of peace from knowing that their families were safe.But, still, Tony’s life felt like it had turned into some sort of Brady Bunch Episode, all wholesome family interaction. And between Harley and Peter and all the younger kids, Tony almost felt weirdly like some crazy type of family patriarch. The thought gave him hives, but it was what it was. Or at least, that was what he told himself as he stared up at the ceiling because he couldn’t sleep without feeling the chill of Siberia, hear Roger’s shield crash into his heart, or taste his blood in his mouth.Tony sighed and resolved to go work it off in the workshop, getting out of bed and putting on something more substantial than his birthday suit.“Burning the midnight oil, Boss?” FRIDAY asked, her voice filled with concern. While just as snarky as JARVIS had been, most days, she was far more open with her other emotions. Tony wondered, idly, if that was Pepper’s influence.“Can’t sleep. Hopefully getting some work done will put my brain to bed.” Tony replied.FRIDAY let out an audible sigh, “What should we work on tonight, then? Maybe a BARF simulation would help you get through things?”Tony paused. He knew that if he didn’t take FRIDAY up on her offer, she would be snitching to the Unholy Trinity in the morning. Hell, she would probably do that regardless, little well-meaning rat that she was. Tony nodded, though, and turned to the simulation room rather than the shiny new workshop. Tony slipped on the BARF interface, “Take it away, gal FRIDAY.”“Sure thing, Boss. Initiating ‘Brain Playlist Alpha.’” FRIDAY said, her voice soft.Slowly, the room reoriented itself, his memories playing out for him, spinning through various images as he w
