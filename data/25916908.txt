Chapter Text
It was supposed to be a quick in and out mission. Get in, gather intel, destroy the base, and get out. They did not expect for it to be a rescue mission at all, not until Natasha turns a corner and catches a glimpse of a small figure behind a glass panel. “Five minutes, Nat,” Natasha hears through her comms, and she hums, aiming her gun at two men heading towards the cell before they could raise theirs. “Bringing out a captive, Cap, give me a sec,” Natasha stalls, firing her gun again, this time against the digital lock of the cell and stepping inside. The sound brings the child down on the ground, and curls into a tighter ball when Natasha steps closer. “Safe.” Natasha tells the child gently, but with a firm urgency. Basing simply on the shaved head, she immediately assumes the child as a small boy, and looks to be no older than four. She sees him flinch when he hears more gunshots from not too far away, too used to white noise and he immediately panics, not necessarily knowing just yet what to do with an intruder attack. Natasha attempts to move forward again, and feels slight relief when he doesn’t inch away.“We can’t stay here, the facility is set to go down in a few minutes. I need to carry you out, alright?” Natasha manages to get out, not waiting for a response before scooping the small child in her arms and running towards the nearest way out.“What the hell is that, Red?” Tony asks incredulously at the sight of the Black Widow carrying a trembling child in her arms. “I’m sure you know what a child looks like,” Natasha comments as she steps into the Quintjet in record time, already hovering away just as the facility goes up in flames. “HYDRA’s been keeping this bit quiet,” Natasha looks down to get a better look at the child, and she fights back a frown at the confusion and fear the child’s wide eyes held. She notices brown patches of stubble starting to grow, and the dirtied smock he was wearing. Natasha sets him down on his feet, not letting go of his shoulders until he could stand steadily. Steve shuffles close, kneeling down to the child’s level and he immediately tenses up, not knowing what to expect. “Hey, buddy,” Steve starts, and he shrinks into himself a fraction but manages to stand his ground. “I’m Steve, and this is Natasha. Can you tell us your name?” The child simply stares past his gaze. “We can find it out for you and if not, I’m sure you can pick out what you’d like to be called. Would you like that?” The child still looks at him blankly, hearing his words but not at all comprehending. He takes a step back, his hand absently grasping at the fabric of Nat’s suit. When Natasha shifts to kneel, he takes it as a rejection and quickly lets go of her pant leg. “Sorry!” He gasps out, balling his little fists to the side and hunching his shoulders up to his ears. To his surprise, he feels the lightest touch going up and down his forearm, and he cracks an eye open to see that it was Natasha, giving him a small, earnest smile. “It’s okay,” Natasha soothes, and he relaxes slightly, his nails no longer digging into his palms but he keeps them closed. “There we go.” Steve feels a bit out of place now. “We’re the good guys, yeah? You’re not going back there anymore.” The child doesn’t respond after that, the concept too foreign for him to grasp. He does, however, think back to the warmth that surrounded him when he was being held against the woman’s—Natasha’s—chest, and his little mind reels, wanting to feel that sensation again, but knows better than to ask for it. As they land the jet, he’s surprised when he feels himself being lifted up and holds back a smile when he meets Natasha’s eyes. “I’ll have to clean you up, is that alright?” Natasha asks quietly, and he nods, keeping his arms clipped against his chest as Natasha carries him down and into the compound.The child doesn’t protest when Natasha eventually puts him down, shivering slightly at the cold tiles of the bathroom floor. She removes his clothing and quickly realizes that he is a she, her lack of hair and slightly gaunt face giving the illusion of boyishness.Natasha makes quick but gentle work to scrub her down, taking note of the scars that reveal themselves on her skin as she continues to slough off the dirt and grime. She changes her in one of her shirts, and she has Friday order a week’s worth of clothing and supplies for the meantime. “He needs to see Cho, or Bruce, at least,” Steve mentions once she sees the two of them emerge from the bathroom. “At this point, I don’t even want to know what HYDRA’s planning to do with him.” “First of all, she needs some food,” Natasha says, maneuvering around him to get to the kitchen, leaving the little girl hovering awkwardly by the bathroom door. Natasha looks down and cocks her head. “Come on. It’s okay.” Steve watches the child—the little girl—pad tentatively towards her direct
