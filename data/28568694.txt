Part One of a Two Chapter Set Posted On January 5th, 2021. Chapter 1:“So this is the mighty Thor? I’m underwhelmed.”“Well, then you better get whelmed, vile creature!”The golden-hair of Thor flowed about as flawlessly as his punches down onto the dome of a large troll beast. The God of Thunder could not recall off hand when this battle had started. All Thor cared about was a good scrap, and this troll offered it, as trolls tended to do.The Troll, in no mood for the sophisticated art of knuckle brawling, hoisted up his club and bellowed. Thor dodged the wild swing from the club. The golden-haired Asgardian introduced his knuckles into the forehead of the troll and caused him to smash down onto the ground.A flying rock received a blunt force from Mjolnir.  Electricity rattled around Thor. The troll grunted and charged Thor. The two exchanged punches with Thor getting the better of the exchange. A swinging double axe handle to the top of the head rammed the troll down to his knees and took him out of the battle. When there was one troll, there were likely more. Two other nasty creatures charged forward and made their attempts to go at Thor. Thor dispatched one of the trolls by hoisting said troll up in the air and tossing the foul beast from afar. The other troll grabbed Thor and tousled with him.The troll’s foul breath immobilized Thor for only seconds. Thor smashed into the chest.“There is a lovely invention on Midgard called a breath mint. I suggest you look into one.”Thor blocked the troll’s foul breath with a well-placed fist to the mouth. Another loud crack and the creature crumpled underneath Thor’s assault. Thor ripped the fist from the mouth and broke out into a smile. Which only widened when more trolls charged.A figure dropped down from behind and smashed one of the trolls down to the ground. Thor smiled and viewed the dark-haired maiden rush into battle. She slid underneath the swing of the club which almost took her head off before coming back around. The woman smashed into the face of the troll.“You had a scrap with these trolls, and did not invite me? I’m hurt, Thor.”“Ah, Lady Sif, so nice to see you,” Thor said. “Let us send these foul beasts packing.”“Yes! Let’s!”The leader of the trolls rose up to his feet and he was fuming. No one could ever have an even angrier look upon their faces, that at the same time, made them look even more angry. “You will fall at my feet, Asgardian!”The troll bellowed and rushed Thor. Thor did not back down. The troll’s brutish attempts did little to phase the God of Thunder. Thor smashed down upon the troll and knocked the creature around. Shot after shot rocked the troll until Thor swung for the fences and bashed Mjolnir down upon  the creature's head.Sif finished rocking the rest of the trolls with a vicious series of attacks. One smashed face first into the ground and she bounced up. The moment Sif stood up, the other trolls got the hint. “Well, they eventually understood they were foolish to pick a fight at that,” Sif responded. “Why were they here?”“Your guess is as good as mine. I think one of them just saw that I passed and decided to make a name for himself. And it just escalated from there.”A moment passed, and Thor leaned towards  Sif who smiled. There was nothing like a good scrap which really got the blood pumping and perhaps opened the door for other activities.“How about a drink to celebrate our victory?” Thor inquired.“I would be delighted.”“And there I was, with my fellow Avengers. We had our backs against the wall, as the Chimera had been summoned. We fought boldy and valiantly, and managed to fight the creature. Our brave efforts summoned the architect of this vile beast and it was only the one and only, the infamous Morgan le Fay. Who, as it turned out, had been trying to use the Avengers as bait to draw out her once lover and associate, Doctor Doom.”The people at the bar, including Sif, sat around. Sif would have preferred a much more intimate get together with Thor, but perhaps the moment would pass.“Now, we stopped her vile plan, although it was a blow to the ego to be nothing but a pawn in such a glorious game between two chessmasters. There would be other times where I would encounter Doom. Normally, he does battle with the quartet of heroes known as the Fantastic Four, but given how world-shattering the maniac’s plans tend to be, we have had a quarrel with him a time or two.”Thor drew in breath and everyone hung on his every word. “And now, let me tell you about the time where the pizza delivery man was replaced by a Skrull. Which had been the harbinger of an alien invasion which had….”A glorious tune began to play in the bar which caught Thor’s attention. “Ah, it appears that someone from Midgard appears to have contacted me. I do hope it is not those fine folks from Microsoft again, claiming that there is something wrong with my Windows. I keep assuring them they have not been shattered or damaged in any way.”R
