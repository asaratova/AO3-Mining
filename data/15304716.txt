---One Hour After the Accident---Everything feels surreal, like Peter is stuck in some twisted, messed up dream. His senses are dialed up to triple digits, but it’s like they’re only registering certain things, and filtering the rest out. He can here the squeaking of the gurney wheels on the floor of the compound. He can feel his heart beating fast enough to kill him. He can see his feet pounding against the ground as he chases the gurney. But that’s all he registers. The rest of the world is completely black.The gurney turns into a room. Peter swerves to follow, but hands catch him, hold him back. He looks up and finds himself staring into Rhodey’s face. There are tears on it. Only then does Peter realize he’s crying, too.“Let me past,” he tells Rhodey. He’s surprised by how calm his voice is, all things considered. But there’s a dangerous edge to the words, one that Nat would be proud of.“You did a great job today, Peter,” Rhodey says, not moving out of the way. “Kid, Tony would be . . . Tony is so proud of you. But you have to let Bruce and Strange work their magic, no pun intended.”“He’d want me in there!” Peter says, and his voice rises to a yell. “Kid,” says Rhodey, and there’s more pain in his voice than Peter’s ever heard. “He can’t make that call right now.” ---Ten Years Before The Accident---The call comes for Uncle Ben at 8:48 PM, EST. It must be Ben’s boss or something, because Ben gets really white and pulls May out into the hall.Peter watches them from the keyhole. He’s worried; May is crying. Ben is crying too, and after a while they stop talking and just hold each other. That’s when Peter knows everything will be okay, because May and Ben love each other in a way that even his parents don’t.Speaking of his parents, they’ll be home soon, Peter thinks. Ben said they boarded their flight a few hours ago. They might even be back in time to listen to Ben read him a bedtime story.May comes in after a few minutes. She’s doing that thing she does, where she pretends she wasn’t upset for Peter’s sake. He appreciates the gesture in theory; when May cries, he tends to cry. But there’s no point lying to him, because he saw her and he knows something is wrong.“Ben’s going out for a little while,” May tells him. Her gaze has so much love in it. She looks at him in a way that no one else does. His mom doesn’t even look at him like that, but that’s not his mom’s fault. She’s really busy, with her whole science career and everything.“Okay,” Peter says. He wants to protest, because Ben hasn’t read him a bedtime story and no one can read like Ben can. But May is upset. So he can handle going to bed without finding out what Harry and Ron and Hermione are doing.He waits up for Ben, and for his parents too. May must be really upset, because she doesn’t tell him to go to bed, not even when the clock reaches eleven. Half an hour later, the door opens. It’s Ben, and he’s looking more tired than Peter has ever seen him. May jumps to her feet, shaking slightly. Ben nods at her, his eyes brimming with tears, and May sniffs and drifts restlessly into the kitchen, away from them.“Hey, Pete,” says Ben, moving over to the couch. “I brought you a present.”Peter is tired. His eyes feel really heavy, but he looks over at Ben anyway. Ben pulls an Iron Man mask out of his backpack. It’s not a real one, of course, but its super cool, and it looks pretty realistic considering its plastic.“Thanks, Ben!” Peter reaches out and slides it over his face with shaking hands. He feels better, once it’s on. Iron Man is so cool.“There’s something I need to tell you, Peter,” Ben says. He reaches out and grabs Peter’s hands in his own. “They’re dead. Aren’t they?” is all Peter says.Peter is a really smart kid, and he knows all about death from the time he found his fish floating upside down in the bowl. He thinks he’s known what happened for a while. Hours, even. Maybe ever since Ben got that call. But it’s only after he puts on the mask that he can be brave about it. Because what would Iron Man do in a situation like this? ---Two Hours After The Accident---In situations like this, the helplessness is overwhelming. Peter paces back and forth in the hallway outside the medlab. People drift past. The doctors and nurses don’t pay him much mind. One stops and tries to stitch up the gaping wound on his forehead, but Peter shoves the hands away.Peter’s wearing SI sweatpants and a tee-shirt. He’s not entirely sure when he changed, or what happened to his suit. The past few hours are a complete blur, like he’s trapped in the middle of a tornado.Rhodey and Pepper are hovering somewhere near him. They talk in low voices for a while, glancing at him every now and then. Peter doesn’t care. He can’t find it in himself to respond when they try to talk to him. He just walks back and forth along the hallway, trying not to think.The rest of the Avengers drift in and out. Nat is the only one who talks to him. She brings him hot chocolate and forces h
