Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 “Let’s just go home.”
“You are inviting me back to your apartment?”, Yelena asks, staring, confused.
“You still live there.”, Kate says.
“After everything that was said, you still want me there? After I told you about all of the secrets I have kept from you— that I still keep from you?”
“They’re not secrets, Yelena. You just set boundaries. There are things about your past you’re not ready for me to know yet, and that’s okay.”
“And what if I never am ready for you to know? What if I never want you to know?”
“Then I’ll never ask.”
