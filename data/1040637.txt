Chapter 1: A Queen's Decision
    




Chapter Text
      “Are you certain of this, my queen?”      Frigga, queen of Asgard, pondered the question.  She had never been more assured of anything in her life, and considering how very long lived she was, that was remarkable.  She ran her fingers over the matched set of gold bracelets on the table before her, admiring their craftsmanship.  Made by dwarves, they were unbreakable in spite of their delicate appearance.  They were not solid, but designed like twisting golden vines, encrusted with tiny jewels on the leaves and engraved with runes on the stems.  They were lovely, but not made for adornment, for they had another purpose.  When she touched them, the spells laid upon them tickled her senses.      “It must be done, Hoenir.”  She spoke to the sorcerer standing to her left.  He stroked his neatly trimmed blond beard and said nothing, wise enough not to argue.      “I have let the men in my family do as they will, and see the impasse we have come to,” Frigga said.  “If I do nothing, my son is lost forever.”  She tapped both of the bracelets in turn.  “One will keep him from slipping further into the darkness.  The other is for the instrument of his redemption.”      “Who will wear the other bracelet?”  Hoenir asked.      The sorcerer knew better than to ask, as she never shared what she saw of the future, but the salvation of the disgraced second prince of Asgard was important to him too.  A slight smile graced the queen’s delicate lips.   “The unlikeliest creature imaginable.”
