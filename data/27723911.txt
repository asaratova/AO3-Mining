Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Hermione had been very proud to have been chosen to be a Prefect starting her fifth year. She didn’t know exactly who the other Prefects were, not Harry or Ron, but she didn’t care. All of her hard work had paid off and it was finally recognized. She couldn’t have been more proud to tell her parents when the letter came. Ron had been quite disappointed to find out he hadn’t gotten it, mostly because of the pressure his family put him under. Harry did not care much either way. He had not wanted the extra work that year, though the title would have been nice. 
‘I have to go. I’ll see you later.’ Hermione waved at her friends and left the train cabin to attend the first prefect meeting. She was excited to find out who the others were. She reached the cabin where the meeting would take place and quickly joined the rest. The other prefect from Gryffindor was Dean Thomas, which Hermione thought was right. He was a hardworking boy who took his education quite seriously. Hermione didn’t recognize the ones from Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw but was very surprised at the choice for Slytherin. The one person who had made her Hogwarts experience very challenging stood before her. Draco Malfoy. She couldn’t help but glare at him, suspecting Snape must have had a hand in this. 
The girl was Daphne Greengrass, whom she recognized only because her beauty stood out so prominently. She was most definitely the most popular girl in her House.
The meeting took a while and Hermione spend it listening and taking notes eagerly. She was surprised to see they all took it seriously, including the Slytherins. Not once did they make an inappropriate comment or insulted her heritage. Draco even sounded polite as he asked her to stay behind after the meeting. 
‘I just want to talk to you since we’re going to be working together a lot this year.’ The rest of the cabin was empty, only the two of them were left. Hermione was hesitant but she really couldn’t say no when he was the one extending the olive branch. 
‘Alright.’ She closed the door behind her but Draco immediately reached out and stopped her from doing so. ‘Oh no, that won’t be necessary.’ His lips turned up and formed a frightening, malicious grin. ‘Come on in, boys.’ Before Hermione could respond, a wand was pressed against her temple. ‘Imperio.’ 
‘Perfectly executed, Draco.’ Theo Nott walked into the cabin, followed by Gregory Goyle, Vincent Crabbe, and Adrian Pucey. Hermione couldn’t respond, she could barely comprehend what was happening. It was like her head had been invaded by a thick cloud, making it hard for her to think. All feelings of responsibility that she had felt so strongly only minutes before left her and were replaced by a tranquil sort of happiness. The boys stood in front of her, all of them with wicked smiles on their faces. 
Draco was the one who took the lead. ‘Hermione.’ He said and she immediately looked at him, tilting her head up since he was much taller than she was. ‘Take off your clothes.’ He demanded and Hermione didn’t think twice to obey. 
Her fingers deftly opened the buttons on her blouse one by one until it was opened fully and she slid out of it and let the fabric fall to the floor. Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Fold your clothes and put it on the seat. We’re not animals, Granger.’ 
Hermione picked the blouse up from the floor and put it neatly folded on the seat as she was told. ‘Resume your stripping.’ Draco said quickly, his eyes roaming all over her bare flesh. 
Her skirt soon joined her blouse and then only her underwear and stockings were left. ‘Please let her keep the stockings on.’ Goyle pleaded with Draco. Draco looked her up and down and nodded. 
‘Bra and panties off.’ Hermione unclasped her bra behind her back, pulled the cups down to reveal two perky breasts, and put it on the neat stack of clothes. Then her panties went down and she was left in only her stockings. Still, her mind was quite happy with everything that was happening.
The boys all looked at her naked body with lust-filled eyes. ‘She looks better than expected.’ Theo said, eyeing the girl critically. ‘I didn’t vouch for her without reason, Nott. I knew she was hiding a gorgeous little body underneath those baggy clothes.’ Draco grinned and reached out a hand to caress her soft breast. 
Draco slid out of his robes and opened his pants just enough to reveal a semi-hard cock. ‘How long until we reach Hogwarts?’ He asked no one in particular as he took his cock in his hand and started to pump himself hard. ‘About an hour.’ Adrian Pucey responded, rummaging around in his bag until he found what he was looking for. 
‘Get on your knees.’ Draco told Hermione, who immediately sank down to her knees before the one who had Imperiused her. ‘You’re going to please me, Hermione. Take my cock in your mouth and suck me.’ He held his cock in his hand, pushing against her lips until she opened up and let him in. 
Hermione had never given a blowjob before but somehow she
