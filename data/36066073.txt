Chapter 1: Quick Toothbrush
    


Notes:
So. this is. the opposite of "bucky thinks steve is his handler" just because. I was gonna tag it as such but it's not a drop down tag so I got skittish




Chapter Text
"Hey. Come in here." Bucky said.It was 20:00 if you were wondering."Where?" Steve came down the hall and shuffled his feet at the door."In here. Stand normal. Heels/shoulders." Bucky got Steve by the sink in the bathroom. He was going to take care of him. I wish that we could just freeze Steve Rogers until we need him, like leftover corn. You need a guy to squint at the horizon and put his hands on his hips, you can just pop him in the microwave. "Open up. Let me see 'em.""Ahh?" The situations."No making noise or that's it." Bucky said. The nerve on this guy. He stared at Steve's mouth for a while. You see, he has a right hand and a left hand. I just think after all this he's earned a third one, you know. He put his right hand on Steve's chin and I guess started brushing his teeth for him yep. I don't make the rules.Bucky feigned like he was gonna poke Steve in the eye with the other end of the brush, which got his feet back on the ground. It's just weirdly intimate? It's just weirdly, weirdly, weirdly, it's very important that this goes as normally as possible. "Sss. Spit." Bucky instructed, so Steve turned against the cabinet and spat into the sink. "That's fine." Bucky said. Thumbs up.
