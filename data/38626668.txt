Sometimes he’d wake up in the middle of the night. No rhyme, no reason, just fear. Even pleasant dreams could end in that: the cold emptiness of space, the desolate surface of the rock he’d been taken to, the way he’d known to agree or choose death.
“Loki?” A sleepy voice interrupted another one of these flashbacks, and the bed next to him shifted. “Are you okay?
He wanted to tell you that he was fine, that you could just go back to bed, but before he could, you must have seen his horrified expression.
“Was it another nightmare?” you asked.
“Not a nightmare,” Loki answered. He flicked a hand lethargically in the air. “Just…a feeling.”
You sat up and looked closely at him. “Is there anything I can do?”
“Hm,” Loki hummed gently and entwined his fingers with yours. “Just be with me, as much as you can.”
 In return, you smiled and squeezed his fingers. “It’s a promise.”
