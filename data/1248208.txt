Chapter 1: RE: Easter
    




Chapter Text
FAO: SHIELD levels 1-5; The Avengers
CC: Agent Coulson, Agent Hill
From: Director Fury
Subject: Easter PartyDear all,Just a reminder in advance of Easter this year, that due to the fiasco that was last year’s Easter party (and indeed all party’s we at SHIELD have ever held) there will be no office party.
I repeat, NO OFFICE PARTY. If I see a single agent not in their standard issue uniforms, a single egg, a single bunny, I will shoot first and ask questions later.You have been warned.

CC: Agent Hill
From: Agent Coulson
Subject: Re: Easter PartyDear Fury,I couldn’t help but notice you only e-mailed level 1-5 agents about not having an easter party. While I agree that due to the fact level 1-5 agents are generally deemed “Tony Starks minions” (whether due to their own blind idiocy or actual co-operation), and it is prudent to plan ahead for any of their misdeeds. I still feel I should inform you that the Level 7 Agents appear to planning something. Specifically the R&D department heads.I may or may not have seen a scatter gun designed for the mass deployment of chocolate eggs.It may or may not have been Starks idea.His influence may or may not be moving up the rankings.Much love, Coulson
P.S. are you still sure a Fish Tank would be too much for the Air Bus?-----FAO: Tony Stark
From Director Fury
Subject: -Dear Mr Stark,I don’t know what you are planning but I am on to you. I swear to god if I hear the words “Wanna gift? Why don’t you look in my sack and see what I’ve got for you.” One more time on my Hellicarrier I will have you scrubbing the deck with your toothbrush. Besides the obvious sexual harassment element of your continued “pranks”: a) the Easter bunny does not carry a sack b) it is the exact same catch phrase you used over the Christmas holidays. Come up with a new – No wait. Don’t. Just stop.I am so done with you.
