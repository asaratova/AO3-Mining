Chapter 1





Chapter Text
On the mornings when Clint was woken up early by a nightmare, he took himself outside to the range that was half-hidden in the trees behind the base to push it aside with the familiar rhythms of shooting. Some days it worked better than others. Today, it only took an hour or two before his mind was half on what he was doing and half on whether or not he should completely rebuild the porch at the farm, or if it just needed a new roof.Which was when he became aware that he was being watched.He let the arrow he had ready fly before turning to see who was there. At first glance, the figure dressed in baggy black clothes looked like a tramp. Clint was trying to work out how their security had got so lax that the homeless were just wandering onto the base when the sunlight glinted off a metal hand.He had an arrow notched and aimed before he'd even thought about it.The man was dressed in an over-sized hoodie with the hood pulled up over tangled dark hair but it only took Clint a moment to connect his face, his metal hand, and the surveillance photos that Steve and Sam kept leaving lying around as part of their on-going search for the Winter Soldier. Clint took a deep breath and reminded himself that killing Steve's childhood best friend was probably a bad idea, but he didn't relax his bow."Can I help?" he asked.The Winter Soldier held up his palms as if in surrender, but it was going to take more than that for Clint to stand down. He'd heard way too many horror stories about this guy. "I'm looking for Captain America," he said in a voice that sounded rusty and unused.Right. And last time he'd been looking for Steve, it had been so he could kill him. He didn't look particularly homicidal at the moment, but that didn't mean Clint was taking any chances."What do you want with him?" he asked.The Soldier shifted his weight on his feet and Clint tensed his arms, ready to fire. "I want to surrender to him."Okay, Clint wasn't expecting that. He held position for another few moments, searching the Soldier's face, then let out a sigh, lowering his bow. There was a look in the guy's eyes that he thought he recognised, both from when he'd first met Natasha, and when he'd looked in the mirror after Loki."You even look at him wrong, I'm not going to be the only one coming after you," he said. “We'll take you apart, legendary assassin or not.”The Soldier nodded. "Got it."Clint had to take one hand off his bow to pull his phone out of his pocket, which made him feel pretty vulnerable, but the Soldier just stood their patiently as Clint dialled Steve."Hi," he said when Steve picked up. "You might want to come out to my range. Got an old friend of yours here.""Who is it?" asked Steve.Clint snorted. "Come on, Steve. How many old friends do you have?"There was a pause, then Steve snapped, "Keep him there," and hung up.Clint tucked his phone back in his pocket. "He's on his way," he told the Soldier.The Winter Soldier gave a curt nod. Clint saw him take a deep breath, as if bracing himself, and wondered what it felt like to have to face your best friend after seventy years of being a brainwashed assassin, not to mention trying to kill him.Mind you, Clint's best friend was Natasha, who would probably just shrug and give Clint a shot of vodka. That was basically what she'd done after he'd spent three days as Loki's brainwashed assassin, after all, and he couldn't see another few decades changing that.Okay, so, she'd also hit him, but that was just her way of showing affection.They stood in silence for long enough for it to start to feel a bit awkward, then the Winter Soldier nodded towards Clint's arrow-studded bullseye."Good shot.""Yep," agreed Clint. "Kinda what I'm known for."The Winter Soldier's gaze focused over his shoulder and he took another deep breath, firming his shoulders. Clint assumed that Steve had come into view but didn't turn to look. Instead, he lifted his bow again, bracing himself."Stand down, Hawkeye," said Steve, coming up behind him.Code name, which meant he intended it as an order. Clint ignored him. If he let Captain America get gutted, Natasha would never let him hear the end of it. Also, it was probably treason or something.Steve walked past Clint and stopped a few metres away from the Winter Soldier. "Hi, Bucky."The Soldier stared at him for a long few seconds. "Hi, Steve," he said eventually."You remember?" asked Steve, and he couldn't quite keep the excitement out of his voice.The Winter Soldier shook his head. "Bits. Very small bits." He hesitated, then added. "That's why I'm here. I want to remember more.""That's great," said Steve. "Bucky, it's so great to have you here."The Winter Soldier shook his head. "I don't know that I'm that guy. It's not- my head's a mess.""Then we'll get it in order," said Steve, with far more confidence than Clint felt was due. Steve stepped forward, holding his hand out. "Come on, come inside."The Winter Soldier hesitated and glanced at Clint, who
