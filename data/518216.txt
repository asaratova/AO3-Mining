Stiles Stilinski, Agent of Shield
It’s his last year of college, four years of learning and studying and there’s a little tiny part of him that is happy that it’s going to be over with.He’s so excited about no more school and no more papers and absolutely positively no more thesis.The only little rain cloud is the whole going home to Beacon Hills (AKA werewolf central) thing. Because he might not be a math genius like Lydia but he knows how to assign some variables and do the math and he puts his life expectancy at about 4 months (give or take three days). He’s out of practice and been stuck in a classroom.There’s been not much time for battling Alpha Werewolf packs, or any of the other little things that he’s sure that the pack has been honing their skills with.He’s done push-ups and sit-ups and he takes a self-defense course and he practices on the range and he does most of that because his dad worries about his safety and he can’t tell him, ‘dad I’m not in Beacon Hills, I’m safe as houses’, without explaining the whole werewolf thing.Which he hasn’t and is not planning on doing unless someone else spills the beans first.He’s not a werewolf, he doesn’t plan on being a werewolf so it’s not his secret to tell.

 He’s in the wrong room, he knows this because there’s a table set up in the front of it and there’s a guy in a suit and three others in really cool black uniforms and he’d get up and leave but the doors have been shut and the guy in the suit is talking.He’d slouch in his seat but everyone else around him is sitting up perfectly straight and he learned in his first year to not draw attention to himself by signaling boredom and a lack of interest of actually being in the room. 

******************************************************************************
 The meeting is for a job with SHIELD and he remembers the news broadcast, remembers sitting on the floor with his back pressed to the sofa watching as aliens invaded New York City and the Avengers kicked their ass.He’s maybe just a little bit of fanboy (they saved the world and two of them are even just human with no superpowers), if he’d been a kid he so would have had the Avengers sheets that hit the market months later and he would have been begging for the supercool action figures that came out in time for Christmas.It’s the only reason that he actually fills out the paper they distribute, it’s not like any application of employment that he’s ever seen before and some of the questions are completely cracked. He wonders briefly if it’s all some sort of joke or if someone is doing some study on peoples willingness to answer stupid questions on a piece of paper handed out by stupidly attractive people in cool uniforms.He dismisses that idea pretty much immediately, the three in uniforms are wandering the room, arms crossed over their chests looking stern and unapproachable, the suit is sitting at the table in the front of the room looking serene, hands folded in front of him.He fills out the application / joke paper to the best of his abilities though it takes some doing. There’s an essay question on favorite color, and personal associations that go along with it.He won’t get selected, his degree is in Folklore with a minor in Psychology (his plan is to treat the pack with love and support and make them a cohesive whole without someone, namely him, getting slammed into walls or beaten up) and from the little speeches they’re looking for like military types with degrees that fit into that spectrum.At least he’ll have a supercool, ‘thanks but we’re not interested’ letter with the SHIELD logo on it for his collection of Avengers (and SHIELD) memorabilia. 

******************************************************************************
 He gets a call for an interview. He doesn’t tell his pack or his dad because he’s almost done with school, he’s not supposed to be extending it by doing an internship and Lydia had told him he was coming home for Christmas, which he’d never agreed to but it’s Lydia so…“Mr. Stilinski,” the suit from the internship meeting is standing there, he shakes his hand and they both sit.They chat about the weather, current economic conditions and Stiles’ Folklore classes.“Folklore and Psychology is an odd mix,” the suit (Agent Twitman, Stiles doesn’t laugh or make a joke, you know, be himself, but only because he’s pretty much chewing through his cheek).“Well my mom did some stuff in Folklore and it’s just interesting and Psychology is because I know a lot of crazy people back home, easy to get work,” Stiles shrugs.Agent Twitman just nods, he’s looking at Stiles like he can see right through him, or read his mind, it’s disconcerting and kind of nerve-wracking.“I think that’s all we need,” Agent Twitman says, he stands so Stiles stands, they shake hands again and the Agent smiles. “We’ll be in contact.”Stiles f
