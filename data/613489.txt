For the longest time, the best kept secret in the Avengers was a simple one, so simple that it often seemed blatantly obvious and yet remained, for a time, almost entirely unnoticed.‘Almost entirely’ being the operative phrase.“Fuel,” Natasha says curtly, sliding a second mug across the conference table.Tony snatches it halfway through its spinning trajectory across the tabletop and drains the contents, all without spilling a drop. “You’re my favourite,” he says, after swallowing.She rolls her eyes.Fury glares at them both, and then starts in on the day’s briefing.“You do realise you’re not Potts’ PA anymore, right?” Clint says to her, afterward.“Yes,” she agrees, expressionless.Clint peers at her for a long second, and then says, “Fine, don’t tell me,” and shoves her shoulder.She shoves back. They grin, and get on with things.***When the team had first moved in, after the Chitauri and after so, so much paperwork, Natasha had cornered Tony in the kitchen in the middle of the night.“I wasn’t wrong,” she said.Tony stared at her, looking like an electrocuted cat, hair in motor oil spikes and gaze more than halfway to manic. “Uh. About what?” he asked.“My report on you,” she said. “The one for SHIELD.”Tony’s face settled into his usual mask, smirk twitching at his lips. “Textbook narcissism,” he said. “Yeah, I got it.”“No,” Natasha said. “That wasn’t true. I was right, but I didn’t write down what I was right about.”Tony raised an eyebrow. “Why?” he asked, more cautious.“You didn’t want their pity,” she said. “So I made sure you didn’t get it.”And with that, she turned and headed back towards the living room.“Why’d you nix me for the team, then?” Tony asked, as she reached the doorway.She looked back at him. “You always fight for the things you’re told to give up on.”He snorted.She slipped out.“You’re still terrifying,” Tony called after her.She bowed her head, hiding her smile even though he couldn’t see her. “Thanks, Stark,” she murmured.***Tony buys her things sometimes, and never in any way that she can prove that it was him. Obscure blends of loose tea, packed in black and gold tins in her bookshelves, orchids on the counter in her bathroom.She never thanks him, because it would be embarrassing for both of them.She does small things as well, which she knows he notices. The coffee, and sometimes smoothing things over with Fury when Tony’s done something particularly heroic and unwise. Fury notices, of course, because when does he not? But he doesn’t understand why, and so he generally accepts that Natasha does things for a reason, and leaves Tony alone.It makes working with Pepper easier, too.“It’s rare, when people notice,” Pepper confides, at one point, over cocktails. “How much he needs looking after, and not just because he a reckless idiot of a genius.”Natasha shrugs. “Don’t let it get around.”Pepper doesn’t.***Natasha has always liked talkers. She knows she isn’t the chattiest person, doesn’t really think to add something to the conversation unless it’s either important or amusing (or both), but she doesn’t hold everyone else to the same standard, and she can appreciate people who fill up the silences that she leaves.If she didn’t, she probably would have killed Clint years ago.“So I’m thinking that maybe we should all go out on the town sometime, as a team,” Tony says, flopping down on the couch next to her. “It’ll be fun, it’ll be, like, a bonding thing that doesn’t revolve around things exploding and getting beat up.”“How do you know a night out won’t end like that?” Natasha replies, blowing over the top of her mug of tea.“Har har, we can totally set ground rules for Thor, right? He’s a prince, he knows how diplomacy works, we can just tell him how best to—““Bruce.”“Bruce will have a great time!”She gives him a look.“Okay, maybe he won’t, but he needs to get used to crowds again, crowds who he has to actually interact with, you know what I mean.”“Yes, I do.” She takes a sip of tea, and sighs. “Invite Coulson. We need backup if things go pear-shaped.”“I enjoy the way you just made a night out into a combat situation. Will Agent Coulson even be willing to join us?”“Clint will provide emotional blackmail.”“You’re actually the best.”“Hey guys, have you seen Thor?” Steve asks, wandering in.“Can’t say that I have,” Tony says.Natasha shakes her head.“Damn. He was supposed to meet me in the gym.”“Hey Cap,” Tony says, “What’s say you and me and the rest of these freaks hit the town this weekend?”Steve gives him a disapproving look. “Do you have to call your teammates ‘freaks’?” he asks.“Have to? No. Enjoy it? Most definitely. Just telling it like it is, Cap. Freaks run the world, we would be one boring race without them.”Steve sighs. “Your tact really leaves something to be desired, Stark.”“Don’t hate the player, hate the game.”“That doesn’t even make sense,” Natasha observes. Tony grins at her, and then back up at Steve.“Didn’t answer my question, by the way. We going out this weekend?”“If you ca
