Steve doesn’t like bullies, on principle. But the truth is, it didn’t start that way—it wasn’t about justice, or decency, or righteous indignation.  It was about the look in the eyes of the people getting stepped on, the people getting trampled, the people getting lost.So it cuts all the deeper, on the rooftop. It sears all the stronger when Steve recognizes strength, precision, endurance, capacity: sees the pieces of himself not born but made, reflected in this body, this person, this weapon when he catches the shield and stares, and Steve knows, somewhere deep, that the killing blow is more than possible, but less than imminent.It slices through Steve’s soul when he returns the gaze, sharp above the colors, the shades of what Steve believes: it burns hot and catches, wildfire and sparking when he reads the only thing that lives, that breathes in the deadness that pervades behind those irises in the night.It’s not You can’t beat me.It’s more You can’t stop them.Those eyes, Steve thinks, don’t add up to choice; don’t shout free will, don’t smack of the agency that’s necessary for real evil, and it haunts the space behind Steve’s eyelids because those eyes, those eyes—Those eyes speak different volumes.______________________________Most people figure it started with a kid at school; started with the sour feeling in his own gut the first time he’d been picked on, been kicked at, been knocked around for no good reason. It’d make sense, really.But that wasn’t where it started.It had taken him weeks to convince his momma to allow him to go: Bucky’d saved the coins and said, we gotta, Stevie, we jus’ gotta go, s’about phantoms, and Bucky was everything—Bucky was an angel sent into Steve’s life to make the world look brighter, to make the air softer when it caught in Steve’s lungs, so he’d begged and he’d begged and his momma’d finally thrown up her hands and told him if he got nightmares, she sure hoped James Buchanan Barnes was the one he’d go crying to in the middle of the night, because she wasn’t going to have nothing to do with it, and Steve had grinned like mad and run out the door and they’d gone to see the flick, and they’d gasped and gawped and it’d been swell as anything, it really had.Except Steve had left the theatre, thinking real long and hard about the villain, the masked man, the one who sparked the screams from other seats: Steve had left the theatre, and thought about the look beneath the scars, and the wideness of the eyes, and the tightness in Steve’s chest that wasn’t caught up in his faulty ticker, but instead, weighed down in the way the world wasn’t fair.Steve threw his first punch, later that week. He went home with a bloody nose—he’d stopped the hurt in the eyes of the boy the other guys had been beating on, and Bucky’s arm was draped close around his shoulders, the warmth of him pressed tight against Steve’s side, and maybe there were ways, Steve thought, things that could be done, that he could do.Maybe there were ways to even the score, sometimes; to make the world a little bit more square.And when they put the couch cushions on the floor, and burrowed under thin blankets in the night: when Bucky’d talk about haunted houses, and Steve’d make up tales about monsters and half-humans, when they’d gasp and giggle about werewolves and vampires, it always ended the same, amidst yawns and heavy eyes.One more scary story, Stevie. And Steve couldn’t deny Bucky a thing, not a single thing, but he was always too darn tired to put much effort in, to make it more interesting than the things that came quickest, held closest to his little, lagging heart: the monsters were never monsters. The beasts were always redeemed. Ghosts are loved, too, he’d said, one night, when Bucky’d snorted at the friendly spectre Steve’d made up to befriend a little girl in the cold.Sap, you are, Bucky’d tsked at him, but his arm’d slung easy around Steve’s waist, and it was warm, and Steve’s chest got tight again—tighter, now, than he thought he could stand.He broke his wrist, that week, because there were things he could do to make the score more even, but there wouldn’t ever be a way to make the heavy need inside his ribs give way.______________________________Once the truth starts to reveal itself, once it starts to become clear how deep the rabbit hole runs, how insidious the threads of betrayal weave through: once Steve realizes what they’re up against, once he starts questioning what it means to be an ally, he can’t stop himself from thinking about what it means to be the enemy: what an enemy reads like in flesh and blood and bone.And he can’t shake the certainty, the shape of it in the cells that make his blood: an enemy makes the call to destroy without wavering. An enemy takes the shot without fear in his eyes. An enemy acts, because an enemy wants to.An enemy acts because an enemy chooses that path. But no creature chooses to be muzzled.You don’t take a free man’s voice away._________________________
