Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It wasn't out of the ordinary for people to come to Sister Margaret's looking for Deadpool. They hear he's the best around, think they can afford him, and come looking for him. Happens all the time, two or three times a week at the very least. Kids came sometimes, desperate little ones who's little money Wade refused.Sometimes people came along asking for a Mr. Wilson. That raised a few eyebrows, and Weasel would discreetly ask questions and coax answers before he would even consider passing Wade a gold card.And then there was this.A pale, skinny boy who couldn't possibly be older than fourteen stormed into the bar, pissed to hell and back. Surprised men let him shove past them. He stomped over to the bar, slamming a hand down on the wood."Tell me where Wade is," the kid demands with a growl, "now.""Who?" Weasel asks, polishing a glass that like it's siblings would never be truly clean."Wade Winston Wilson," he snarled. "Tell me where the fuck he is."Weasel's jaw snapped shut. No one ever knew Wade's full name. Who was this kid? He stayed quiet for another long moment."Well ain't you a pretty little thing," some guy far too drunk to have thought to listen in basically purred at the kid, reaching to tuck a stray curl behind the boy's ear. Weasel was this close to slapping a bitch.His hand snaps out, catching the man's wrist in a crushing grip. Weasel could hear his bones crunching through his screaming. Weasel cringed back, almost dropping the glass in hand. The kid glared at the man, twisting his arm in a way it should not go."Touch me again, and you loose this hand," he says, releasing the offender, who crawls away, rightfully terrified. He looks back at Weasel. "Now, back to business."Wade was healing up in the office after having his arm and part of his skull crushed and his organs spill all over the concrete.Weasel was horrified of this kid. He didn't want to tell him, he really didn't, but Jesus Christ.He managed to keep his mouth shut this time."You don't wanna talk? Fine," the kid said, crossing his arms over his chest. "When he comes crawling out of his hole, tell him his boo's here to see him." Then he turned on his heel, shoved through the crowd, and settled into the corner for the long haul.Okay, what the fuck. Wade was not a father and not a pedophile. What was happening.The kid sat there, growling viciously at anyone who so dared to even think of looking his way for the next three hours.When Wade finally bumbled over to the bar, he gave Weasel an odd look."Who do you look like you just shit your pants?" He questioned suspiciously. "Thought you got used to this ugly mug.""Someone asked me to pass on a message," Weasel said slowly, staring at his hands. Wade made a motion for him to go on. "He said your boo's here to see you."Wade was quiet. Then laughed. "I'm sorry, what? Could you- could you repeat that?""Your boo. Is here. To see you."In all his years of knowing Wade, he had never seen him look so afraid."Oh, no.""Hheeeyyyy Wade!" The kid chirped, making his way back. "We need to talk."Oh, no."Baby boy! Sweetums, honeybunch, babes, Petey-pie," Wade said, taking mesured steps back, "can we not? Shouldn't you be in school?""Nice try, it's two A.M. on a Saturday," Pete, presumably, scoffed. "We need to have a little chat. Red's waiting for us outside."Wade went from afraid to downright petrified in two seconds flat."No we don't! No we don't! You and Red can leave, we do not need to talk, let's just send you on home before your aunt gets worried-"Pete grabbed Wade by his hood and dragged him out of the building, kicking and screaming.Weasel hoped Pete never came back.
