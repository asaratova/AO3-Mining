The blood stops moving out of Volkov's body. For a long time it has moved slowly and more slowly. You don't know how long. How long since Volkov stopped moving? The blood moved for a long time after that. But now: no more. Now: it thickens. You know this about blood, the thickening of it. The way that time turns it to some other substance.
You left your knife in Volkov's belly. The blade secured in slick muscle. You don't need it now. You won't need it again. You sit down on the cement. You pull your knees up to your chest. You wait a long time. The air is cold. The light flickers. You wait. The light flickers. You wait. The light makes a buzz.
Footsteps.
Boot soles on glass and rubble. Fast and light but not silent enough.
Steve steps through the damaged door. Steve moves through the room. He stops when he sees the blood. He makes a sound. The light flickers. The light touches him. You see his face. It is all light and shadow.
You say, He's dead. I made sure he was dead.
Steve says, Oh my God. Bucky. Bucky. Oh my God.
Steve sets his shield down against the chair. Steve moves towards you, very fast. Steve is close to you. Close.
Steve says, Are you... are you okay.
You say, I'm undamaged.
Okay, Steve says. Okay. I didn't know you were... I didn't know if you'd be here. I hoped.
You say, I was here. Before that I was in Lima. Before that I was in Moscow. Before that I was in Washington DC. Before that I. Before that I was.
Steve says, Yeah. I remember.
You say, I needed to end him. Now I'm finished. I knew that you were coming here.
Steve says, Well you definitely...
Steve turns away from Volkov's body. He says, You could have gone. You waited.
You say, I knew that you were coming here.
Steve looks at you for a long time. He says, Well I'm here now. Sam's waiting outside. You wanna... you wanna blow this joint.
You say, I can't light the fuse till we're clear.
(Warehouses have predictable weak points. You laid the C4 quickly. Volkov was no threat but he was not yet bleeding. You did careful work. You checked the fuse.)
Steve says, Uh. Okay.
He waits while you stand up. He straps his shield on. You check the weapons you have remaining. Semi-automatic. Derringer, derringer. A space for the knife you'll never get back. You take off your holster, loaded with guns. You leave it on the floor. Volkov's blood gets on it. Steve stares at you. You say, Okay.
Okay, you say. You move. You start to move through the room. But then you stop because the chair is to your left. You walked past it to enter the room. But. Now you can't walk past the chair. You can't walk past                             You        can't
                                                         You                     can't                          walk                  past                the                   chair.
You clench your hands into fists. Your feet will not lift. Your fingers are cold. Your upper chest hurts. You can't get enough air. You breathe in and breathe in
and in and in and breathe in but you                            breathe                                              in
Steve says, What's wrong are you hurt. Bucky are you hurt.
Steve touches your body. Steve checks you for wounds. Steve touches you on the face with his hands.
I'm undamaged, you say. But. I can't. I can't I can't I can't.
Steve moves you so your face is pressed against his shoulder. His suit smells like car exhaust and sweat. He touches your hair and you don't move. You don't move. He touches your hair over and over again. He says, It's okay. He says, Shh. He says, Come on buddy let's get you out of here.
He keeps your head turned against his chest. He keeps his hand against your head. He moves with you. He leads you through the room. There is blood on his boot-soles. There is blood on your boot-soles. The light flickers. You breathe cold air. In and in and in. He steers you out of the door. For a while it is dark and then it is not dark. The sun blinds you. You can't see where Steve is. But his army is heavy around your shoulder. So you know. You know. You know where he is. 
You sleep for 12.5 hours in a hotel room in Texas. It is dusk when you go to sleep. You smell nitrate on your hands. You are not used to sleeping in beds but you sleep in a bed because Steve says, Why don't you take that bed. Steve says, Why don't you take that bed and Sam and I will trade off. Just to keep watch.
Feel like I'm back in the damn service, Sam says.
You curl up on the bed with your back against the wall.
Bucky do you want to take your boots off, Steve says.
The laces of your boots are knotted together. You pull at one damp mud-caked lace-end. The knot doesn't loosen. You pull harder. The knot doesn't loosen. Your fingertips scrabble over the laces. You make a sound of frustration. The knot doesn't loosen. The knot doesn't loosen.
Steve says, Here let me.
Steve kneels down on the carpet. Steve takes one boot in his hand. For a long time he works on the knot with
