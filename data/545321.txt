Sometimes he remembers, just how young she is. When she's belting out songs he's never heard in the shower, or tugging on panties with Adventure Time characters on 'em, he remembers that she's only a few years older than Jubilee. Granted, these are the trivial details. She's also smart as a whip, attentive, kind, and way too insightful for her twenty-two years. Picturing her with one of the punks her own age who stare too long at her tits at the record store just seems off. Logan knows he's biased, though.
God can she be such a petulant kid sometimes, though.
When the suit comes off and she tosses her badge away, it's cute, the way she puts on that pout and wraps herself around him on her ratty old couch in Queens, telling him about her long, busy day. She's a fuckin' Valkyrie at work, he's seen it. Even if she's the most junior of the three liaisons to the Avengers, herding cats in their labs, she's authoritative and doesn't take anyone's shit, not even Tony Stark's. So Logan kind of loves it, that he's one of the people who gets to see her dissolve back into his gypsy kid who just wants to get naked and eat greasy takeout with him, when he's visiting her in the City.
There are other times, though. Logan knows real well, how much of a picnic he -isn't-, so he doesn't let it rile him as much as another guy might when she goes into one of her moods. When everything gets her ornery, complaining about the most trivial shit, starting an argument just because she can, because she likes the making up. Thing is, he loves her like this, too. When she starts itching for the road and the tossing away of responsibility, that bit of her vagrant mother in her. When all she wants for dinner is beer and wings, when she laughs too loud at the bar, and when she drags him in for a slow, dirty kiss out in public because she likes the way it makes the people stare.
It's immature and volatile and damnit, Logan loves it. Most of the time, anyway. He's always kind of glad, though, when she goes back to the happy kid who tugged him out of his shell, who makes him a better man all the time...but then, Logan figures he could never be with someone who didn't bring out both the best and the worst of him. Maybe that wasn't the most healthy thing, but...aw, hell. Logan's only human. Mostly.

Darcy loves when it's her bi-monthly four-day weekend, because that means she hops on the back of her new-to-her, second-hand motorcycle and speeds up to Westchester. Riding across Canada that spring on the back of Logan's bike had given her a fever, and all of her summer bonus that hadn't gone toward school loans had bought this sexy old gal. She still preferred having her arms around her guy, but they lived apart and a girl needed her own kickass ride. The drive up from the City is more fun this way too, her hair fanning out behind her on the wind, from under the WW2-style bike helmet her buddy Steve Rogers had found for her.
So she arrives as she always does at Xavier's Institute, tousled and flushed, grinning as she tugs off her leather jacket and makes her way through the front room. Logan's got combat training down below with his students for another hour, but Darcy's pretty sure she can entertain herself, "Where my mutant bitches at?" She calls out, and gets a snort in reply from across the room.
"You're early, sugar," Rogue smiles wide, wrapping her up in a hug. Darcy hugs her friend back tightly, grinning.
"Yeah, I though I'd try and get some Marie-time in, before I get carried off by my caveman boyfriend for hot sexin's," She says, making Rogue wrinkle her nose.
"Thanks for that, really. Come'on, there's pizza."
Much as she's anxious to see her fella (between missions on both the Avengers and X-Men fronts, it's been three weeks at this point), Darcy loves seeing Marie, too. Her only real girlfriend in the City is Jane, and as busy as Darcy is, Jane Foster is busier. Or perhaps more insane and obsessive is a more accurate description, but at SHIELD, those are all pretty synonymous. So it's more than nice, reconnecting with her old pal from highschool when she's in Westchester. She knows how hard it can be, for superheros to leave the home base...not that Logan's any example. He stays around when the world is at risk, at least.
"So how's work?" Rogue drawls with a grin, as they sit cross-legged across from each other on the vast kitchen's floor, beers in hand and two open pizza boxes between them. "I saw the last Hyrda attack on tv, didn't look like a summer picnic."
"I was armed and guarding the research, but nope," Darcy chuckles, "Work's all right. It's good, you know? Feeling like you're doing something? It's just..." She sighs, "...My 'doing something' isn't like leaping into the action. I mean, I passed combat training, I can fight off someone...I can, like I said, guard the labs," She smirks, "And I don't envy you or Thor or Logan, being face to face with it daily. I just...uuuuuugh Marie, sit
