Chapter Text

 Hi! Could you do a fic where Sam helps me with wash day? I'm training to be a new Avenger and I'm too tired to tend to my 'fro. I'm natural and have super coily hair that's kinda short and I'm really tenderheaded. I would LOVE to see Sam greasing a scalp, twisting bantu knots, and popping on a satin bonnet after and engaging supportive cuddling! Extra points if you could squeeze in some sexytimes! :) Love your brain so much!!!!
After clearing your schedule, telling everyone you would do it, and stocking up on Shea Moisture products, you were ready. It was happening whether you wanted it to or not. You had on your comfy sweats, you had about three free hours, and your products were ready.Wash day has arrived.But this one was different, because you’d never washed your hair at the Avengers facility before and you were dead tired.Steve had you working hard to get ready to join the team. He was a great coach and was becoming a good friend but everything was aching at the end of each day. You spent Saturday mornings in bed wondering if any of this was really worth it.Getting fit and being an Avenger was all good, but did it have to make you feel like walking death? Even your bones ached, your eyelashes ached. Just the sight of workout equipment had you fatigued. You could barely make it to the kitchen to wash your hair without wanting to collapse on the floor and cry.You held your shampoo, coconut oil, and conditioner under your arm, with your old t-shirt slung around your neck, and mentally gave yourself a pep talk. Your mood lifted when Sam came walking down the hallway, giving you that winning grin. He inspected all of your hair products and paused.“Wash day?” he asked.You sighed. “I thought I told y’all it was wash day.”He shook his head. “I missed that memo.” He noticed the way you were slumping over and immediately became concerned. “You need help with that?”“I’m fine, Sam. Thank you.”“You’re walkin’ like you got weights on your ankles and you’re gonna lean over a sink for thirty minutes?” You leaned on the wall and he took your shampoo and conditioner. “C’mon girl.”“I’d rather you massage my feet or tell Steve to lighten up with the superhero bootcamp.”Sam licked his lips. “Let’s do one thing at a time.” He reached out for your hand and you took it. He helped you off the wall and you made your way to the kitchen together.You and Sam had been close from the beginning. You’d been drawn to his kindness and his sincerity, not to mention the fact that he was fine as hell. But you weren’t sure how he felt about you. Of course, he’d always been protective of you because you were the only Black woman on the team, you hung out all the time, and you’d always had your suspicions that he liked you back, but you never had real proof.But today would change that.
 Sam was an angel, you were convinced. He’d gotten the water to the perfect temperature, used the perfect amount of shampoo, and the way he massaged your scalp was honestly making you want to call your momma and tell her that you’ve met The One.“Feel good?”You hummed and grinned. “Hell yes. The best I’ve felt in weeks.”He laughed. “Good.” Once all the shampoo was rinsed out, he moved onto conditioner. “The bottle says I’m not supposed to rinse it out.”“Yeah, just comb it through while it’s damp.”“Comb or finger comb?”“Finger comb. But, I’m kinda tenderheaded, so be gentle.”“Alright, baby girl.” He sat you upright and soaked up the excess water with your spare t-shirt. He split the hair into little sections, combing through with his fingers and rubbing coconut oil on your scalp. He twisted each section and ravelled it into a Bantu knot. It’d been awhile since you’d felt so pampered and cared for.“Who taught you how to do bantu knots?” you asked him. "You're really gentle for someone with arms the size of my head."“I have women in my family, you know.” he replied. “I love how soft your hair is. How long you been natural?”“About two years, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.”“Your hair is beautiful, and you are too.”You smiled. “You say that to all the girls?”“Nope, just you.”You saw your window to flirt and refused to waste the opportunity. How many times were you going to have Sam Wilson playing in your hair? The very act itself was intimate enough. “Don’t start something you can’t finish, boy.”Sam sucked his teeth. “You’re the one who’s exhausted and you’re talkin’ about me  not starting something I can’t finish?”You couldn’t help but laugh. “Damn… You right.”“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you.”How rude of him to say with only half of your head done…Sam worked through the rest of your hair quickly, trying to be gentle with your kinks and coils.
