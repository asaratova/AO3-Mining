Chapter 1: Team-Up
    




Chapter Text
It was like the battle of New York all over again. Except without the aliens. And without Loki. And without a giant nuke headed to NYC. Oh, and Spider-Man was also there this time. Just as he finished webbing up some of the weird metal freaks attacking the city he heard the sounds of repulsers, very recognizable repulsers, landing next to him.
Oh My God, Iron Man is right beside me, this is the best day of my life
"Thanks kid, wish i could say the same"
crap, did i say that out loud?
"Yep, and you did it again Spidey"Under the mask Peter was freaking out, he was blushing in embarrassment at his first meeting with his favourite avenger.Tony's faceplate came down as he smugly lifted up Spider-Man's arm."Did you make these web gun thingies yourself?" he bluntly asked in fascination.Tony may have been having fun, but Peter was not. He was shy and he always will be, especially when it comes to his work."Yes, Mr Iron Man Stark Sir, i made it in scho-ollege. College. I made it in college" he stumbled a little.Tony hmphed interestingly as he gazed at the strange device which was seemingly stuck on Spidey's wrist."Why don't you drop by Avengers Tower kid, and i'll see if i can fix you up another more super resilient suit, hmmm?"And right before Peter answered, Tony's faceplate went back up and he flew away to the Tower.
Did i seriously just embarrass myself in front of my role model, my idol, my hero? Stupid Peter Benjamin Parker, stupid!

Avengers Tower
Spider-Man hesitated as he landed on the roof on the Tower, wondering if Mr Stark's invitation was more of some sort of superhero formality than an actual invitation.Â 
What if i embarrass myself once again. I'm a 15 year old boy, of course i'll embarrass myself again
However, once again, Peter was scared out of his reverie when, out of nowhere, Tony Stark planted an arm on his shoulder, quickly escorting him into his Tower."So, kid, I'm glad that you took me up in my offer. Avengers Tower is home to you too now that I'm enlisting you"Peter broke out of his dreaming when he realised that this was actually an invitation into the Avengers itself and stated "I'm truly sorry, Mr Stark, but I'm afraid i can't join your super secret boy band, well its not really a boy band because Natasha is definetly a girl, and it's not really secret because the Avengers are very publically known and...""Let me stop you right there Spider-Boy, contrary to popular belief we don't need to know your identity, and the only reason I know that you don't want your identity out is because of your major reluctance to work with a partner on your nightly patrols"Peter paused and thought about the offer, I mean, it would certainly keep his Aunt May safe if he had a team of superheroes to back him up, and he would also get more help than a first aid kit for when he got hurt really badly. It was a good offer."Mr Stark, are you sure that you want me in your team. I'm just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Menace, not one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes"Tony sighed and looked at Spider-Man with a look that could only be exasperation."Spider-Boy, you help people, somehow you have the same moral compass as Steve and the same snarkiness and attitude of me. And as much as i hate to admit it, you're the best of me and Stevo in there"Peter still didn't know what to say so he nodded his head a little and Tony must've took that as a yes, because the next thing Peter knows, he's in the same room as the new Avengers.Peter looked around the room, determined not to let his inner fanboy come out.Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for Tony, Peter made a complete and utter fool of himself."Oh my God, Mr Captain America Sir, you're amazing! Me and my best friend Ned used to play Avengers when we were kids, he was you and I was Iron Man!"As soon as that slips out Steve has an amused expression on his face, Bucky has a mixture of amusement and horrified on his face, while Tony and Clint burst out laughing."Please tell me you're not another Steve" Bucky sighs, meanwhile Tony just says "Yep! He's a mini Steve and a mini Me!! Isn't he awesome!"Peter blushed in embarrassment for the third time that day, but all that blows out of the window the minute that he sees Bruce."You're Bruce Banner..." he whispers in awe.Bruce sadly looks over at Spider-Man and simply says "Yeah, I'm the man who turns into Hulk"Peter gushes at Bruce and runs over to him."Yes, I know that, but.. you're THE Bruce Banner... I've read all if your papers, especially those on the topic of gamma radiation. I even wrote my biology midterm on you're extravagant theories!"Bruce perks up at this, "You, you understood my papers? But you can't be older than 25?""Brucie-Bear, didn't I tell you that Spider-Boy would make an excellent addition to the Science Bros!" Tony boosted triumphantly.A couple of hours later, Tony comes up to Spider-Man and says "Now, Spidey, you have to complete the initiation ritual that we have all d
