Chapter 1: The Sacrifice
    




Chapter Text
“Excuse me, but does your friend often do that?”Tony looked over to where Mantis was pointing and felt his heart drop.  Strange was floating, legs crossed and hands wrapped in green mist and those circular symbols he’d used for fighting.  The odd way he held his hands and how his body was weirdly contorting made Tony’s skin crawl.  He had no idea what was happening, but the twisted look on Strange’s face did nothing to comfort him.  Tony approached him slowly.  He really hated magic.Strange’s head was moving around so rapidly his face was a blur.  Tony had no idea how to interfere or if he should.  The decision was made for him when he finally tore his eyes away from Strange’s face and hands and noticed the Time Stone was glowing bright green.“Strange, we all right?”His steps sped up when Strange suddenly snapped out of whatever trance he’d been in.  Tony caught him quickly as he fell to the ground.“You’re back.  You’re all right.”Strange first looked at him, then straight through him.  He grabbed Tony’s shoulder and gasped for air.  Faintly, he felt Strange’s light squeeze, then he finally looked Tony in the eye.  “Hi,” he said.His eyes were brimmed with tears.“Hey, um, what was that?” Peter asked. “I went forward in time to view alternate futures,” Strange said.  He looked away from Tony and gazed off into the distance.  “To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.”Quill was the first to ask, “How many did you see?”“Fourteen million, six hundred and five,” Strange answered.Strange blinked and the tears had vanished, but the memory of them made Tony dread asking his question.  “How many did we win?”It took a moment for Strange to answer, orange dust blowing past him as he seemed to consider his response.  He bit his lip and closed his eyes, the Cloak curling around him.  Finally, he looked at Tony and said, “One.”And just like that the argument over who had the superior plan bit the dust.“I need to speak with you,” Strange said to Tony.  “Privately.”  Something in Tony’s chest sank.  Straightening his shoulders, he nodded and followed Strange back into the wreck of the donut space ship.  Walking into the cold, dead bridge felt like he was walking to his death.  What had Strange seen and what did he need to tell him?And what exactly had he seen that had changed him so much?  Watching Strange’s trembling hands run through his hair, the way he paced erratically around the bridge was like watching a stranger.  There was no trace of the arrogant asshole wizard that Tony had flown to Titan with.“Strange?”  Tony watched as Strange seemed to be drawing little green symbols in mid-air, shaking his head and then starting again.  Strange closed his eyes and lowered his head, and this definitely wasn’t the same man who had boldly told Tony he was willing to let him and Peter die in order to save the Time Stone.“Strange!” he snapped.  Finally, Strange looked over at him, just for a moment before a quick look of something like guilt crossed his face and he started muttering to himself again.“Okay,” Tony said, keeping his voice carefully even. The suspense wasn’t helping.  “Whatever you saw obviously did a number on you, so I’m gonna break it down.“We know Thanos is coming.  We know he’s already on his way.  Now you tell us there’s only one way for us to win this thing.  I’m guessing it has something to do with me.”  Tony stopped and took a deep breath, then said, with a calm he absolutely did not feel, “And judging from the way you’re looking everywhere but me, I’m guessing it has something to do with me…what?  Dying?”Strange’s head snapped to Tony and his eyes went wide.That gave Tony a wealth of information right there.  He closed his eyes, breathed through his teeth, tried to wrap his mind around something he’d always half expected.Surprisingly, the first thing he felt wasn’t anger or denial.  A shroud of despair fell over him as he felt hope die.  As much as he’d hated to admit it, there had been a little spark of optimism somewhere inside his fragile, broken heart.  That little glimmer of hope that told him there was still time to maybe find someone.  Maybe someone who understood Tony and would let Tony love them.But that sort of ending wasn’t for him.  He didn’t know why he was so shocked.  He’d always had a feeling it would end like this.  Ever since he woke up in that cave in Afghanistan all those years ago.  The hero’s journey ended in sacrifice.  The world would get to go on, would get to be happy.  The hero got to die happy, knowing they made it happen.  God, he hadn’t wanted that to be him.  His life wasn’t finished yet.  There was still so much for him to do.  Maybe it hadn’t worked with Pepper, but they were still great friends.  He hadn’t thought he was capable of that, but hey, it looked like he could surprise even himself.  And Rhodey.  He didn’t want to leave his oldest friend.  Plus, he’d come to love Peter so much.  Maybe he was a terrible fa
