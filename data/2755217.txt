Chapter Text
“Buck, no,” Steve breathes it, gasps it, eyes wide as saucers. “No.”That broad is chest heaving, and it’s the size of it that keeps Bucky from slipping back, from watching traitor-lungs trying to rob him of everything he holds close, everything he needs where it lives inside that skinny body, that too-strong-to-be-so-goddamned-weak heart beneath him.But it’s a broad chest, here. They’re okay.It’d be a lie to pretend that he remembers everything. Even if Hydra had never happened, even if he’d reached the ripe ol’ age of 30 by the late 1940s like he ought to have, he wouldn’t have remembered everything. So while the serum he’s got does most of the heavy lifting in the memory department, in the now, Bucky’s not bothered anymore. He never would have remembered everything, and besides: he remembers what counts.And what fucking counts, right now, is that Bucky knows he’s jerked Steve off about a million goddamn times, and never once has Steve asked him to hold off, and maybe he doesn’t remember everything.But this—Steve’s dick, thicker than it was when they started, when they first made that leap, but with the same perfect curve it’s always had, with the same twitch-response to the pad of Bucky’s thumb at the tip as it ever made, as it ever had: this, Bucky’s pretty damn sure he remembers just fine.Maybe it shows in his eyes, or maybe it’s just that Steve knows him, that Steve can read all the things that don’t have tells—maybe. But Steve’s still gasping, still wide-eyed and swallowing hard, Bucky’s hand loose around the heavy length of Steve’s shaft, still: maybe Steve sees it, maybe Steve hears it or feels it, when Bucky’s heart trips, stumbles on down to his stomach, to the soles of his feet.“No,” Steve’s jaw goes slack, his eyes flash and Bucky would laugh, probably, at the desperate look on that face if he weren't so damned confused. But then Steve leans up, reaches for Bucky’s chin and fuck all, but Bucky leans into it and lets that touch suffuse his whole body, lets it coax his heart back up where it belongs to beat that cage of his ribs like a madman, like a beast: like it’s Steve’s—’cause it is—and it wants out to hold to him, to cling to him, to stay. “I don’t,” Steve stammers, fingers stroking the lines of Bucky’s cheekbones on either side, and Bucky’s holding his breath and can’t seem to quit, not until Steve tips his head and kisses Bucky full on, forces him to gasp if he wants to stay conscious, if he wants to keep this, here and now.“I don’t mean no,” Steve rushes to explain. “Jesus, yes, all of the fucking yes, Buck.”And he jumbles the words between both their lips a little, but the need to say them seems at odds with a need to taste Bucky, to drink him in, and Bucky’s blood sears with that in a way that promises he’ll never have to know the cold again, so it’s okay. It’s okay.He stretches fingers down to tease Steve’s sac, just the ghost of a touch, and Steve shivers, mouth open, eyes fluttering closed, and yeah; yeah.That.“Don’t fucking stop, never fucking stop,” Steve murmurs, mouth gaping as he cants his hips into Bucky’s touch, but it’s controlled in a way Bucky wants to get rid of; it’s holding back, and Bucky doesn’t have a goddamned clue as to why. “Just,” and Steve’s hand shoots out to grab Bucky’s wrist, to still the hand Bucky’s got poised to roll Steve’s ball against the palm, and Bucky’s gaze flickers up to meet that infinite blue, and it’s waiting for him, and Bucky can’t help but do what he always does: fall fully, and get real fucking lost in it.“Don’t stop,” Steve breathes, and there’s a world in those eyes, and Bucky’s convinced that’s the world that brought him back from the dark, that’s the place that Bucky pulled himself from hell to see again; but those eyes have got an edge to them, too, just now, and Bucky’s gaze narrows, sharpens to find what it means, to read it true: apprehension, and it’d be heartbreaking if Steve wasn’t slowly dragging Bucky’s left hand from in between his thighs to rest at the center of Steve’s chest instead; if Steve wasn’t taking the touch he’d pressed to Bucky’s cheek and trailing it over the scars at his shoulder, mapping that terrain with a tenderness that makes Bucky feel faint, every time.It’d be heartbreaking, or just about, if Steve so much as blinked, if Steve wasn’t staring at him wholly and offering his soul behind those fucking endless eyes.“Don’t stop,” Steve rasps again. “Just,” and Bucky feels the pressure of his touch as it moves down, as fingers fold between metal and grasp, and clutch, and hold.“Other hand,” Steve breathes out, weighed down with significance, with wanting, and the apprehension, the hesitation—Bucky sees it now, where it meets the edge of lust, where it bobs in Steve’s throat with a thick, heady need; pounds under Bucky’s right hand like armageddon and the tides.Oh.“Use your other hand,” Steve commands it, beg
