Hello! Originally I wasn’t gonna try and write cause I’m pretty sure it will be super cringe, I’ve never tried writing conversations,
and I’d be terrified if my family found out I wrote fanfiction. BUT I am gonna try anyway cause I’m bored lol.So, please give me one shot prompts in the comments cause I have no idea what to do.Here are characters I will write about/characters I want to be the main character of said fic and fandoms I’ll write about :)My hero academia/Baku squad (I’ve never actually gotten past the first two episodes….. I just love the fanfics please don’t come after me Ik that’s bad).The Mcu universe, Peter Parker, and Natasha Romanov. Basically all the avengers ig but mainly those two, (I love found family btw)The Dsmp, Tommyinnit/Bench trio, and SBI. (I will probably sensor out swearing because I dislike it, well correction I don’t like swearing, I don’t really care if I hear it, so if that bothers you don’t suggest any dsmp stuff)And that’s all I can write about lol.I’d probably be best writing mcu stuff…. But eh- Please suggest stuff I have no ideas :DStuff I won’t do:Smut/Lemmon Probably no ships, I would suck at writing that and I don’t particularly want to. I might but it will most likely just be something in the background or it will just be there and I won’t touch on it.I will do angst, but nothing like suicide/self harm. Thank you! -A random starting out writer
