Chapter 1: Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated (Confucius)
    




Chapter Text
  It was raining cats and dogs when Tony and Tony met for the very first time at the very first boarding school they were sent to, both of them more than aware that it was a means of their parents to outsource them and their education to a third party. Though, most probably, it was less to make sure they learned their manners and their Shakespeare, but to get them out of their parents’ hair.Anthony DiNozzo Senior had been thrilled to bits that his son had befriended the Stark heir, weaseling his way into the good graces of the weapons manufacturer immediately. Howard Stark liked Senior’s contacts all over the world more than the man, not caring that some of them were dubious at best. He needed money, a very well-kept secret by the Stark Industries board members – but the search for his super soldier was expensive, and he for sure would not give it up.Tony and Tony had a rather matter-of-fact view on their parents already at the very ripe age of 5. Howard Stark was a raging functional alcoholic already before he met Maria, but Isabella DiNozzo, née Paddington, gave him a run for his money even on a good day. Maria Stark was a society trophy wife trapped in a loveless marriage her parents had forced her into after she found out she was pregnant, and Anthony DiNozzo Senior had only had one good reason to marry his wife, pregnant or not: her family’s money.Both children had been shy, not used to being around other kids, the Stark heir too intelligent for his own good and neglected, and the DiNozzo scion smart, but weary and distrustful of any other person thanks to various broken promises by his parents and his Dad’s con-man attire.They bonded over robot pets that Tony Stark built to substitute a furry version none of them ever was allowed to have, and hilarious stories and movies Tony DiNozzo told and made his friend watch, respectively, and the weirdness of eidetic memory. They decided early on that they might be better off where they were instead of having to suffer the craziness of their parents at home.By the age of 8, Tony DiNozzo had lost his alcoholic mother and the one trust fund Senior knew of to his rapscallion of a father. The Paddington side of his family started making preparations that this would not happen again, practically disowning the boy so his Dad could not get his greedy little fingers on their money. Tony Stark didn’t care for any of that as he comforted his friend, and organized for Jarvis to take them to the funeral, as DiNozzo Senior conveniently had “forgotten” to fetch his son.By the age of 11, Tony Stark had skipped so many grades that he was starting High School, meaning that they would get separated rather sooner, than later. Anyway, Anthony DiNozzo Senior had fucked up really big this time, his former friend Howard ending up suing him for everything but his underpants for embezzlement, leaving him no other option than asking his late wife’s family for money to care for his son while wooing replacement-Mommy number three at the same time for some start-up resources.The Paddingtons, surprisingly, paid for the Military School his father opted to send him to, and also did not ask about the additional fees Senior claimed, most probably knowing that the money never made it to his son.Tony DiNozzo finished school on top of his class more or less at the same time that Tony Stark graduated from the MIT with God knows how many Master degrees and a PhD in engineering. He also was the one person holding a shell shocked Tony Stark during the funeral of both of his parents while dealing with the fact that his own father had disowned and more or less dropped him like a hot potato after finding out that he would be pursuing a sports career at the Ohio State University.By the age of 21, Tony Stark had stepped up as CEO and powered through the task of leading the almost bankrupt company his father had left him back to the top of the Fortune Fifty. At the same time, Tony DiNozzo powered through one of the darkest hours in his life so far – his knee was broken, and his dreams of a career in either basketball or football were shattered.It was not the first time that either Tony cried in the arms of the other. Though, it was the first time they kissed, confused at first of what this might imply, both of them struggling with their sexuality for a minute or two, before deciding that they would continue comforting the other by any means available – it proofed to be rather satisfying in the end, so why change it?Tony Stark helped Tony DiNozzo figure out his plan for his further life, and after it was clear that his knee would heal and be as good as new, just not good enough for a sports career anymore, it was an easy decision to apply for the police academy and take up some criminology and psychology courses while his leg was healing.Tony Stark learned a lot more about criminology and psychology in t
