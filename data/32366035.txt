Chapter 1





Chapter Text

You covered your mouth to keep your moans from spilling out as Wanda trailed kisses down your neck, her hands slowly making their way under your shirt. She pinched your side playfully, you could feel her smile on your neck. 
 
"Let me hear those pretty sounds." 
 
"The t-team." You stumbled over your words as she sucked harshly on your pulse point. You felt one of her hands drift down to the front of your sweatpants, teasingly pulling at the strings. "They'll hear us.." 
 
"They're busy with the movie." 



"Since when does 'go get popcorn ' translate to 'fuck on the counter' ?" Natasha asked, no actual annoyance in her voice. You squeaked and turned invisible leaving Wanda to explain your position on her own. "She leave?" 
 
"No she's still on the counter, um popcorn still...popping?" Natasha snorted at Wanda's lame excuse. 
 
"What's taking so long??" Tony yelled from the main room. 
 
"They're fu-" you had moved from the counter and slapped your hand over her mouth, still invisible. 
 
"We're coming!" You yelled, you made yourself visible again sending Natasha a warning glare. "If you tell anyone I will post the video of you singing karaoke at Clint's." She narrowed her eyes at you. "Licking me isn't going to help you Natasha." She gripped your wrist and moved your hand with ease.
 
"Fine, but can you refrain from fucking in public?" 
 
"We'll try, but I think we'll be skipping movie night tonight. '' Wanda grinned and grabbed your hand practically dragging you to your room."
