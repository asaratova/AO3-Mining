Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Rhodey gave Clint a lift down from his perch once the last giant sewer rat had been killed."Well, that was pretty fucking disturbing," said Clint to the others as they gathered around the corpse to catch their breaths. Bucky looked fine, other than a bit of dirt scuffed along his metal arm. He gave Clint a questioning lift of his eyebrow that Clint returned with a quick nod. Clint wanted go over to him, just to touch him and make sure he was still okay, but he kept his distance. There were three media helicopters circling overhead and at least four more reporters filming from just behind the police barricade at the end of the street so they were all having to be very PR-conscious, which meant not making out with his secret soulmate just yet."I'm pretty sure these bastards are going to feature in my next nightmare," agreed Natasha."Rats the size of ponies," said Wanda, shaking her head. "They were terrifying enough on their own, did they really need the glowing red eyes as well?"Rhodey winced. "Don't.""I'm guessing we're not mentioning the smell," said Steve."Not if you value your life," said Natasha.Wanda gave a shudder. “I'm going to be scrubbing myself down with disinfectant when we get back.”Clint grinned. "Suddenly, I'm really glad to have been five storeys up for the whole thing.""I'm even more glad to be in a hermetically sealed environment," said Rhodey. Clint noticed that he hadn't opened his faceplate like he usually would once a fight was over."I've smelt worse," said Bucky, giving one of his little shrugs that meant you'll never understand the horrors I've seen.Natasha raised an eyebrow. "If you're talking about Clint's socks, then I wholeheartedly agree.""Hey!" protested Clint. "My socks are perfumed delight."Bucky snorted. "I don't know which perfume you're thinking of, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't sell very well."Steve glanced over his shoulder at the barricade, where more press were gathering now that the danger had passed. "I'm gonna have to talk to the cameras. Who's coming with me?"There was a universal silence. Clint did his best to inch behind Rhodey without drawing attention to himself in any way.Steve rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on. This is an easy one: obvious bad guys, no civilian injuries, not even that much collateral damage. We've just got to smile and give a couple of soundbites."Bucky snorted. "When did you become the PR guru?" Oh man, rookie error. Clint really should have warned him not to draw attention to himself when Cap was looking for a victim to throw to the media vultures.Steve gave him a cheerful smile. "Well volunteered, Bucky. You're coming with me."Bucky gave him a horrified look. "What? Oh, no. No, come on, no one wants to see me on their TV screen. I thought you were looking for good PR?""It's time you started doing more than glaring at the press," said Steve. "You're never going to change your profile if you never interact, you know?""No, I don't know," said Bucky. "What the hell language are you talking?"Steve put an arm around his shoulder and started to pull him in the direction of the cameras. "Don't worry, you won't even have to smile. Just try not to look like you're going to kill anyone, answer a couple of questions without swearing or threatening to break bones, and don't mention Clint."Bucky glanced over his shoulder at Clint with a terrified look. Clint gave him the smuggest grin he could manage and a thumbs up."Okay, this is going to be comedy gold," he said once Bucky and Steve were out of earshot. "Viewing party once we're back at the base, right?"Natasha nodded. "Shots every time it looks like someone is about to be eviscerated.""I think someone will definitely die if Bucky finds out you're doing a drinking game based on him," said Rhodey."Nah, it'll be fine," said Clint. "He loves me, remember?""He doesn't love Natasha," Wanda pointed out.Clint shrugged. "Yeah, okay, but do I really need her now I've got a new favourite assassin?"Natasha gave him a cold smile. "I know where a lot of your bodies are buried, Barton," she reminded him.Clint made a face but nodded agreement, glancing over at where he could see Bucky hovering behind Steve as the reporters threw questions at them. He slid his finger down inside his bracer to touch his print. Bucky was flooded with nervousness but there was a layer of forced composure over the top that meant he was holding it together.Rhodey dug a hard, metal elbow into Clint's side. "Watch it," he said. "That's not as subtle as you seem to think, and there are cameras everywhere right now.""I might have an itch," said Clint, pulling his finger out.Rhodey snorted. "Oh yeah, you've got an itch all right.""You know, just because you're Iron Man 2.0 doesn't mean you have to torture us with Tony's brand of bad jokes," said Clint.Rhodey raised an eyebrow. "Okay, just for that, I'm not stopping Steve from giving you the talk about respect for your team members when he finds out about your little drin
