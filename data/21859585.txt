Chapter Text
______________________________________The Avengers were called in around 10 pm, due to a robot invasion that is trying to take over the city of New York... again. Dr.Banner was in the Quinjet just in case if anyone gets hurt, due to them not needing Hulk.“Why does everything happen in New York? Like can they not go after other places?" whined Tony in the commas. He was in the air, flying; so he can take out the robot that are climbing up the buildings.“I don’t know, but we have a job to do and later we can watch a movie and eat some pizza” whiz Steve since one of the robots jump on top of him before he knocks it with his shield. He looks around. Natasha and Clint were doing fine; destroying the robot who we unsuccessfully to get near them. Scott and Rhodey were helping out Tony. Bucky, Sam, and Loki with blasting the robots with bullets and magic. Thor was smashing them with his mighty hammer.Steve looks around and saw another group. “Shit”, he cursed.“Hey, can anyone take down the group of robots that are coming on my left? ask Steve who was busy with 4 robots that just appeared.“Sorry Roger. A little busy here!”, told Tony.“Yeah I’m can’t !“, yelled Natasha.While Steve was busy with the 4 robots, he heard a swoosh sound on his left. Next thing you know, one of the robots fell, destroyed. Then a person in a red and blue suit appeared.Spider-Man came out to help the Avengers, which was a good thing because the thing is about to heat up.” Need some help?” asked Peter, webbing up robots and smashing them against each other.“Yeah, mind helping out!” yelled Sam who was busy trying to get one of the robots off of his wings.” Can do!” replied Peter getting straight to the job.------In just under an hour, all the robots in the city were destroyed. Now they were finishing up cleaning the miss. Nat and Clint were busy sending a report to SHIELD. Steve, Bucky, and Thor were throwing the destroyed robots in a trash pile.” Great job everyone! Movie night at the Avengers Tower!” told Tony to everyone. Everyone let out of ’yea hoo’ but Tony didn't pay attention to that because he notices that Spider-Man was about to leave.” Hey! Where are you going? Aren’t you coming over?” asked Tony to Spider-Man” Will I’m not exactly an Avenger so...” trailed off Peter.” Kid, you help us out today, and besides we kind of want to get to know you a bit better more since after- How long has it been? Four years since we first meet you, and we don’t know anything about you. So do you want to come over so we get to know you more and you can get to know us as well?” said Tony.” And besides. You always help us out more times than we can count.” pop in Sam.”I'm with birdbrain,” said Bucky which Sam let out a screech and a smirk from Scott.Peter was shocked. It was a dream to meet the Avengers for so long when he was a kid. But ever since the powers he gained from the bite, he wants to help others. He became a hero for the city that he lived in and loved. After months of being Spider-Man, SHIELD and the Avengers wanted to know who he is and what are his motives. He told everything except his identity. At first, he thought they were going to force him to reveal himself and make him stop since he was 14 years old at the time. But no, they didn’t. They allowed him to have some privacy. Which he was very thankful for.He smiled under the mask. “Yeah I’ll be there just need to clean myself up first” finally said, Peter“We got extra clothes and a shower. Just come with us” said Tony“Ok” and with that Peter followed the Avengers to the tower to get to know each other.
