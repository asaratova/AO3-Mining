Chapter 1: Pull over, let me drive for a while
    




Chapter Text
They've been driving through the American Midwest for several hours already when night finally falls.“You okay?” Bruce asks waking up from his nap.“I don't know who's bright idea it was for my family to move out here after I went MIA. My mother loved the city,” Bucky says.“They probably couldn't afford to live there anymore. It's fine. Whenever you want to visit one of us will ride up with you. If you take Stephen next time you won't need to drive,” Bruce says pulling out the cup of coffee they had picked up after visiting the graves.“I guess,” Bucky says.“How are holding up?” Bruce asks.“It sucks. My parents died not knowing if I was alive or dead,” Bucky says hands squeezing the steering wheel tightly.“It's not fair I know. I can't even begin to understand what all this must feel like for you. Do you talk to Steve about this?” Bruce asks.“He doesn't understand. He keeps clinging to me. To the Bucky he knew. But I'm not that Bucky anymore. I'm different now. He doesn't understand why I want to forget the past and I'll never get why he wants to ignore the present,” Bucky says.“You should never try to forget the past. You should simply try to move on from it. You and Steve are different people you have different needs and feelings,” Bruce says.“I know. But I don't want to say anything to him about it because I'm the only thing he has left. I don't know what he would do if he felt like he was losing me and I don't know if I could stand doing that to him,” Bucky says his hands shaking.“Pull over. Let me drive for awhile,” Bruce says and Bucky pulls the car over and they switch.“Steve had every chance to cement his place in this decade. He had the option to make friends to put down roots, to learn and grow. He refused. You can't keep doing this to yourself for his sake. You have friends besides him who need you in this decade,” Bruce says.“Thank you Bruce. I will keep that in mind,” Bucky says as the soft hum of the engine lulls him to sleep.
