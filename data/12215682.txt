Chapter 1





Chapter Text

It had been an accident, finding Bucky. 
 
Sure, Steve had been searching for Bucky for 

years

, every chance he had, because he knew in his 

soul

 that Bucky hadn't died after that fall from the train. Not Bucky. Not his best friend. And then to realize that the 

Winter Soldier

, the assassin that the Avengers had been hunting for months-- 

god

, that moment on the freeway when the Soldiers mask had flown off and Steve had found himself staring into Bucky's eyes--
 
Steve thought he could have screamed, right then, staring at his oldest friend, who was staring right back with not a single ounce of recognition in his gaze. Steve could have 

screamed

. 
 
But instead he chased him, and when he lost him there, Steve looked for him everywhere else, country to country, city to city until he finally pinned him down in Hungary-- a botched assassination attempt of the Prime Minister that drew the attention of half the world’s leaders and of course, the attention of the Avengers. 
 
The team had blown into Hungary with a vengeance, ruthlessly tracking down every person involved in the plot, ripping through the terrorist cell responsible, and spending every spare second to look for the Winter Soldier. Every piece of their intel pointed to the Winter Soldier having left the area, fleeing back to wherever he called base, but Steve-- Steve had just 

felt 

that Bucky hadn't gone anywhere. 
 
So instead of leaving with the rest of the team, Steve had done one last check on the last known hiding place of the Soldier, a shitty motel with leaking roofs and moldy carpet--
 
--and walked in on Bucky having a complete breakdown in the corner next to a messy bed. 
 
Something had broken through-- something had triggered Bucky and his Winter Soldier conditioning had slipped, and left Bucky a confused, terrified mess, alone in a city he didn't remember traveling to, facing down a man who he thought had died decades ago. 
 
Bucky hadn't even been able to stand up, to far into a panic attack to do much more than crouch there shaking, unable to decide if he wanted to hide or to fight. His left arm--that fucking metal 

monstrosity 

that had replaced his left arm-- was held out defensively, but his black wings were wrapped around his protectively, the stomach turning scent of a 

panicking

 Omega nearly choking Steve. 
 
And then the Soldier had looked up, and the arm had dropped, the wings relaxed and he had blurted “Stevie?” and Steve had nearly collapsed with relief, tossing his shield in the corner and wrapping both his arms and wings around Bucky. 
 
It might have been an accident, but in the end, Steve had 

found 

him.
 
And it had been weeks now, pushing nine weeks since then, and Bucky still wasn't… he still wasn't Bucky. 
 
Steve had called home, asked Tony to make arrangements, and they were put up in a world class rehab center in Germany, one that specialized is PTSD and POW survivors, trying to give Bucky every chance they could to get better. 
 
Some mornings the doctors made progress, the therapists somehow said the right thing and Bucky would look up, his eyes wide, and he’d call for Steve in a worried tone of voice, his wings shaking uncertainly, 

hope

 threading his words, the barest hint of that Brooklyn accent coming through.
 
Other mornings he would sit on the couch with his head hanging, long hair covering his face, left hand gripping the cushions so tight they were shredding beneath his fingers, wings high and flared so no one would come close, nothing but 

aggression, anger, defiance

 souring his scent, his voice the flat empty tony of the Soldier.
 
Every day was a battle, and uphill one at that, but Steve wasn't going to give up. 
 
He 

wasn't

. 
 
He hadn't been able to save Bucky back when he fell, he wasn't about to lose him this time.

Then one day, just one random day, a Wednesday maybe, nothing special about it at all, Steve woke up to find Bucky sitting at the edge of his bed, wings drooping, holding his left wrist in his right hand, watching the plates move as he clenched and unclenched his hand. 
 
“Hey.” Steve said cautiously, moving slowly so he didn't startle Bucky, but trying to sit up so he could at least be on guard if it was the Soldier sitting on his bed and not his friend. “Is everything alright?” 
 
“They really messed me up, didn't they, Stevie? Good thing I ain’t left handed, huh?” Bucky asked softly. “I mean, I bet this thing has it's benefits and all, but nobody wants lovin’ from a fella with cold hands.”
 
Steve ran a hand over his face. “Shit, Bucky. It's actually 

you

. Jesus, I'm so glad--”
 
“You see what they did to my feathers?” Bucky raised the heavy wings, his voice unsteady. “I always thought they were pretty just black, you know? Prettiest wings on the block, I had. But now look--” he raised them higher, and the tips of his primaries slid across the concrete floor with a fain
