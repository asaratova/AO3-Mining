Chapter 1: Established Contact
    




Chapter Text
Peni: Hi everyone! Or maybe just hi me, if the communications are unable to cross dimensions. Or if Gwen wasn’t able to deliver all of the laptops.Gwen: Excuse me.Gwen: Where’s the faith? I did manage to figure out how to open mini-portals before you did.Peni: Gwen! Yay! It works!Gwen: Did you really doubt yourself?Peni: Not really. But there’s a chance for errors. Creating a laptop that can connect to six dimensions at once is tricky business.Gwen: Hey, you nailed it on the first try. Do you know how many dimensions I was forced to peek into before I found the right ones?Peter B: Don’t you kids have school?Peni: Sure! I built the first prototype during study hall.Gwen: Eh. School can’t teach me how to program a generator to create a small portal that leads to very specific dimensions.Peter B: I’d like to point out that we went through a heck of a lot of trouble to stop Kingpin’s collider from destroying the space-time continuum.Gwen: That’s exactly why I don’t do it often and only keep it open for a short amount of time.Miles: I was mostly focussed on keeping Brooklyn from disappearing down a black hole. And making sure you guys got home safely.Peter B: That should not have been an afterthought.Miles: It wasn’t an afterthought. It just came after my first thought.Porker: Looks like the gang’s almost back together. We’re just missing a monochromic presence.Peni: Noir! Didn’t Gwen tell you what time we’d be meeting?Porker: Maybe there’s a time difference.Miles: I don’t think it works like that.Gwen: The guy is living in 1933. You really don’t expect him to master the laptop this quickly, do you?Peni: I gave him a tutorial.Gwen: Did he understand anything you were telling him?Peni: He was listening very intently. He didn’t say a word until I was finished.Gwen: I left him with you for two hours. He didn’t say anything?Miles: That’s not exactly unusual for Noir.Gwen: Peni, I’m sure you did a fine job, but it was also your first time teaching an old person how to use a computer. Trust me, sometimes it takes a while.Peter B: That’s offensive.Gwen: What?Porker: He doesn’t appreciate being called old. He tries to forget about it.Peter B: Shut up.Gwen: I didn’t technically call you old.Peter B: I’m pretty sure Noir is around the same age as me. So you’re calling me old by association.Noir: I AM NOT OLDPeni: He’s here!Miles: Hey man! Glad you could make it.Gwen: Hey, Noir!Porker: The Old Man Club is complete!Peter B: We are not old!Peter B: Tell them, Noir.Noir: WE RE STILL A COUPLA SPRY JOESMiles: Oh no.Miles: His caps lock. He’s engaged the caps lock.Gwen: There’s no hope.Peni: Yes there is! There’s always hope!Noir: WHATS A CAPS LOCKNoir: IS THAT SLANG FOR SOME KIND OF HATMiles: Someone send help. Go to him, Peni!Peter B: Ya’ll are being overdramatic.Gwen: We’re really not.Porker: The caps lock is a button, Noir. Do you see the light blinking on your keyboard?Noir: THERE ARE SEVERAL LIGHTS BLINKING AT MEPorker: You want the one on the very left side of the keyboard. You know, on the key that says caps lock?Noir: OHNoir: whats it doNoir: oh makes the letters smallerPeter B: You know what I change my mind. There’s every reason to be overdramatic. This is kind of painful.Peni: It’s not his fault!Gwen: She’s right. We’ll just have to be patient.Noir: patient with whatPorker: So who’s going to teach him about the punctuation keys?Miles: I’d love to, but I actually have an essay to write. Catch you guys later!

Peter B: Teenagers. Just the worst.Porker: That was pathetic. I can’t believe you fell for that.Noir: i dont get itPeter B: Don’t worry about it. It was a joke that wasn’t funny.Peni: I’ll write up a manual for you, Noir. It’ll tell you everything you need to know about your new laptop.Noir: that would be nicePeter B: When you’re finished with it Peni, how about I revise it for you?Peni: That would be great! You could add anything I might’ve missed.Porker: And he can translate it into Old Person so Noir can understand it better.Peter B: I’m starting to think this multidimensional chat room isn’t the best idea.
