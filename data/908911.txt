Chapter 1: Pro: Annoy Tony with iPod
    




Chapter Text

Despite working with SHIELD and being in highly Avenger-centric situations, it was surprisingly easy to keep secrets. True, Hawkeye was more often than not spying from the ventilation systems, and Natasha's eyes saw everything --she even noticed when Jane wore a shade of lipstick half a shade darker than her usual color one day. After almost six months of being surrounded by spies and superheroes, though, Darcy Lewis was pretty confident that she had achieved the impossible.It helped, she conceded, that she did not live in Stark Tower with the rest of the Avengers. Though Tony had offered a room when he finally noticed her presence in Jane's lab two weeks after her arrival --and she tried very hard not to hold that against him-- she had politely and graciously declined. It wasn't that she didn't appreciate the gesture, and lord knew that even with SHIELD paychecks coming on a regular basis she was still on a tight budget and could have used the free rent. But she had worked hard to find the one-bedroom apartment, scouring newspapers and online notices for weeks before she moved to the city, and she had already signed a lease, and just in case the Avengers got sick of her or she mortally offended Tony --though the longer she knew him, the less possible she thought that was-- she didn't want a broken lease hanging over her head and possibly harming any chances she had of getting another place on her own.
Her six-month lease was nearly up now, and Darcy sat at the small dinette table in the small kitchen of her small apartment making a list of pros and cons on whether or not to extend her lease or whether she should move into Stark Tower with the rest of the disgustingly talented and beautiful after all. She told herself she wasn't bitter about being the odd man out; she may not have superpowers or be dating the god of thunder, but she was a goddess in her own right, and she could name on both hands the number of people who would fall into decline if she were to disappear. And there were perks, aside from the nonexistent rent, to living there."Think of the sound systems at your disposal, D," Tony had told her just the other day. "And all the Starktech at your disposal so you don't need to worry about that worthless POS you bring in every day."
Darcy smiled at the memory and wrote Annoy Tony with iPod in the pros column. If there was one point of contention between the two of them, it was that she had failed to upgrade from Apple to Starktech. It wasn't that she didn't like the idea of a newer, less-likely-to-break-when-I-really-need-to-jam mp3 player, and she knew if she asked for one in a bright purple zebra pattern, she would get it (not that she would, of course, but it was nice knowing she could if she so desired). The look on Tony's face, however, when he had first seen the so-called archaic device in her hands had been priceless, to say the least, and Darcy now wouldn't change her iPod for anything.A ding sounded from behind her and she went still a moment before a large smile broke out on her face and she vacated the kitchen for the equally small living room. The Starktech laptop --she couldn't say no to that one after celebrating her previous laptop's eighth birthday last year-- was situated precariously on the arm of the old sofa and it wobbled a little as she sat down. Jane had nearly had a heart attack when she had first visited and nearly fally through the old thing. (Darcy had since had the base of the sofa reinforced.) The piece was falling apart, the covers were ripped, if you didn't fall through you would sink in the obnoxiously squishy cushions anyway, and who in their right mind wanted a bright green sofa with apples all over it? Darcy did, for one, and she was prepared to fight to the death if Tony said she couldn't bring the old thing into her new state-of-the-art apartment. Sure, the piece of furniture was mere steps from a bonfire, but it had character and Darcy thought it suited her perfectly.It wasn't the sofa, however, that was making her smile as she settled in front of the laptop and opened up the Skype application. How anyone had survived before video chat, she didn't know, and her smile widened as she noted the green icon beside the screenname ShakespearesDelia26. She clicked on it immediately and chose video call and waited while it rang."Okaa-san!"Darcy laughed as the bright-eyed young girl spoke before she could, and she let her eyes soak up every pixelated feature before she replied."What is that? Korean?"Turquoise eyes rolled in exasperation and her lips formed a pout. Darcy figured she should probably keep to herself how adorable that expression was, and she bit back a smile. Cordelia Kathryn Lewis was the absolute apple of her eye, and more like her than she possibly cared to admit, and despite the age difference, Darcy admitted to a little fear concerning her temper."It's Japanese," she answered mulishly and Darcy n
