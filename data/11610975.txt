Avengers Compound, New York
A hush fell over the dinner table."I'm sorry, you want to what?" Rhodey asked the question on everyone's mind. "I think that I should go to court," Pietro repeated, "to answer for what I did during...during Ultron's attack."Rhodey frowned. Pietro's green card had just come through by the skin of Tony's teeth and the Sovokian knew that. Going to court would risk everything. Laura cleared her throat. "Kate, could you take the children to the movie room please?" She asked her niece, "We'll be along as soon as possible." Fortunately the children knew not to argue and they quickly slid out of their chairs. Peyton looked far too happy about the fact she didn't have to eat her broccoli. Rhodey looked over at Tony. The Stark patriarch looked concerned, but not overly worried. "Why go to court?" He asked, "Why not just go to the newspapers or post a video.""Because it will show the world that I care about justice and the law and that I'm not...I'm not..." The speedster struggled to finish the sentence, clenching his fists around his cutlery. "Piet..." Honey leaned forward and placed her hand over his, "Your sister's crimes aren't yours. You've signed the Accords, you've proved that you're different." "But that isn't enough!" Pietro snapped, though he looked guilty when Honey flinched away from him, "I mean, I feel like, going to court, it could help for when the Rouges are brought in..." "It would create a precedent for putting an Enhanced on trial." Tony agreed, "We can talk to the people at The Hague, as they're the ones in charge of trying people on the Accords. You're sentence might just be house arrest because, well, death does make people a bit more lenient." Laura glanced around the table."But surely this conversation can carry on tomorrow gentlemen? I believe that we promised the children a stress free night." Rhodes agreed and the adults quickly cleared up the table and headed down to the movie room, though the colonel didn't miss Pietro mumbling an apology to Honey, or Tony tapping away on his StarkPad.

Secluded 'Safe House', Wakanda
Wakanda was hot.Very hot.That may have been an oversimplification, but Sam could remember cooler days in Iraq.Steve and Clint seemed to be permanently pink and Scott wasn't faring much better. Only Wanda didn't seem to be suffering but Sam wasn't about to ask for tips."Can't we turn the TV back on?" Scott asked, a slight whine in his voice, "I'm sure that Stark wouldn't have done anything stupid in the past week." The others all exchanged glances and, when Steve shrugged, Clint grabbed the remote and turned the TV on. No one was happy with the view on the screen. "Hello and welcome back to the second day of Pietro Maximoff's trial at The Hague..."
