 Tony has a bad reputation for poor self-preservation skills, something that is not going to be improved when he offers his new resident killing machine a new arm, essentially equipping Barnes to kill him with his own tech.“What…what is this?” Barnes asks, voice quiet. His confusion is guarded and cautious, but the way his eyes rove over the prototype arm says it all: He’s interested, and despite the actual purpose of this, Tony feels a surge of pride.“I know you want the arm reattached,” he replies. Barnes stiffens. Tony ignores it. “But that Hydra arm’s shit so I’m making you a new one.”There’s a barely-there ease to his shoulders, but Tony doesn’t pay it more attention than necessary. He’d been right about this being a good olive branch, and that’s all he needs to know.Barton cajoles, “What about me, Stark, I need new arrows pronto, this government quality is –”  “Look it over,” Tony continues ignoring the archer, eyes trained on Barnes who still – despite living in Wakandan luxury for the past month after his defrost, and in the Compound in relative comfort for another month – still looks unkempt and greasy. “Tell me what you think, what you want, and we’ll go from there.”Barnes stares back, brows furrowed in disbelief, and Tony worries for a second that the other man can hear just how much Tony doesn’t actually want to do that, even if it had been Tony’s decision to in the first place.Tony did shoot the Hydra arm off, at the very least he can replace it.In another life, Tony wouldn’t have done shit for Barnes, but Tony’s also done enough reflection in the past year to know better than to blame Barnes for the things Hydra had forced him to do. Even if Tony’s still fighting off a panic attack right now because this is still the man who killed his mom.Barnes blinks slowly before nodding his agreement, Tony huffs in relief and walks out, still pointedly ignoring Barton’s heckling.Less than a week later, the prototype reappears in the workshop with several notebooks filled with mathematical equations and diagrams.Tony peruses the pages with a hum.Barnes had taken measurements; did calculations; adjustments, and basically written a dossier on the prototype-arm and all the ways it could be improved to ensure it functioned a hundred percent, both with the super serum’s capabilities and Barnes’ own physical strengths and weaknesses in mind.It almost completely did away with the necessary consultations Tony would have to go through with him and took care of some of the legwork of adjusting the prototype before getting down to actually making the arm.It’s a relief, and a bit of a turn on.Tony really doesn’t want to examine that too closely.---It takes a month before Tony physically needs Barnes for the arm’s fitting, and that’s when he realizes that Barnes has a Thing with a capital “T”, and Tony pretends he doesn’t care because why should he? Barnes is a Super Soldier Super Assassin that sent Tony through the emotional and physical wringer since day one (or negative day 7092, if he’s being honest) and given him grief on every level since, why should Tony care that Barnes is punishing himself? Tony's already replacing the arm – he’s already housing, feeding, and clothing him out of pocket because the government can’t be trusted with someone of Barnes’ skillset – he’s already protecting Barnes more than anyone else has, why should he do more?The conclusion that Tony comes up with is this:Bucky Barnes has been through the very definition of hell on earth. He’s been broken and unmade over and over again from the day he was drafted for war to the day Zemo forced him to bear witness to the extent with which he had become more weapon than man; to face the fact that he’s been more puppet than human for seventy-odd years, to realize that he’d only been caught up in that whole Civil War fiasco after almost being free because he was just another tool to be used.After all, who was Bucky Barnes in exchange for the Winter Soldier?Tony knows the feeling – Merchant of Death and Iron Man, yes. Tony Stark not recommended – and really, that’s why because at the end of the day Tony understands and empathizes and – he hates it. He does.They’ve both been through way too much shit that they didn’t ask for, didn’t deserve, and it isn’t fair to hate Barnes, it isn’t fair to punish him. But god help him, Barnes seems to be doing a pretty good job himself:Since their sessions with the new arm, Tony notices the way Barnes will deprive himself of actual nutrition, how he’ll bleed out until the serum kicks in, how he’ll only sleep when he absolutely needs to and how he’ll train until his body gives up on him and collapses from under him.The crazy thing is, he isn’t even hiding it from anyone.Barnes isn’t Steve’s Bucky, and he has no one – has had no one since the fall from the freight train – and that’s why Tony cares, probably always had since he caught that glint in Thaddeus Ross’ eye. Because maybe no one else will.After that, T
