Chapter 1





Chapter Text
John Winchester’s brown eyes narrowed onto his daughter as he noticed the mark she bared on her pink torso. He knew what that was.Samantha Winchester has her Words.Her Soul Mark.His eyes squinted at it. He could barely read it since it was in messy hand writing and covered in remains of his wife. Sam was just born only a minute ago and John was now worrying over what jackass would be bonded to his daughter.He took a closer look at it a month later when he was giving her a bath. It was scribbled on in blocky letters that flickered a topaz color. Since the handwriting was pretty bad and looked like it has been written by a kid, which put his mind at ease. He knew that since Sam was born with the mark means that her Soulmate is older than her. At least he knows her Soulmate is not that older than her?  Samantha was eight when her mom died…well was killed. Dad owed money bad. Dad was out on a hit and Dean was at the birthday party of a girl he liked. So it was just and her and her mom baking cookies. After baking the cookies, her mom told her to go take a bath upstairs.After she did, Sam was on her way down. As she made her way to the kitchen she noticed a man there holding a gun towards her mom. Sam stood frozen not knowing what to do. The only thing that ran towards her mind was What would Dean do? He would run head first, probably. Sam was thinking smart but the only thing she could do at eight years old was cry.“Honey, leave the house and go next door, please,” her mom pleaded with her youngest who was tearing up. Sam knew one thing. She was not leaving her mom her. “Please, Samantha,” she begged.“No!” Sam cried out and as she ran towards her mom the sudden Bang stopped her in her tracks. Everything slowed down. She saw the bullet go through her mother’s chest. And at such a close range didn’t help either. Her mom fell to the hardwood floor and Sam dropped to her knees with her not knowing that there was another man there. That the other man was pouring gasoline everywhere even on her and her mom. The match he threw over the gasoline soaked sofa and the goons left leaving a weeping little girl and her dying mother but not without saying, “Tell your dad this is a warning.”“Please, leave, Sam,” her mom begged. Sam ignored her but ran towards the phone on the wall and called the police. They said for her to get out the house. So that’s what she planned on doing.But not without Mary Winchester.Sam had never felt so weak in her life. Why? Why did this happen? Why Mom? Why not…not me? Don’t die, please, don’t die, don’t die. I’m so weak. So weak…After that night, she never looked at her father the same way again. “What do your Words say?” Sam asked at the age of ten. She was sitting at the old table in Motel 6 while her older brother was watching Friends. She noticed that he will always turn it when his father would come home shitfaced. Dean just looked at his younger sister with a questioning stare. They usually never talked about their words. Sam would always stare at hers in the mirror trying to read it. She recalled Dean telling her last year that her Soulmate was at least five years older than her.“Why are you askin’?” He said. Sam always wondered. She caught a glimpse of it when he was changing. It was on his chest and it was short. About five words actually compared to Sam’s which had to be at least ten words or more. As for Sam’s was now a golden hue when caught in the right lighting, Dean’s was a beautiful blue. Bluer than a summer sky with no clouds.“You don’t have to tell me,” she said.“Its alright, Sammy,” he said. Dean rubbed his chest before saying, “Hey, ass butt, that’s my older brother you are insulting.” Which made Sam cracked a smile. Of course, those are his Words. “Her name is Castielle.”“Can you read mine’s?” she asked him in a soft voice. Dean sighed but nodded. Sam leaped up and lifted her tank top slightly showing her flat stomach.Dean squinted his eyes and then a smile appeared. “Your Soulmate seems like a douche. It says, ‘Hey, Tall, dark, and sexy, you’re lucky I like the way you lick that sucker because I would have kicked you out of my shop for saying that.” Sam couldn’t help but blush. So the love of her life is a flirt. She can handle that…she thinks.   Hey, tall, dark, and sexy, you’re lucky I like the way you lick that sucker because I would have kicked you out of my shop for saying that—Gabriel.Gabriel. She finally had a name.She stood in the motel bathroom in only a sports bra and sleep shorts. She couldn’t keep her eyes off her Words. They weren't golden anymore. It glimmered darker. Almost a burnt color. Sam looked up why Words change because Dean’s Words was not blue anymore. Dean came to her with glassy eyes asking her why his Words was burning. Why he could hear a voice. A pleading voice that scared the shit out of Dean. Sam hurried to the library and searched.“She’s lonely?” Dean repeated what Sam had explained to him.“Something must have happen
