Â ~*~Tony Stark was just, irksome.Steve had grown up in Brooklyn, surrounded by love and care and on occasion, bullies. Bucky had kept him sane, along with his family. He was grounded, his need to punch the biggest guy in the room fed by friendly smiles.Now Bucky was gone, everyone was gone, and Steve's rage had evolved into something much much more; something scary and dangerous.He was a man fueled by loss, and a man so desperate to find the missing pieces was a dangerous one.Some days Steve wouldn't even allow him to have contact with Stark, because he was always ready (wanting) to hit someone, and it had been decided by the universe that the two of them would piss on each other any chance they got. Steve knew his strength, at least tried to remember it, and he knew that Stark was a head shorter than him, definitely seventy pounds lighter; Tony was weaker, and Steve had promised himself after he had been given his new body, he'd always watch out for the little guy, because not a lot of people tend to.In comparison, Tony was the little guy. It made Steve feel horrible, a disgrace, some sick and twisted sort of evil; he was taking what he was given and using it for wrong, or at least, he'd thought about it.Steve was a sick enough bastard to think about hurting the man who made his blood boil, but he wasn't sure if he had it in him to actually attack.He was lonely, under pressure, and constantly on edge. Steve had an entire team relying on him - minus Stark, the man seemed to rely on nothing but caffeine and booze to get him through life. It was a difficult life, this new one that he seemed to step into, and it had only gotten worse when Stark had waltzed into the picture, followed soon after by an army of Chitauri.If Steve prayed for Tony every night, well, he would never admit it.It seemed like something as drastic as a miracle would be the only thing to change the man.#As Stark fell from the sky, seemingly lifeless, Steve hadn't thought about the things he'd hated about the man.The way he carried himself, as if he was better, the way he was so smart and hell bent on showing everyone that. Stark was always rambling about this and that, and it was so annoying because Steve didn't know what was happening and he didn't like not understanding. Stark was always taking risks and showing off. Never following orders.He was a child, a genius, billionaire child.Steve had never liked kids all that much, simply because they hadn't liked him.Then, Tony being the child that he was, had gone off and done something stupid, during battle, nonetheless."Wait," Steve had said, utterly confused as he pressed into his com, "Stark, these things are still coming."Stark's voice had been confident, and if Steve had heard the terror there, he surely didn't point it out, "I've got a nuke coming in and it's going to blow in less than a minute."A moment later Stark had merely murmured into the coms, sounding less sure of himself by the minute, "And I know just where to put it."Stark had attached himself onto that damned explosive, hanging onto the belly of it and propelling it - and himself - upwards, towards the giant gaping hole in the atmosphere.Steve was a sputtering mess, because a child shouldn't risk their life; it wasn't characteristic of someone so obsessed with themselves to put their life on the line for others.That was the moment that Stark had become an enigma, as unpredictable and dangerous as the nuke in his fucking hands."Stark," Steve had uttered, "you know that's a one way trip."It wasn't a question, because Steve had known and Tony had most definitely known.The entire world had known.Steve had just reminded him of what he was about to face, because he didn't want the man to do something he would regret (even if Steve knew firsthand that Stark didn't even consider acting on the things he didn't absolutely want or have to do).Steve and the team knew that he had to if they had any chance at saving the civilians below. Stark had realized this before them, and that's why his voice had grown soft and serious, a sharp contrast to his normally jovial tone.Stark hadn't replied back, and Steve hadn't really expected him to; he had known what it was like to fly into death, it just so happened Tony was going up and he had been going down.Steve bet the view was extraordinary, and kept that thought in his mind as Tony flew higher and higher. The captain refused to mull over all of the things he had regretted saying, because it would do no good now. The damage was done, and he had caused enough.A half assed apology out of guilt - and by God was he guilty - would do nothing to sate his conscience, and he highly doubted it would do any good to Stark.Moments later, Stark was flying above both him and Thor, over the Hulk's head, and up the side of his own home before descending into the oblivion above them.Steve could see the darkness from the ground, and could only imagine the hell Stark would witness.As fast as he had went u
