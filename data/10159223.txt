Chapter 1: Webbed and Bound
    




Chapter Text
It all started, as these things tend to do, with a late-night web-slinging. Spider-Man had had no way of knowing who the man was when he'd seen him on the construction site, flailing precariously  but silently from a girder jutting out from the dizzying heights of an unfinished section of skyscraper.  The spider sense had registered nothing outside the normal level of danger posed by a person hanging on for dear life, and he'd swung in to help with his usual blend of speed, wit, and agility. “Nice night for hanging around, isn't it?” he quipped, planting himself vertically on a support just across from the trapped man.  “Though I have to say, this is taking it a little too far!” The man sighed heavily as the wall crawler threw an arm around his waist and hoisted him, fireman style, over his shoulder.  “Very funny,” he grumbled as Spider-Man swung out from the scene with him in tow.  It was several moments before the web-slinger landed, rooftop on a nearby building considerably closer to the ground.  “Don't quit your day job.” “Ah, gratitude and good taste,” Spider-Man replied, crouching slightly to set his burden down.  “That's how I make it through the week.  Mind telling me what you were doing up there?  I mean, I hate to tell ya, but Mount Everest is on another continent.” The man shrugged, and that was when the spider sense elevated ever so slightly.  “Difficult week,” he said, backing up a step... toward the roof's edge. “Hey, what are you doing?” Spider-Man demanded, stepping forward and reaching for him.  His spider sense was buzzing more persistently now, but it didn't outweigh his concern for the man who seemed determined to splatter himself on the pavement. “I'm sorry, fella,” the man replied, jumping backwards off the roof as Spidey's danger sense suddenly rose to a nagging crescendo.  Something was going on behind him, he could now tell, but as he thwipped a webline at his descending target, his inertia pulled the wall crawler forward toward the roof's edge, impeding his ability to react to whatever was behind him. As his internal alarm continued blaring, Spider-Man halted his quarry's descent, then quickly surged a burst of strength through the webline to pull him up through the air.  With luck, he could catch the man and move out of the way at the last second.  But time seemed to slow interminably as the man flailed in the air, rising slightly above the wall crawler before curving back down.  Spider-Man sunk a shoulder under his abdomen, caught him, steadied him onto the roof... ... and that's when something pierced the back of his shoulder. The effect was immediate.  Strength drained out of the wall crawler, and suddenly the man he was rescuing—again—was far too heavy to support.  Spider-Man crumpled to his knees, reaching back to pull the offending dart from his shoulder.  It was as bad as he'd feared. “Tranquilizer,” he breathed, still not wanting to believe it. “Don't worry, webhead,” the man said, steadying the wall crawler.  As vision and awareness drained slowly from the Manhattan hero, he could barely hear the man above him, saying, “You'll have awoken to worse than this.”                 *            *            * A wave of clarity that came back to him with surprising quickness as he gradually stirred.  The room he was in was dark, but far from absolutely so; he could see very clearly.  He was laid out and bound, arms extended above his head and tied off at the wrists behind a board of some sort.  A brief struggle against them yielded no freedom, but he didn't worry about it.  His strength would surely be back soon. The surface he was laying on was quite comfortable, he noticed; it must have been a bed of some sort.  He stared placidly up at the ceiling, marveling at the height and the deep browns of the wood finish.  The place seemed vaguely familiar, but it wasn't as if he hadn't been inside a lot of different houses in his life.  Fighting crime, for better or worse, let to a lot of breaking and entry. “So, you finally awaken,” an accented voice said, from his right. Snapping his head in her direction, Peter laid eyes on a foe he dreaded seeing again, on several levels.  Calypso Ezili stood  next to the bed, at the head, her arms crossed expectantly as she leered vindictively at him.  She wore little, which was typical for the Haitian-born voodoo witch, the total sum of her clothing amounting to one or two strips of leopard-print cloth strategically placed to cover the statuesque features on her smooth, dark-skinned body.  A flimsy swipe of such cloth covered her front at the waist, leaving her otherwise naked. “Calypso,” he wanted to say, “so good to see you again!  Still got tiger's eyes covering your naughty bits.  How's that treating the old self-confidence?" He wanted to say all of that.  Instead, what came out was a toneless, scratchy, “Hhhkkkkk...” As Peter stopped and wondered why his throat and mouth weren't working, Calyps
