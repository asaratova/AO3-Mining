Chapter 1: TEA PARTY
    




Chapter Text
Hanamiya held back a sneer. If his team and classmates could see him now, his reputation would be ruined for good. Why? Because his baby sister, as cute as a button, had him playing tea party. (Name) was a queen and Hanamiya had to be a princess because, god damn it, the little girl didn't have any kingly crowns. Or she hid them and claimed there were none- the kid was evil like that.
Besides the crown and pretend tea drinking, Hanamiya also had make-up on his face. Behaving like a good big brother, Hanamiya had let (name) cake their mother's make-up all over his face. He didn't want to look himself in the mirror but a few glimpses he did take, sent shivers down his spine. He looked worse than that crazy ass Joker!
"No, Mako-chan!" The little girl snapped, looking as menacing as a lady bug. "Ladies sit with their legs together not like that! And you should smile!"
Hanamiya sighed, cursing the saints even as he did what (name) ordered him to do. He even straightened his back, folding his hands in his lap- glittery, pink nail polish shining. Smiling sweetly, he gazed at (name). The annoying little shit was beaming at him as if he developed a cure for cancer.
"Makoto-kun!" Called their mother.
"WHAT?" The boy yelled.
"Your friends are here!"
"Brother," (name) whispered. "Are you okay?"

Kirisaki Daichi team knew their captain as a heartless bastard. He was a bully, a genius and a sadist of massive proportions (not that they were much better) so the sight which greeted them as they entered Hanamiya's bedroom was more than shocking. The guy's face looked like a rainbow puked all over it, his hands were adorned by bangles and a shitload of pink stuff and he was wearing a tutu...
Laughter was an appropriate reaction.
"Look, (name)." Hanamiya grinned savagely. "More people to play with you."
Until it wasn't.
