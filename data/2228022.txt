Chapter Text
Вы должны двигаться туда, где это безопасно. Was written down Darcy’s spine since she had been born, it was neat and precise handwriting. Her mother hadn't been able to tell her what it meant when she was young and curious. So what do you know, about astrophysics and stuff? Was just below her left breast, when those babies finally came in. It wasn’t as neat as the other, more slanted and a little more feminine, it was red which meant a platonic relationship. Darcy was glad to have at least on of her soulmarks was in english. It took her until high school to learn Russian and how to read and write cyrillic. She was excited then, when she could read the words down her back. So they wanted her to get somewhere safe. That was nice. Darcy had little time to think about it during school, or life. With her mother’s alcoholism and her fathers gaping absence well she started to think soulmates weren’t all that they were cracked up to be. So she shelved some of her dreams, and ignored her mother’s muffled sobs until she ran off to college. She started off in science, because hey someone was gonna ask her about astrophysics one day. Come to find out her lack of math skills carried over into higher education, who knew? So poli-sci it was. And she liked it. Lots of history and debating and realizing what kind of scumbags run the political scene in general. In her senior year she needed an internship. “So what do you know, about astrophysics and stuff?” Said Jane Foster her hopefully new boss, and Darcy started, her platonic soulmate. “I’m more hip on the stuff part.” She answered through the haze of amazement. The grin that she got in return made Darcy want to dance. “So you’re my non-romantic life partner?” Darcy then asked and Jane started to laugh. Darcy smiled wide, sure she would tear her cheeks. “You got the job, forever.” Jane said suddenly hugging Darcy. And it felt right, it felt like she had known Jane her whole life and a day. Like this is what soulmates were like. But she threw that thought away because, after all her parents had been soulmates. Then storm chasing, and alien Princes and the loss of her life long pal, and her Ipod. Darcy took this all in stride. Because really, what else was she going to do? Stupid big brother government agencies and their superheros.   When Thor turned out to be Jane’s soulmate Darcy was happy for her, because really Jane needed some nice man in her life. But she was now, officially the third wheel. But she wouldn’t abandon her non-romantic life partner, because she had found a romantic life partner. Darcy was secretly happy when he didn’t come back. Excluding New York, where Thor didn’t even come near them (meaning Jane) and saved the world from evil aliens, and apparently his psychopathic brother. Then London. Fuck that stuffy city, that ruined her peace. And those weird elves. And really what kind of joke was that. Not one of them looked like Legolas. But Thor is back, which Yay no destruction of the universe. (But also, FUCK!, because now Jane stared mostly at his pectorals and not at her machines which Darcy kept running thank you very much.) Thor took Jane to the newly named Avenger’s tower. (After SHEILDRA self imploded with the help of star spangled rage.) It was weird, because Jane knew she would come. Hadn’t actually asked her but still. Jane was her non-romantic life partner, and all she really had. Darcy ignored that fact. (Pushed her mother’s suicide to the back, dark corner of her mind. She hadn’t even told Jane.) You know the fact that if Jane decided she didn’t want her around anymore Darcy would be alone, and with the way Thor and Jane were revolving around each other. The way Darcy saw Jane only in the labs now, the way Jane had cut her out of her life. (Darcy knew this would happen, soulmates never worked out in her world.) Darcy sat, curled on her couch in her impossibly huge apartment (floor). She half watched Super Nanny as she actually starred out of the window, chewing her lip raw. She had never really thought of her loneliness before, not before she had Jane. Before she was content to be alone, and hell it had worked like a charm.  Jane was pulling away, and Darcy could see why. Thor loved her like Darcy could never. The glass of vodka and orange juice (her breakfast, don’t tell Jane) was clutched between two hands. She had told herself not to get attached. This is what happen, the Lewis women always went to booze, and she didn’t want to be her fucking mother. But four months in, and everything was static, and she was alone. Finishing the drink she put the glass in the sink before she threw it just fo
