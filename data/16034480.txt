Chapter Text
Antonia Stark was a 3-year-old little girl when she first created a circuit board, unfortunately, Howard was unimpressed and proceed to ban her from his lab. She learned what it meant to be strong and to not to cry when weeks after that, her father submitted her to a lot of different tasks, most of them including being handed hot or sharp objects, she was a Stark so she had to be made of Iron. She was 4 when her mother showed her the power of ‘inocence'; the board members of SI didn’t even see it coming, but when she got them to agree to Toni being the youngest stockholder with only a soft voice and her eyelashes, was when the little girl understood that strength and power can have many forms.Antonia was 6 her mother and her aunt became her heroes, she wanted to be more like Maria and Peggy, and she decided that Antonia or Toni was a too much of a male name for that, so secretly (without Howard noticing) she changed her first name to Natasha, Natasha Antonia Stark.Natasha was 10 when her parents and Jarvis died in a car accident. She cried, but only for her mother and her dear butler, even at that age, she understood that Howard was too much of a drunk and beating bastard to deserve her pain. She was 11 when she had to learn to be more mature, she let Obie control SI with the condition that she'd spent time there learning, so she had to divide her time between MIT, socialite life and SI, and if it wasn’t because of Rhodey, aunt Peggy and aunt Angie, she would have probably collapsed.Natasha was 14 when she first had sex, she was somehow in love with this Tiberius 'Ty' Stone kid, barely older than her for 3 years, so she let him convince her of giving her all; he broke her nose a month later during a fight, Rhodey broke both of his hands and Peggy made sure to destroy his life. She was 15 when she created JARVIS, she also met Pepper and decided that she would be her best female friend, and it was around the same time when both of them started working on Stark Industries while she pursued her second PhD; Natasha thought she knew everything about her father's industry so far, she created new weapons and sell them to the US army, she was really grateful to Obie for handling things there, she was wrong.Natasha was 17 when she was kidnapped by the ten rings. She was held in a cave along with Yinsen for 3 months, being tortured until she agreed to recreate the Jericho missile, before escaping with Mark I and a piece of metal deep in her chest. She couldn’t save Yinsen though, and she mourned him for months, finally creating a whole new research and development department in his honor: clean energy.After seeing the Ten Rings’ lair full of her weapons she made the decision of closing the weapons manufacture. She made the public announcement right after she let Rhodey know, he was mad at her, but he would come around once she explained to him the reasons. The board wasn’t happy either and they try to use her underage to their advantage, but Natasha hadn’t forgotten her mother’s lesson, so she used her puppy eyes, making the most of her childish features, and her stubbornness to convince them. She was as sweet as she could to get them to listen and then she proceeded to explain the type of change she wanted to make in SI, that they didn’t want to be remembered as the greatest murderers in history, but as the ones who made a good change in the world. She talked with the passion and conviction that she had seen in her aunt Peggy and if by the end of the board meeting they weren’t fully convinced, she asked them to give her three, no, two months to raise the stocks to a whole new level than ever, and that if she couldn’t do it, they could be back to make weapons. Day and night she worked hard to accomplish that, she didn’t want to sleep anyway, the nightmares about water and her new arc reactor being present almost everytime she closed her eyes. Following the change in SI, she created Mark II, everything was a blur after that. She was almost 18 when she learned about Obie’s betrayal in the worst way possible and it was purely in spite that she dragged herself to her spare arc reactor and went after him.
It was, surprisingly, the first time she followed an order and she didn’t tell anyone she was Iron-Man“I want to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative” the SHIELD director went to her one night after JARVIS allowed him access to the Malibu house and proceeded to explain
“Uncle Fury, as much as I like you, I don’t really trust that much in spies and right now I have a lot on my plate” the girl made a pause, she didn't mention that she would rather talk to aunt Peggy before making any decision “I can be a consultant if you like”
“I’ll send you an agent to help you with your work then”
"And to spy on me?” Natasha smiled knowingly
Fury didn’t answer but his grin was enoughHer name was also Natash
