Moneypenny

 “S.H.I.E.L.D.?  Never heard of them.  American?” Eve glides into the room with her usual determined efficiency, planning to make a quick getaway after leaving the tray with the teapot and five cups on the desk.  M’s schedule simply says meeting at request of ISC (3x).  The Director had made the entry herself just yesterday, right after the secure call from Mallory, the new head of the Intelligence and Security Committee.  Eve has no context, and no agenda for the meeting -- but what’s a secret service without secrets, right?  The left hand not having clearance to know what the right hand is doing is a founding principle of the business.  What Eve does know, based on that cryptic entry, is that there will be three visitors.  Plus M and Bond – equals five cups for tea.  Good thing she went to uni. The head of MI-6 is pacing in front of the large window, her lips pursed in pinched disapproval.  What exactly she is disapproving of is not clear – the possibilities are endless, frankly -- but Eve suspects the mystery group whose name Bond just spat out tops today’s list. “You are not supposed to have heard of this organization, 007, and once we are done with this silly exercise, we will erase its existence from our memory.” M takes her special cup from the tray, thanking Eve with the barest of nods; a slight flicker of her steel-grey eyes makes it clear that the last comment applies to her executive assistant as well.  “S.H.I.E.L.D., I am told, stands for Strategic Homeland Investigation, Enforcement and Logistics Division.  A division of what is not clear to me, and I shudder to contemplate.  The only thing I do know is that despite the clever acronym and the reference to the Homeland, they answer to an international cabal called the World Security Council, not to the U.S. Government.  And before you ask, I am not privy to this Council’s origins nor to the identity of its members.  All I was told is that they represent the ‘collective interest of humanity’.  To what extent, what exactly they mean by that, and why the US tolerates them on their territory I have no idea.” Ah –hence the pinched lips and the rant.  If M hates anything, it’s not knowing everything about something.  Eve almost pities those S.H.I.E.L.D. reps, blissfully ignorant as they are of the arctic chill that awaits them. She walks over and holds out the tea tray to Bond. “It’s not poisoned, is it?” he asks, as he picks up a cup, with that roguish little smile that routinely brings lesser women than Eve Moneypenny to their knees. “Not yet,” she replies, with a similar curl of her lips.  Bond will never let her forget that she almost killed him once; she, in turn, likes to remind him that she still might.  (Trust is a volatile and highly overrated commodity in their profession, but its absence should not preclude collegiality.)M sets her cup down on her desk with an audible clunk and turns her back to the room.  The view of the river is obscured by a pelting rain, one of those that drain all colour from the London skyline.  Even the blinking lights of the BT tower have a hard time piercing the grey shroud. “In the meantime, however, Mr. Mallory’s Committee in its ineffable wisdom has assigned us to a joint operation with this … agency.  Why, and at whose initiative, I have not been told.” If M were to speak in thought bubbles, Eve is convinced the word ‘agency’ just now would have been dripping with something.  Acid?  Viscous green slime?  She sets down the tea tray with a delicate but audible clang, to remind M of her existence so that she can be dismissed.  If neither M nor Bond are supposed to have known about this S.H.I.E.L.D. outfit, then the less a mere executive assistant hears about it, the better, no?  (Plausible deniability, and all that.)  Of course, M knows exactly what Eve is doing and why, and is having none of it.  She turns around and fixes her EA with one of her command glares. “You, Moneypenny, will act as the liaison between them and us, on all matters of procedure, protocol and administration.  They are bringing one of their own for you to work with.  As for the operation… well, whatever it is, I have not yet been privileged to find out.”  Acid it is, Eve decides.  The carpet is practically bubbling. “But I am told it is to be kept small, and off the grid.  007, you and one of their agents will be the executive arm of this exercise.  And I expect both of you to make sure that I have as little as possible to do with my … so-called counterpart, Director Fury.” The phone rings – call display indicates reception -- before Eve has a chance to plumb the depth of contempt with which M manages to infuse the word ‘counterpart’.  The Director waves off Eve’s attempt to respond, and opens the comms channel herself. “Yes,” she barks into the hands free setting. “Three gentlemen to see you, Ma’am,” comes a clipped voice.  “Do you wish us to bring them up?” “No, thank you.
