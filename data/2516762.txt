Chapter 1: Welcome Back
    




Chapter Text
“You could just relax a little,” Bucky suggested, and Steve grit his teeth to keep from rolling his eyes.  “I heard that.”Steve frowned.  “Heard what?”“You make a noise when you’re trying not to roll your eyes at me.  It’s like a weird snort and grunt all rolled into one.”  Bucky closed the carton of eggs and added them to the grocery cart.  “And roll them all you want, I’m not changing my position on this.”“You’re acting like this is the nineteenth century and somebody’s about to lose their dowry,” Steve retorted, and Bucky actually did roll his eyes before he steered the cart into the dairy aisle.Steve sighed at his back and scratched his fingers through his hair.  To be as fair as possible (even though Steve felt a little like somebody’d lit his heart on fire and then forced him to hide the light under a bushel), Bucky was at least half right about their engagement.  Sharing it with even one of their friends guaranteed that the rumor mill’d start churning, and suddenly, their relationship’d belong to everyone; Stark, Darcy, and Jessica Drew’d clamp down first, of course, but the rest of the staff, their heckling, and their inevitable comments about sex toys and self-warming lubricant would follow right behind.  Never mind the parents and students who’d sniff it out in record time and open them up to god-alone-knew what other color commentary.  And none of that even considered Natasha’s sudden silence, or her distance, or the way she’d drifted past them in the hallway like a red-headed ghost.But at the same time, a guy only got engaged once in his life.  (At least, Steve hoped that’d be the case for him.)  And when he loved you as hard as Bucky did, as loyal as Bucky did, it was natural to want to shout it from the rooftops, right?“You can’t blame me for wanting to shout about this from the rooftops,” Steve said a minute or two later, and Bucky jerked his head up from his very serious study of non-dairy creamer.  His jaw was tight, almost angling for a fight, and Steve sighed and rubbed the side of his neck.  “I’m not saying you’re wrong.  You might even be right about most of it.  But you’ve gotta understand where I’m coming from, Buck.”  When Bucky glanced back down at the containers of creamer, Steve nudged his shoulder lightly.  “Just put the Thin Mint flavored stuff in the cart and talk to me.”Bucky snorted.  “Maybe I wanted something new.”“You threatened to move back in with your mom when I bought the Almond Joy flavor last month,” Steve retorted with a little grin.  “You’re not fooling anyone.”Bucky shot him a sharp little look, but he dropped the bottle of Thin Mint creamer into the cart at the same time.  For a second, Steve thought he might walk off in another huff and abandon him there, but instead, he reached back and snagged Steve by his belt loop.  Steve grinned and let Bucky drag him along like that, all the way to and through the check-out line.  It maybe should’ve bothered Steve—not the public display of affection as much as Bucky’s silence—but every time their eyes met, he saw the storm brewing on Bucky’s face, in his far-away gaze.They’d barely carried all the groceries into the house before Bucky crowded up behind Steve and rested his head on the back of Steve’s shoulder.“I love the hell out of you,” he said, his voice low.  “It’s not like I don’t want the world to know it.  I just want it to be ours for a couple seconds, you know?  No comments, no jokes, no nosy questions about when and where and how many people and what kind of ring.  Just the two of us, no interlopers.”Steve grinned.  “You’re sounding like you wanna elope.”“If it involves you in thin linen pants on a beach, I am there,” Bucky returned.  Steve laughed a little, and Bucky kissed the back of his neck.  “I know it’s hard for you,” he said as he pulled away and reached for the grocery sack, “but it’s—”“As much about Natasha as everybody else?”  Bucky froze at the question, and Steve huffed a sigh.  “For the record, that didn’t exactly come out the way I wanted it to.”“What, you can’t handle being right for the hundredth time?” Bucky retorted with a shrug.  He tried to sound casual, almost disinterested, but Steve couldn’t miss the tight line of his shoulders or the way he kept his head dipped, his face half-hidden from view.  “I’m trying to be a better friend,” he said quietly.  “I texted her, I called her, and I keep getting the silent treatment.  Which, according to you, I deserve, but—”“I never said you deserved the cold shoulder,” Steve defended.Bucky snorted.  “Either way, pretty sure that ‘hey, got engaged while you were hiding from whatever’s eating you’ isn’t the way I’m gonna mend this bridge.”He shook his head, almost like when he cleared the cobwebs after a lousy dream, and for a few minutes, Steve just stood out of the way and watched him start filling the pantry with a sort of surgical precision.  If he kept his face tilted away from Steve a little, almost like he
