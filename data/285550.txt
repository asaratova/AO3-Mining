Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 

Charles Xavier is everything and nothing like Erik expected. Sitting in the farthest row of the lecture, that was surprisingly full  of students and professionals alike, he watched the small man at the  podium talk for nearly an hour about the evidence of lycanthropy. Everything the man said was direct. The fact that it would be a genetic  disorder, and the historic evidence pointing to it already being  present in the world. Much of the lecture revolved around the genetic  possibility and then later on the biological effects such a “mutation”  (as Xavier put it) would have on the human body. The  latter half of the lecture went a bit over Erik’s head. He wasn’t a  scholar; he didn’t have more than a high school education in biology,  but from what his superiors had told him it was all a little too close  to home. Which meant only one thing, either a fellow werewolf was  feeding the secrets of their species to this outsider or the great  professor Xavier had a pet he was experimenting onNeither was a good option, and it was Erik’s job to get to the bottom of it. 
    The  vast number of people in the audience was a concern. This was one of  the main reasons why Erik had immediately booked a flight from Miami to  New York to catch the lecture. People were 
listening
 to Xavier.  Some people in the audience even stood up to applaud the  man when he was done. Usually, any person who came to the public  announcing “werewolves are among us” would be laughed off the stage,  especially in an academic setting. But from what Erik gathered Charles Xavier was different. He was a well  respected scholar, with a PhD in Genetics and Wildlife Biology and had  opened his own wild life center on his family estate when he was only  twenty-five. Xavier was the leading scholar in wolf preservation in the  state of New York and on the East Coast. So, he was an activist,  scholar, and genius. He would not be laughed off a stage easily, and  when he spoke his words tended to get people to think. Which was why  Xavier was well received by so many people. A great deal of the werewolf  preservation society had admired him and what he did for the animals at  the center. Then he made the announcement of his latest thesis, and the  book that would shortly follow it. Erik  stayed in his seat while the auditorium filtered out. He watched as a  line began to grow from people stopping to shake the professor’s hand  and share a few words with him. Of course the end of the lecture had  been pitched with, “my book will be published and out within the month  if you would like more information.”  After  the initial crowd had dispersed, Erik moved. He stepped down the stairs  with quiet grace and settled into the line. There were two young girls  in front of him, obvious students, giggling and clutching an assortment  of books in their arms as they waited for their turn. When they  did  shake hands with Charles Xaiver, just a few inches away from Erik, he  overheard every high pitched comment they made. “We loved the lecture professor.” The black haired girl out of the pair said, almost sighing the words in one breath. “Did  you? Hope it wasn’t so boring?” came an amused reply, the same smooth  English accent Erik had listened to for nearly an hour. “Oh  it wasn’t boring at all. We’re fascinated with the idea that werewolves  exist. Tell us, do you know any?” the second girl, a blond peeped up.  The hope in her voice could not have been hidden even if she tried. The  question got another laugh, nothing mocking as Xaiver answered, “I  can’t reveal that girls.” followed immediately by sighs of  disappointment. “But I can say that the science speaks for its self.”  Erik perked up at the statement, eyes narrowed on the meeting in front  of him. “Such a tease Professor.” the black haired girl noted. “I’m glad your enjoyed your time. I’ll see you girls in class on Friday, I assume.” There  was a synced chorus of, “Yes” and then the two small bodies bumped out  of line. Their heads held low to hide the smiles of accomplishment that  adorned their young faces. Erik  tried not to have his eyes follow the two girls as they departed.  Instead, he stepped forward, stuck out his hand in greeting, and took in  the man in front of him. His target, he reminded himself. “Dr. Charles  Xaiver, it’s a pleasure.” Finally,  he got a good look at the man in front of him. Up close, the professor  was much smaller. He stood below Erik by at least a head, but his hair  looked longer, flowing in front of his wide baby blue eyes in an almost  messy way. When the professor’s hand came up to swipe the hair out of  his face, Erik could see how it suddenly became so messy. Then the hand  came down and clapped his in a warm friendly way. A charming smile  showed perfectly white teeth. “The pleasure is all mine.” “Erik Lehnsehrr,” he introduced smoothly.Charles’ smile stayed in place as he asked, “What can I do for you, Mr. Lehnsehrr?” The  lie came
