~~~~~~~~~~~~My movements were slow as I grabbed my textbook for my next class. I liked Gary Smith, the known sociopath of the school. I didn’t know why, but there was something about him that made me want to be near him. The only problem was–“(Y/n)!” Gary screamed.I jumped as I heard a hand slam into the locker next to mine. –He bullied me.“Come on, Gary. Leave them alone,” Jimmy cut into the conversation.I slowly turned around once I closed my locker shut to face Gary and Jimmy. Jimmy would always try to get Gary to back off, but I knew there wasn’t much he could do. My eyes were drawn to the floor tiles, my heart was leaping in my chest. What did he want from me? The scars I got at home were difficult enough to deal with…And now this?“I know you’re little secret,” Gary said. My eyes flashed up to his face. Gary…He was smirking. My hands began to shake as he leaned closer to one of my ears. “I won’t tell anyone about the scars on your back if you do something for me,” He whispered, smirking as he knew he won the fight. I swallowed the lump in my throat, My breathing was shaky.“I-I’ll do whatever you want me to, just please take a step back…You’re making me nervous,” I whimpered. His smirk only widened once I agreed to his ‘deal’.“Good, pet. Follow me,” Gary ordered. I let out another shaky breath and brushed past Jimmy, giving him a small glance before I followed Gary back into his dorm room. Gary lounged on his bed, the smirk slowly fell from his face as his watch beeped twice. “Dammit,” He mumbled to himself. I watched in fear and confusion as he pulled out a few pill bottles and swallowed 3 pills. He took a few deep breaths before he started talking, “Okay, now that thing you’re going to do for me…I need to ask you a few questions. You can relax you know, I’m not going to hurt you.” I scoffed and turned my body away from him.“I find that hard to believe,” I said to Gary, pissed about the situation. “Okay, you know how I always say how I’m so smart because I’m off of my meds now? Well, I lied. I started taking my meds because of that incident last year and I don’t want to get in trouble, so I’m keeping up my insane facade,” Gary explained.  Gary was always one step ahead of everyone, but could he really be telling the truth?“Why are you telling me this?” I asked, confused.Gary smiled and brushed his hair back with one of his hands, a playful smirk tugged at his lips.“My reputation…Is shit. And I need your help to fix it. I won’t tell anybody about the scars if you do this.” Why would I do anything for Gary? Sure, I liked him, but he had bullied me since the first day I got here. “Hey,” I turned to Gary, slowly unfolding my arms to hold my hands together in front of me. “I’ll give you a kiss if you do it. I know you like me…I honestly don’t know why since I’ve treated you like shit since you got here, but-” My eyes fell to the floor in embarrassment as I heard him rise from his bed to approach me. I wouldn’t have noticed if the floorboards weren’t so creaky. Gary slowly pushed me back into the wall, his body towered over me intimidatingly. “So what do you say? A two for one deal. I won’t tell anybody about your shitty home life and scars AND you get a kiss by yours truly if you help me raise my rep. How about it?” I wanted to say no, but I wanted to believe that he was trying to change for the best.“Why?” My voice was more timid than normal.“Why do I need to get my reputation up? Well, I-” I shook my head which grabbed his attention and halted his sentence in one single moment.“No, Well, I mean, I’d like to know, but that isn’t what I mean…Why did you treat me like garbage for so long?” I slowly glanced into Gary’s eyes to see him staring into mine as well.“Well, you’re cute, and you’re a person and I don’t know how to act around cute people without antagonizing them,” Gary said.  Gary’s hands quickly reached my face to cup it before he pressed his lips to mine. They were soft and sweet like candy. But, just as soon as the kiss came, he separated our lips. “Huh…” He mumbled to himself.Gary let his thumb brush over my lips, analyzing my actions. My eyes were wide, shocked by the kiss. “That was…A lot better than I expected,” Gary said, mostly to himself. Before I could move away from his arms, G
