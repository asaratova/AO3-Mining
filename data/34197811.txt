Chapter 1: Power Exchange - Tommy Shelby
    




Chapter Text



His eyes glistened in delight as he watched her move closer, spreading his legs for her to settle on his lap. Tommy was still wearing his glasses, sipping on his expensive whisky. It had been an awful day, the meetings have disappointed him, pushing him to his limits as he was losing his patience, ready to knock a few of those wankers to the floor.


“Do you trust me, Tommy?” Her nails scratched his scalp, messing up his carefully gelled back hair. He took another sip before placing his glass down, hands wandering up the back of her thighs. “By now it feels like you’re the only one I can trust, doll face.”

(Y/n) couldn’t help but smile at the man she was currently straddling, she had been waiting for this moment for weeks, planning her moves, trying to find the right words. But as he was sitting there, exhausted and frustrated, she couldn’t remember the sentences she had rehearsed for the past hours.

“Let me be in control tonight, I will take care of you.” The first button of his suit jacket plopped open, filling the silence that engulfed them. Tommy didn’t reply, nor did he stop her wandering hands, allowing her to undo his vest. Not once had he given up his control, he would be the one to shout orders, the one that would force her to her knees in the darkness of their bedroom.

“Do you think you can handle that?” His lips ghosted over hers, teasing her, not giving in just yet. (Y/n) tried to chase his lips, desperate to feel his skin pressed against hers, but the chuckle that clawed through him stopped her movements, reminding her of her so-called “mission”.

“Don’t ever underestimate a woman, Mister Shelby.” (Y/n) grasped his glasses and placed them down next to his whisky glass. Tommy tried to stay still, wondering how long she could keep the upper hand in their little game, she would break before he could sink into her - Tommy was sure of it.

“You won’t touch me, unless I say so. Are we clear?” Her voice wrapped itself around him, hips meeting his as she began to grind herself against his hardening cock. Saliva pooled in his mouth, he parted his lips to let a small “yes” roll off his tongue. Tommy couldn’t deny the excitement that rumbled through him, spreading like a wildfire that would burn trees to the ground.

“Good boy.” (Y/n) raised her hips to pull his trousers down his legs, underwear following shortly after. But she didn’t touch him, not yet at least. With a devilish grin on her lips she rose from his lap, plopping down in the leather chair that stood right next to his.

She didn’t break eye contact once, not even as she began to spread her thighs, exposing her dripping, naked cunt to his widening pupils. Her hands wandered to her heat, fingertips brushing through her slit, scooping up drops of her arousal she then cleaned off her skin with her tongue.

As Tommy’s hands began to move closer to his twitching cock she singsang his name, shaking her head. It was a warning, a simple warning he chose to ignore, hand grasping his length.

“Are you too dumb to listen to my commands? Seems like we need to tie you up.” (Y/n) tugged on his tie, wrapping it around his wrists within a few seconds. No longer did he feel like he could trick her, no longer could he put an end to her charade, he was trapped, and had to bend to her will. No man on the streets had ever seen Tommy Shelby giving into somebodies will, no sane man would live through moments where he'd watch Tommy Shelby turning weak.

“Now you will sit there like the good boy you are and you will watch me till I cum.” Once again she touched herself, rubbing her clit with her thumb, teasing her entrance. (Y/n) was putting on a show, a show for him only.

His piercing blue eyes stuck to her core, the glistening drops of arousal that gushed out of her, leaving stains on the chair. The moans that left her sounded sinful, like an unholy woman that found comfort in the devil’s touch, not following the good life, chasing the highs only the darkness could offer.

“Feels so good, Tommy. Almost as good as when you touch me.” He had his hands balled into fists, trying to find a way to slice through the rope, wanting to punish her for toying with him like that. But Tommy couldn’t deny that he felt high waves of lust clashing through him at the teasing undertone of her voice. He liked giving up his control, only to her.

She fell apart in front of his eyes, moaning his name over and over again. Her head rolled back, thighs spread even further, legs hanging off the armrests. (Y/n) lazily rubbed her clit, trying to hold onto the feeling, wondering how long she could drag out her game, would he snap or would he allow her to toy with him a tad bit longer?

“I think you’ve enjoyed that, didn’t you?” A chuckle left her as she pointed towards his cock, shamelessly twitching in anticipation, telling her all about his excitement.

Tommy nodded his head, trying once again to escape from the rope - though
