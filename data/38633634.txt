Description: A dark charcoal soap, scented with Russian tea, with a raspberry jam-scented deep red swirl. Top of the soap is decorated with a red and gold mica drizzle. Soaping notes:Ingredients- saponified olive oil, saponified coconut oil, Russian tea concentrate (water, T2's Russian Caravan tea), sodium hydroxide, castor oil, shea butter, cacao butter, charcoal, raspberry jam fragrance oil, red mica, brown oxide, gold micaThis was a true experiment, in that I made the Russian tea concentrate and used it to replace the water in the recipe, without knowing what would happen. I froze the tea concentrate and used a water bath to keep the hydroxide/tea solution cool, anticipating some exciting exothermic outcomes. I can tell you that Russian tea + sodium hydroxide does not smell good. The finished soap does smell pleasant, definitely like tea. I had colour issues with the first batch, which started dark brown and saponified to olive green, so I made a second batch with a lot more charcoal and oxide to get the black result.Probably not functional as soap because the amount of charcoal and red mica makes the suds strongly coloured, but it smells and looks lovely.
