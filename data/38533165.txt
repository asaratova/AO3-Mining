Chapter Text
When Tony closed his eyes in Siberia, he never thought someone would be watching. He was wrong. As soon as his body fell unconscious, a blue light grabbed him.       When Tony woke up he.....was in space.“What the !” He was so surprised...he was in space, surrenders by 6 giant blocks, each of a different color. Blue, green, red, purple, yellow, and orange. Tony couldn’t help but notice he was glowing orange as well !“What the hell is this !” “Don’t move, you won’t allow this to go quickly if you do !” Tony yelled as the orange crystal spoke. “Heh, I knew he was gonna react like that,” the purple one said.“I swear Power sometimes you’re like a child.” The yellow one groaned. “And I swear you’re like an old rock all the time.” The blue one said. “Could we all behave.” The orange said. “Time, how much longer ?”“Around...10 minutes he should be done.” The green one said. “Great. Greetings. Anthony Edward Stark.”“Eh hello.....ok. Who are you. Where am I ? Am I dead ?”“You are alive Mr. Stark. And your are at the Heart of Infinity. Space brought you here when we sensed your life was about to end.”The heart of Infinity..“What...are you ?”“We are the true forms of The Infinity Stones. Our physical bodies are just a tiny stone compared to us. Allow me to present them. The blue one is the Space Stone.”“We’ve met before. You know me as the tesseract.” Space said. “The tesseract is....Wow.”“The green one is the Time Stone. You have yet to come in contact with him, but he’s in good hands on your planet. Reality Stone is the red, your friend Thor had an encounter with her so,e years ago.”“And then those Asgardians left me in a hell hole !” “The Purple is the Power Stone...”“HELLOOOOOOO.”“Don’t Mind her, she’s exited all the time. The yellow,here is the Mind Stone.”“You’re the one in top of Vision !” “Indeed. A noble creature to hold my power. ““And I’m the Soul Stone. We are the infinity stones.”“Ok....but why am I here ?”“For the fight you have been preparing since you got me from the hands of Loki.” The Space Stone said.“New York...”“Indeed, only this time the true master mind will show up.”“Master mind ?”“Loki was nothing more than a pawn in all of this.the true master mind is a being by the na,e of Thanos.”“And your time to face him is running out.”Tony knew it, he knew that New York was not a one off like some others liked to claim.“In the universe there are only two beings that can carry the Infinity Gaunlet, one of light and one of dark. Thanos is the dark one...and you Tony Stark, are the Light one.”“Me !”“From the moment you were born, you were chosen as my champion.” The Soul Stone. “You are a special being Tony Stark, you will see it soon enough.”Tony stopped glowing orange. “I’ve healed your injuries. Now it’s only time for you to embrace your destiny. I’ll personally guide you for it.”“Wha...”“Now...wake up !”         Tony woke up gasping. On a hospital bed this time. His body no longer hurting from Siberia. “What the....”Tony then noticed he was holding something....an orange stone.“You’re story is only beginning....”
