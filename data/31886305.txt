Crepuscular 
 
***






James ‘Bucky’ Barnes woke up longing to kill something. That wasn’t new. After all, the urge to murder was one of maybe four emotions HYDRA had let him keep. So if you thought about it real hard -- and he had -- wanting to kill something was kind of his natural state. Well, these days it was more like ‘trying not to kill anything.’ Because James ‘Bucky’ Barnes was no longer the Winter Soldier anymore. Right? Right. Except inside his head, he still kinda was. Not -- not  really. But kind of. Because all the parts of him that had been the Winter Soldier were running like a well-oiled machine in there, just ticking along, and everything else had rusted away a long, long time ago.  oh, this is just awful,  Shuri had said, shaking her head and pointing to some scan of Bucky’s brain.  instead of targeting any of your actual synapses, whether collectively or as individuals, they gave up and just completely destroyed your parasympathetic response pathways, see? right here.  (In fact Bucky had NOT seen right there, but also hadn’t had the heart to tell Shuri that nope, he couldn’t read those scans, the inner workings of his own mind were completely incomprehensible to him.)  without those pathways you’ve got nothing but fight-or-flight, and no way to self-regulate. how crude! and imprecise -- i suppose that’s why they needed the code words to control you.  If Shuri had one flaw, it was that she sometimes got so deep into her science that she forgot Bucky was  standing right there --  and also, that she was always right. That time she’d been wrong, though: he’d had  way  more than just  fight  or  flight.  He’d also had  fuck  and  freeze. So, hey: that was four. Shove it all into the furnace and out came one brainwashed-to-order killing machine, ready to comply. 
 there is more scar tissue than there should be for this kind of procedure. did they do it more than once?  
He’d shrugged.  how many times, Shuri’d asked.  dunno,  he’d said.  pretty much anytime i started to remember. or ask questions. or think for myself.  It’d been simple, really -- sundown, out came the killer, ready to comply. And by daybreak -- well.  got wiped basically every time they took me out of cryo by the end there. mighta been seventeen, mighta been seven hundred.  That was when Shuri and Ayo had looked at each other with the kind of blank shock Bucky’d last seen on Steve Rogers’s face.  this procedure is not benign,  Shuri’d said.  it is essentially the total destruction of your grey matter. for your neural connections to keep growing back after this kind of butchery, through that much scar tissue and more every time, year after year…   right,  Bucky’d said.  i have a lot of scars.   of course you do, Shuri'd replied. but that is not what i meant.  Shuri was a fucking genius, so it wasn’t surprising that whatever she was talking about was going at least nine levels above his head, right -- like, it’d honestly felt like a homecoming of sorts, being the dullest and slowest person in that room -- and then Ayo’d jumped in.  you must be very strong,  she’d said.  or else you have very deep connections.  No, not really. Just the one. And it’d been severed the day he’d fallen from that freight car. Most of his work with Shuri herself had actually ended relatively quickly, considering. Three hours a day, five days a week spent in Shuri’s much-more-comfortable-than-the-Soviet-version brain zapper over six weeks and bada-bing, bada-boom, the actual  programming  was gone. But the neural pathways were still there.Seventy years of nothing but  fight-or-flight-or-fuck-or-freeze  meant that Bucky Barnes’s brain was still wired to kill or fuck or run away from things  all the fucking time.  He privately thought of it kind of like a glacier (because his brain was  also  wired for nothing but ice and cold, go figure): even if the spiky brainy ice river was gone, the gouges it’d left behind had transfigured his internal landscape beyond recognition -- and HYDRA had seen to it that he’d had no tools to dig himself out of the pit they’d thrown him in. So the hard part hadn’t been removing the programming itself, no. The  imperative  was gone more-or-less quickly -- but the compulsion to kill or fuck or flee was always there, like an itch in the back of his head he was longing to fucking  stab.  That was when the sessions with Ayo had started. we will begin with exposure-response therapy,  she’d called it. or at least that is the closest English translation.  what in the hell is that,  he’d asked. exactly what it sounds like,  she’d said, and then she’d said a bunch more things that he’d really, really tried to listen to, except that it really sounded like she was preparing him for -- and then she’d started recit
