 The avengers had been together for several years and if asked they’d say it was safe to say they knew just about everything about their teammates. They of course would be wrong about this considering no one had seen what happens when you give Tony Stark heavy painkillers. In Bruce’s defense, he honestly didn’t know he wasn’t supposed to assume Tony was just being difficult when he refused the meds. 1 “Bucky come on you know me.” Steve was trying to reason with Bucky Barnes who was still trying to push off the winter soldier programming and had until now not had any episodes.The former Hydra assassin didn’t look like he recognized Steve as the super soldier tried to reach him. Natasha, Clint, Sam, and Rhodey were trying to help at least by keeping Bucky contained to avoid him going on a murder path. Bucky however was Hydra’s best assassin for a reason. He managed to knock Steve down and then Natasha and Clint at the same time. He was nearly to the stairwell when a blurry eyed genius came up.“Tony watch out!” Sam warned but the genius didn’t seem to hear him.Bucky was about to attack Tony but all of a sudden the genius grabbed the former assassin’s arm and flung him around like Hulk had Loki leaving the floor in shambles. Thoroughly knocked out Tony left Bucky embedded into the floor and continued on his way.“Damn it who gave Tony heavy drugs? He’s not supposed to have strong pain medication.” Rhodey snapped like that explained how the normal human genius flung the other man around like he weighed nothing.“What the hell?” Clint asked as he got up from where Bucky had knocked him down.“Look, this is one of the better side effects of Tones getting heavy pain meds. Just avoid doing anything near him resembling an attack and you won’t be broken. I need to have a word with Banner.”Not believing Rhodey the spy twins followed Tony curious about his apparent super strength. When Thor slapped him on the back later the genius hadn’t even budged and punched Thor through three walls with little effort. Of course when Bruce found out that Tony really hadn’t been difficult and knew he had strange reactions to medication the good doctor had Hulked out. Turned out it wasn’t a problem as Tony one punched him into a KO. Natasha had decided she had seen enough while Clint just stared wide eyed and in awe. ~ 2 The second time Tony got pain meds it had been a prank by Clint. He hadn’t thought it would do any harm to have a super strength genius around and he thought it would be funny to see Tony punch Thor again leaving the god utterly confused.They were called out before Clint could see the results of his prank and unfortunately they were called out for Loki. The god was causing havoc as usual which thankfully meant he wasn’t trying to rule the planet again. This time he’d frightened an entire mall leaving people running and screaming as they attempted to get away from the god of chaos.“Brother stop your schemes!” Thor’s voice boomed loudly as he spoke to Loki who was leaning over a jewelry case no doubt about to steal what he wanted.Loki scowled at Thor about to snap at him when a familiar red gauntlet slapped Thor across the face. The thunder god stared shocked as he touched his cheek.“Man of iron-”“Silence you brute, how dare you speak so rudely to the most handsome and talented prince to ever grace this world with his presence!”Loki’s jaw nearly hit the floor while Clint could be heard cursing signaling to everyone else that whatever was happening it was his fault. Tony stepped out of his armor and pulled a bouquet of roses from…somewhere and presented them to Loki as he was on one knee before him.“My beautiful Prince Loki, please accept these roses that cannot even begin to match your beauty. It is truly a sin that no one yet has showered you in jewels and riches worthy of you. If you will allow me let me be the one to show the world you deserve to be spoiled with wonders no one else could even dream of.”“Tony what the hell are you doing?” Steve asked as he stood next to an equally shocked winter soldier who hadn’t expected this for his first mission since being cleared.“Silence you worthless heathen; you disgrace this prince with your unworthy presence.”Loki’s face flushed with a deep blush as he finally accepted the roses. Tony stood offering his arm.“Allow me to escort you to a more appropriate setting for one such as yourself. You will want for nothing when with me my prince.”To shocked by the situation the Avengers just watched as Tony escorted Loki like the perfect gentleman. By the time they recovered Natasha just pulled out her phone and dialed Rhodey.“Tony just charmed Loki, insulted Steve, and slapped Thor. What the hell is going on?”Natasha doubted Rhodey could sigh any louder.“Who the hell gave Tony pain meds? I keep telling you people not to but does anyone listen? He’ll show up again when they start wearing off.”Rhodey hung up clearly annoyed with them. Natasha gave Clint a murderous glare causing t
