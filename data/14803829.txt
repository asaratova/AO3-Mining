Chapter 1: confused acceptance
    




Chapter Text
The first time Tony invited Peter to the lab, he was surprised, to say the least.It took him a full minute to respond, due to the shock that ensued.
Why do you want me to come to the lab?
Tony was much quicker texting back than he was.
Just maintenance on your suit and all that. Upgrades. Messing around with protocols.
Peter’s response was immediate: Sure, that would be awesome!
K, kid, don’t wet yourself. Happy will pick you up after school
Peter blushed. He hadn’t sounded that excited.
Thanks, Mr. Stark
Tony, he corrected.Peter just smiled.“Is there something more important than your education right now, Peter?”Peter’s head shot up to meet the disapproving glare of his teacher.“No?” he said, returning his phone to his bookbag. “Sorry. Proceed.”The teacher sighed, turning back to the board.
