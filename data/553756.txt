His first mission with the Avengers took him to Latveria.“James,” Natasha said as he was standing framed in the doorway of the plane. She pursed her lips, thoughtful and calculating. “Are you ready for this?”Bucky looked down at the snowy mountains underneath him, heart thudding in his chest.No way in hell, no, he wasn’t ready.“Sure,” he said out loud. Natasha came up behind him – he could just barely hear the click-clack of her boots above the icy rush of the wind – and put a hand on his shoulder.“If you want to back out, you need to tell me now,” she said. He breathed in deep, icy air filling his lungs; the chill spread through his chest, down his arms, to his fingertips. He closed his eyes, just for a second, and he was sure that when he opened them again it wouldn’t be Latveria below him and he’d be on a train, not a plane, and Steve would be reaching for him.He opened his eyes.There was a castle far below him and everything that wasn’t snow was green and also probably robots.“I’m okay,” he told Natasha. “Let’s do it.”He glanced over his shoulder enough to get a glimpse of her dark eyes and red lips – and then she slapped him on the ass, once, and shoved him out of the plane.Bucky was pretty sure, he thought while falling, that he was never going to get used to the Avengers.

Rewind
Bucky woke up when he hit the water. It pulled him under, icy waves against his face, and when he opened his eyes everything was inky darkness. He hung there for a moment, stunned, and then he kicked upwards, arms thrashing until he broke the surface.The air was even colder against his face, and he gasped, big gulping breaths, as the water threatened to engulf him again.He clawed his way to the surface once, twice, a third time. That was when he spotted the wreckage, floating a few yards away. He blinked the water from his eyes and took a deep breath, pushing himself forward. He grabbed at it, fingers scrabbling for purpose – the fingers of one hand felt weird, and the wreckage creaked and crunched beneath them – and then he hung on, cheek pressed against the metal. He floated for what felt like ages.

Someone was speaking to him, but the words were foreign, and they slurred together into a meaningless mass. Bucky tried to lift his head but everything felt so heavy, and when he opened his mouth to reply, no words came out.There were hands underneath his arms, dragging him up, and Bucky felt himself falling forward.

He was on the train again, with Steve. With Steve’s shield in his hands and they were winning the fight and Steve clasped him on the shoulder warmly and said, “Bucky, don’t scare me like that,” and then Bucky knocked their shoulders together and they made their way into the next train car –

Except. No. That wasn’t right.

He’d slipped, hanging on by the railing, and Steve had reached for him, and --

Bucky blinked, sunlight filtering in softly through the window. He tried to sit up and something started beeping. Instantly, a woman was by his side. She was wearing strange clothes and she pushed Bucky back onto the bed with one palm, speaking a language he didn’t understand. Her tone came across loud and clear, though: stay in bed.“I don’t speak – what that is,” Bucky said, eyebrows drawing together.“Ugh,” the woman said, voice thick with her accent. “English.”“Where am I?” he asked. His lips were cracked and dry; he ran his tongue across them. The woman tapped at something above his head, dark eyes intent and focused. She wouldn’t look at him.He was feeling tired again, and he let himself sink back against the bed, the pillow under his head. The strangely dressed nurse cupped a hand to his cheek, briefly.“Rest now,” she told him.

The room was dark and Bucky’s eyelids were too heavy to open all the way.Somewhere to his right a man’s voice, deep and heavy, said, “And we are absolutely, one-hundred percent, make no mistake sure that’s him?”“Yes,” a woman said. Bucky shifted, turning his head to the side, and saw that her hands were resting on the railing of his bed. Her fingers were long and graceful; he had a sudden flash of them wrapped around a gun. “I think so.”“You’d better do more than that,” the man said. There was a pause, and Bucky’s eyes closed again. He felt so tired and so heavy. Where was he?Where was Steve?“He’s the right build. The right – age, somehow,” the woman said. “Though his arm is – sir. It can’t be anyone else.”Bucky wanted to open his mouth and ask what she meant by that – what about his arm? – but it seemed an impossible task.“Alright. I’m taking your word on this, agent; don’t make me regret it,” the man said, his voice resigned. “Prep him for transport. We’re taking our boy home.”

The next time Bucky woke up, it was evening and he was in a different room. The walls were steel grey and the light by his bedside was on. The strangely dressed nurse was gone and in her place there was a redheaded woman sitting by the side of his bed. She had somethi
