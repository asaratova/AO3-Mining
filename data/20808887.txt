Chapter 1: Crash and Burn
    




Chapter Text
-"Mandatory training sessions?""Yes.""Every Thursday afternoon?""Yes. I just said that." Steve responded, trying not to grow frustrated at Tony's insistent questioning and diversion to the matter.Tony narrowed his eyes, pursed his lips and folded his arms across his chest like a stubborn child who was refusing to go to sleep. God, Steve loved his boyfriend but he could be stubborn as hell.The team had been worried that the pair would act differently towards one another after they started dating, putting them and others in danger or compromising a mission. They had been proven very wrong when the two continued to bicker like children every time a mission came about."So what? We sit around and play monopoly?" Clint snorted from across the table, legs kicked up on the dark oak table."Bagsy banker." He quipped after Tony, face in a smirk. Natasha not so subtly rolled her eyes, pushing Clint's legs down with a simple flick of her wrist."The fact is we need to evaluate how our team works together and-"A loud crash cut off Steve's sentence, followed by a groan from the person who had just fallen out of the ceiling."What the fu-""Clint, shut up." Steve quickly said, mind flashing with 'Spy. Listening. Stop.' But just as he was about to open his mouth to ask who this guy was and why was he listening into private Avengers meetings he caught a glimpse of the boy’s face.This boy was a child, no older than fourteen.Steve’s mouth snapped shut, trying to observe every detail of the body that had just fallen through the ceiling of one of the most secure buildings in Manhattan. The boy had dark brown curly hair, long and unkempt, dirt and grease streaking through it as though it hadn’t been washed in a while. His face and body were skinny, unnaturally so, and he could see that by the way that his thin clothes were draping off his body. But the most alarming thing about this boy was that he had a large bruise planted across his jaw, deep purple and yellow standing out against his frightfully pale skin.The eyes blinked open, a soft groan escaping chapped lips as he tried to take in the room.Steve could sense Natasha going to pick the boy up, keep him detained whilst they got answers and he raised his hand to halt any kind of movement or speech from anyone in the room.“Oh fuck.” The voice from below him suddenly said, and when Steve looked down at the body, he saw that deep hazel eyes were gazing around the group of people in the room to varying degrees of fear.“Well, I’m dead. If you’re going to kill me can you do it quickly? I’d prefer not to suffer in my final moments.” Steve frowned, then, to the shock of everyone in the room the blonde crouched and looked the young boy in the eyes.“Hey, no one is gonna kill you.” He said softly, gazing down at the thin blue sleeping bag the boy’s lower half was still tangled up in from the fall.The boy squinted in disbelief, then said:“Fine but can you make sure that any injuries I sustain aren’t life-threatening: I don’t have health insurance.”“No one is gonna hurt you either-““Steve.” It was Natasha who had cut him off, eyes hard and untrusting at the child.“Oh, Natasha, come on.” Steve gestured to the boy to say: ‘him, really?’. “A child?”“I was a child.” She countered, stiff and prim.Steve paused, blinked a few times and for a second there was tense, unyielding silence before Steve sat in front of the boy (who was still squinting at the man in disbelief) with his legs crossed and his hands in his lap.“Jarvis, does this guy have weapons on him or anything that could harm us in any way?”“No, Captain. I detect no weapons of any kind.” Steve nodded, quick, and then glanced at Natasha to check to see if that met her standards.She still had the same expression on her face, but she didn’t say or do anything other than glance at Steve to carry on.“I’m Steve.”“I know who you are.” The boy replied instantly, still observing Steve with untrusting eyes.Steve didn’t respond for a few seconds, wanting to choose his words carefully around the child who had barely blinked since falling through their ceiling.“What’s your name?”“I don’t have to tell you that.” He responded again quickly, hands tensing underneath the material of the sleeping bag.“Okay, well do you mind telling us why you were in our vents?” The kid didn’t reply as quick that time, obviously deciding what to say as he looked Steve right in the eye.“I was sleeping.” He gestured down to the bag he was wearing. “Honestly I didn’t expect to be disturbed, I expected better structural integrity from Stark Tower.”And for the first time since Steve had begun speaking to him, the young boy took his eyes off Steve to look at Tony who was standing near the back wall, one iron man gauntlet on.“Why were you sleeping in the vents of the tower?” Asked Clint, voice kind and soft, no hint of interrogation at all.“I just love the atmosphere.” The child deadpanned sarcastically, eyeing Clint.No one knew what t
