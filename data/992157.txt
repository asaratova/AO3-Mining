Prologue
Stiles froze when he heard a car drive right up next to him and rolled down the window. He saw Derek run into one of the alleys that bisected this one, shifting back from his alpha form mid-run. He couldn't sense anything suspicious or werewolfy, but he did tap that spot on his staff to make it shrink and put it into his pocket. He had just dispatched a couple of rogue omegas, so granted, he did look crazy, with dead bodies around him, though he had come out at night this time. And admittedly, he had taken down the omegas in one of the more well known alleys in Manhattan. Only, he didn't want them messing up his college experience and the rogues would have sensed a druid living amongst them.“Stilinski, SHIELD would like to talk with you regarding that,” the man said, pointing at the dead bodies. “And a job opportunity.”“What the hell is a SHIELD?” Stiles retorted. “And how do you know my name?”“Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. We handle the Avengers,” the guy said. “Or well, Coulson does that,” he muttered.“Oh, you're the guys that operate from that building near Avengers Tower, right?” Stiles asked, curiously. His adrenaline was coming down from “And from that ship in the air; what do they call those things... right, the helicarrier?”The man in the car narrowed his eyes at Stiles. “You seem to be well informed.”“It's one of my specialties,” Stiles grinned.“Well, in any case, Director Fury would like to talk with you,” the guy said, pushing open the passenger door.“This won't take a while, will it? It's just, I have classes tomorrow morning,” Stiles asked.“Nope.”“Uh, mind if I call someone first? I don't make it a habit to climb into strange cars with strange people. Even if they claim to be from SHIELD,” Stiles replied.“Go right ahead,” the man said. “The car will wait right here.”Stiles turned around and glanced at the tall and broad shadow that he knew would be there; they almost had a near telepathic partnership now, Derek would have known to stand close by but not visible. “Derek! You can come out now!”“Stiles, what is it?” Derek stalked out of the overhang of the closest building and walked over to stand next to Stiles and wrapped an arm around his waist. Stiles sighed and leaned into the alpha, relaxing when Derek was nearby had become a common thing for him by now. “Is this man bothering you?”“No,” Stiles remarked, glancing between the guy and Derek, “he has a job offer for me.”    
1. Four Years Later
Tony paced around the entry hall as the Avengers waited for their newest SHIELD assigned agent. Steve, Bruce, Natasha and Clint were waiting in the hall with him too and he could definitely see that everyone was anxious. Agent Potter had taken four or five months vacation and Fury had assigned a new agent to them. They had taken to calling Harry, “Loki deterrent” and the job title had stuck.The first time that Thor had reported that his little brother had escaped, Fury had decided to hire a wizard. So if Loki did come back and target the Avengers, they would have someone to fight on Loki's fighting level. Tony and the others had been very surprised at the idea that wizards actually existed, but looking back, if gods existed, what else did? But they had all taken a liking to one Harry Potter and now, Fury had found one to take over while Harry was on vacation.But Tony guessed, putting up with the Avengers for a while, living at what was now Avenger's Mansion 24/7 was hard work apparently.... So, Harry had asked them, Tony guessed, had asked Fury for a vacation. And to make matters worse, Thor had gone to Asgard a couple of days ago, so no god of thunder to do the work of fighting Loki.Now, Steve had just ordered everyone up to Tony's penthouse to wait for the new arrival. Which Tony might have been offended over, but given that it was Steve and not Fury giving the order, he didn't voice any objections to waiting for the new guy. And when he had asked Clint and Nat if they knew anything about the new guy, they had said nothing. Not actually nothing, but they genuinely knew nothing about one Agent Stilinski. They hadn't even known that he had existed and for Natasha, that was pretty much rare. She had looked vexed about not knowing anything.“Sir, they are on their way up,” Jarvis chimed into the silence.“Thanks,” Tony muttered, watching as the others straightened up or stood up from the couch and walked over to stand by him. Steve, coincidentally, came to stand by Tony.Tony's eyes widened when the lift door opened. He hadn't known what to expect, but this? A kid fresh out of college? Did SHIELD really recruit that young? Did they blackmail the kid into doing this? The kid had short straight brown hair with brown eyes and was just in a NYU sweatshirt and jeans. Tony couldn't see any evidence of him being a wizard; when they had first met Agent Potter, he had obviously been a wizard as he had been wearing robes. But this one, he just looked like a no
