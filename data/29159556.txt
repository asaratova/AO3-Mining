Chapter Text
So here’s the thing: Steve’s just coming off a casual, impromptu run-in with Vincent in the elevator, who just so happens to be Nat’s current compromise set-up-prospect from Marketing: he has an eyebrow piercing rather than a lip ring (aesthetic, Steve, not something you have to learn to swap spit around), which Steve can appreciate in theory—he’s an artist, he gets aesthetics—and objectively Vincent’s an attractive enough man, slender, good cheekbones. Nice ass.Objectively.But the fact is Steve hasn’t been looking for anything like that in a very long time. Maybe not ever. He doesn’t believe in soulmates, despite what he shared with Peggy. She’d been there when there’d been no one, at a time when the world was changing; when his world was changing something fierce and he didn’t know which way was up, and through all of it she was a constant, red lips and keen eyes and ready to take whatever came. Steve admired her, Steve was attracted to her on every possible level, and Steve was a maybe more than a little enraptured by her, but they’d had what Peggy had called, one day in her bed in DC, a snowdrop love, and the artist’s soul in Steve had latched onto that idea: something pure, and fledgling, and beautiful—full of possibility, held close to the chest to keep from harm for how fragile it was in the new dawn.Steve’s not sure he agrees with her so far as she takes it from there—to insist that he deserves the full bouquet of spring through autumn, the rapture and impossible joy of it all that she’d had the privilege, the blessing of knowing, and that he’s meant to know, too, now that time’s been given him to find it.Steve’s not sure he agrees that he deserves anything like that, but he loves that she knew what he was feeling more than he knows any words to say as much, and it’s true: he doesn’t believe in soulmates, and hell if he’s looking for what he maybe does believe in—love, even half a bouquet, he’d take that. And it’s not even just the fact that he can’t think of love, the real thing, without knowing that winter would always come and the leaves would always die in the ice and wondering whether he might just blossom onward, onward, onward without, and he doesn’t think he can do that. He’s big enough to admit that to himself, and he’s small enough to know that if he can’t say it to Peggy, she sees through him like glass anyway but still: it’s not just that.It’s more that he’s still trying to find his way in this brave new millennium, and that’s difficult enough as it is; there’s no sense in adding to the struggle. Steve may like a fight more than is objectively healthy, but they didn’t praise his tactical prowess for nothing: one front at a time, when there’s only one man in the fray. Which brings him here: objectively knowing that one, Vincent’s a very attractive man who seems very kind; two, he’s not looking for bouquets, half or whole or otherwise; and three, he really does need to find some way to discourage Natasha in her absolutely unwavering pitch to set him up with someone.This is how Steve finds himself at Stark Tower, in Tony’s 73rd floor lab, on that particular day, at that particular moment, too lost in his thoughts to see danger when it’s lurking, when he should turn tail and run.In hindsight, they may have over-praised that tactical prowess of his.“You had your eyes on me for ages, Stark,” a voice echoes through the room, and it’s sweet and smooth like honey, or a midnight summer storm, and it quenches something in Steve that’s been aching, throbbing in every beat of his goddamn blood for tending and holding and sating, that’s been crying out forever, maybe, or else as long as he knows to remember anymore: it stops everything in him, takes a hand and makes a fist around the heart in his chest, fucking dangerous—It sounds like Brooklyn, and hot rain, and sugared-up coffee when sugar was scarce: and somehow Steve knows that’s not the only reason for it resonating in his bones along the same octave as home.“’Bout damn time you made an honest gentleman outta me.”“Correction,” Tony snips immediately, though he never looks up; it’s then that Steve realizes that the man who owns the voice made solely out of home, lying reclined in an oddly—given the trademark madness of any lab of Tony’s—luxurious seat before him has a cybernetic implant from the shoulder, moulded down about three inches, and Tony’s poking around the insides of what Steve would guess is the rest of the arm from the size, the shape, the intricate plates and the deft-looking fingertips at the end, elegant somehow even cast in metal. “The colonel had his eye on you for ages. He’s shy though, you gotta push him before he makes his move.” Tony, being Tony, infuses those words with every ounce of innuendo they can hold.Typical. “You can come in Capsicle,” Tony calls over his shoulder, and Steve wasn’t hiding, exactly,
