You’d think after years of hearing the same jokes it wouldn’t be annoying anymore but no matter who it was that teased you about it, it never stopped pissing you off. But then you noticed your heart skipping a beat when a certain someone weighed in on the topic as well.“All I’m saying is, you could probably go as Little Red Riding Hood with Clint’s kids and you’ll fit right in.” Sam looked up and laughed when you smiled and flicked him off. He gave Steve and Bucky their steaks before asking you how you wanted yours, quickly scrambling to try and grab his plate away from your hands.“Come on really? Are we five?” Sam watched as you ate his ‘specially made with love’ steak as he called it, already preparing the next slice for himself.“Should’ve thought about that before calling me pocket-size during the mission!” You spoke with a mouthful of food, earning a disgusted stare from Sam and a headshake from Steve. As you walked out, you turned around one last time to yell at Sam. “And for the record, I’m not short! I’m fun-size.” You made sure to dramatically bite off the steak before sitting a little further away from everyone. Quietly finishing your food, you said nothing for the rest of the barbeque, nodding at Bucky when he handed you a beer and sat next to you.“Hey, if that shit ever bothers you let me know. We could always fuck with his bird.” He smiled when you laughed at his suggestion. “Nah I know he’s just kidding. I mean, it pisses me off a little but I know he isn’t the high school bully you know. Besides, you just want a reason to fuck with him Buck.”Taking a sip from his drink, Bucky tapped on your knee before standing up.“Just so you know, I think it’s pretty cute.”Whatever you thought Bucky would say, that was the last thing on that list. Trying to not seem too embarrassed by the comment, you rolled your eyes at him. “What? That I’m short?” Bucky shook his head immediately before downing his drink and leaning down towards you.“No, that you’re shorter than me.” He whispered softly against your cheek, pushing away and smiling down at you when he noticed your flustered reaction.“Oh…” was the only thing you managed to breathe out, breaking eye contact with Bucky before staring at the bottle.“See you later fun-size.” You looked at him when he turned around and bid everyone a good night.That night, you laid awake thinking about the conversation with Bucky thinking that he probably just said that to make you feel better.But then you noticed little gestures here and there, and you realized this couldn’t be a coincidence. Too often he would come up close behind you and grab whatever it was you wanted from the top shelf before winking at you and leaving. Then there was that one time during a mission where he decided it was a good idea to shield you with his body when a bomb went off and dared to pretend it was nothing.And you absolutely had it when he swung you over his shoulder after almost punching one of the agents in the face when he decided it was fine to joke about your height as well. You kept on hitting Bucky’s back until he put you down, pushing him away from you and yelling at him because of how you looked in front of all your subordinates. He tried to apologize but you were too angry to listen to him, walking away before you gave anything away. The truth was, you were kind of turned on by how quick he was, not even breaking a sweat as he bent down and grabbed your legs.You loved the fact that he was a whole foot taller than you and you hated how distracting he was.Ever since that misunderstanding, Bucky had laid off the flirting and witty comebacks, not even bothering to apologize again. And then Steve put you on a mission together: babysitting Clint’s kids. Bucky tried to get out of it, but Clint told him Cooper wanted to write his history paper on life in army bases during the world war and Bucky practically jumped at the chance. You thought he’d refuse after all the traumatic experiences but then you figured he probably just wanted to talk about the old times with someone who actually found this stuff interesting.As soon as they got to your apartment, Nathaniel ran to Bucky and started playing with his metal arm. You took him away after a while so Bucky could get to work with Cooper, already asking him about all the toys he brought while Lila picked the movie and asked you what you wanted for take-out. You kept on stealing glances at them every once in a while, smiling when you saw the way Cooper’s face lit up at every detail Bucky managed to give him. You laughed when he made a disgusted face when he recalled what the food tasted like.It was two hours later when they both came and sat next to you, and no sooner than that did Cooper and Lila argue about the choice of movies. You hated getting involved in their normal banter but it got too loud too quickly. You threw a pillow at Cooper and told him he chose movies last time and you ended up watching horror for nine hours straight. When
