Chapter 1





Chapter Text

"Thank you for purchasing a StarkTech Companion 'Bot! Please state your name for licensing."
"Uh, Bucky. I mean James! James Buchanan Barnes. Fuck."
"Don't worry, James. Do you prefer to go by Bucky?"
"Yeah. Yes. God, this is weird."
"Would you rather license via your home computer? I can interface with her if it makes you more comfortable."
"No, this is fine. I, uh. I don't think it'll help much."
"Alright then! Let's get started. Do you have an email account we can send notifications to?"
”jbbarnes25@pinmail.com.” 
"Okay, that's now your StarkTech account name. Please enter a password so you can access your account."
"I don't really want an account."
Are you sure? It will give you quicker access to system updates."
"Trust me, I won't miss it."
"Not a problem, you can set up your account at any time if you change your mind. Let's start customizing! What do you want to call me?"
"Call... you?"
"What name do you want me to have?"
"Wh—don't you already have a name?"
"Manufacturer specs list me as Mark VII Companion 'Bot, Model 56 Andro-variant, serial number PX5532AR904445. But that's a mouthful for conversation. Most people like to give their 'bots personal names."
"Oh. Can—can I get back to you on that?"
"Of course. Let's look at your preferences. What eye color would you like me to have?"
"For fuck's sake. Blue, I guess."
"That's a good choice. And hair?"
"What've you got now?"
"At the moment, nothing. I will grow what you indicate in your preferences."
"Just—go to default, okay? I really don't care."
"Do you want default on all settings? You selected a caucasoid variant; unless you specify otherwise, the default settings will match those of the catalogue listing."
"What are those?"
"Brown eyes, brown hair, medium-light skin tone—"
"Okay, okay! Um. Let me think for a minute."
"Not a problem. Let me know when you're ready."
..."Do... you have any preferences?"
"No. I am programmed to accept whatever you indicate."
"That's... okay. That's weird. Can you pick it yourself?"
"That's within my parameters, although most people prefer to choose for themselves."
"Do that, then. You pick it."
"Do you wish to retain blue eyes?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Alright, physical characteristics will activate when I'm restarted. On to the personality submenu. What characteristics would you prefer?"
"Um. Quiet?"
"Okay. Anything else?"
"Honest, I guess. There was this guy in my unit, couldn't ever tell when he was pulling your leg or not. Drove me up the wall."
"I can be honest for you. Do you want me to be honest all the time, or are white lies acceptable?"
"Holy shit, I don't care. Use your own judgment. Everyone else does."
"But honesty is preferable?"
"Yeah. Why the twenty questions?"
"Personality is a complex construct. I need to take an accurate survey of your wants and needs in order to build the 'bot that's right for you. Don't worry about contradictions; most people are contradictory, too. It increases my verisimilitude."
"Oh. Guess that makes sense."
"Are there any other qualities you would like me to have?"
"Uh, let me think for a minute."..."There was... okay, if you ever mention this again I'll take you down to spare parts, but. There was this girl in my fourth grade class, she... she always stuck up for the little guy. I mean, I was usually the one throwing wood chips, but she'd get right up in my face and yell me down. Gave these big lectures on being nice. God, she was eight and had a better moral compass than most adults."
"That's really great."
"You're tellin' me. God, I loved her. Didn't know what the hell to make of it, back then; called her names, hung around like a pest. She must've hated my guts."
"I'm sure she didn't, Bucky. What's wrong?"
"Nothing! Just, uh. That was the first time you've said my name."
"I'm sorry I startled you."
"No, uh. No problem. Um. If you could do that? Be like that girl, I mean. Be a good person. Stand up for the little guy, and don't take shit from anyone. 'Specially not me."
"If you like."
"Okay."
"Anything else?"
"Shit, I don't know. You don't like beets."
"I don't eat organic food, but I can code a subroutine to dislike beets."
"Nah, never mind. Just... make up the rest, I guess."
"Are you sure you don't want to specify my personality further?"
"Yeah. I'm good."
"Alright, the next menu is sexual preferences."
"What the—are you serious?!"
"Did you not wish to order a sex-capable 'bot?"
"No... no, I did. I just. Didn't expect... this. Now."
"If you like I can switch off sexual function until you specify otherwise."
"Um. Do you... I mean, is it good? For you?"
"Do I enjoy sex?"
"Yeah."
"I experience positive feedback loops from satisfying your wants. I simulate orgasm. It is not the same as organic response, though there is a cessation of higher functions, along with positive association in my CPU. I enjoy sex, because I am programmed to."
"Oh."
"You are blushing. Would you prefer to skip this step?"
"No. God. I'm—I'm just embarrassed, okay? Jesus fucking wept.
