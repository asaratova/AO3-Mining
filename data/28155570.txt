Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
The ‘o’ gene has become nearly extinct with the rise of industrialization. First named in ancient Greece, the ‘o’ gene distinguished the most vulnerable of society the omega. With the rise of ‘civilized’ culture, a model that excluded omegas, packs have become non-existent. The nuclear family model led to people not forming packs, instead monogamous families. 	Things worked out fine- for betas. Making up 50% of the population originally, after the second world war it skyrocketed to 70%. Mainly because in beta/beta or beta/omega pairings, only betas are born. In beta/alpha pairings betas are 80% more likely to be born. With the monogamous nuclear model, beta’s gave birth to betas, and they quite literally took over. 	This led to the world governments frantically scrambling to save the genders they threw aside in favor of civilization. It took the near extinction of omegas to get them to realize why they’re so important. Omegas are the most fertile gender, they secrete pheromones that calm their alpha and beta counterparts, and they can be commodified. 	Government Sanctioned Pack Planning. Something the government glamorized to give appeal to the rich and the famous. It worked, it led to the lucrative business to create packs that led to world governments becoming rich. 	Peter thought it was a lot of bullshit. All of the movements to ensure the rights of human beings in the last 100 years crumble to surrender an entire gender ‘for their own good.’ Peter’s parents were an alpha/omega pairing that gave birth to him, an omega, then promptly died in a plane crash. Leaving him to his beta aunt and alpha uncle. 	Considering the Omega Protection Act of 2013, ten years after the beginning of this bullshit. All underage omega’s must have an alpha guardian that lives in the same household. If not they’re surrendered to a foster system that works it butt off to marry them off at 16. This was great for Peter who had an alpha uncle who served as his guardian. 	It wasn’t great when his Uncle got shot in an alleyway and died. He hid his status from government records by having his best friend Ned hack in and mark him as having an alpha guardian. Fairly simple, easy, and he’d be home free once he turned 18, if stupid legislators didn’t make things worse. 	He wasn’t home free. The toll free hotline led to an ‘anonymous’ caller reporting the oversite. Right before academic decathlon nationals. With one Eugene Thompson desperately trying to move past first swing, and get on the team. Yeah… anonymous. This led to a Peter Parker being grabbed in the middle of the night. Luckily for him he had a secret weapon- he was Spiderman. 	When government agents attempted to snatch him, Peter quite literally jumped out the window and swung away. Score one for Peter. Problem is now the government knows he’s enhanced- shit. 	Peter lived on the streets for about a year. He became the opposite of what Spiderman should’ve been. He stole from a penthouse enough money to illegally buy suppressants to make him smell like a beta, and got a job at a warehouse. His days consisted of working at the warehouse, sleeping on the streets, and dealing with the sickly side effects of these suppressants. 	His seventeenth birthday was a celebration. One more year of hiding, and taking the damn suppressants, and sleeping in a box. Three days later an update to the Omega Protection Act, all omegas needed an alpha guardian. News that Peter met with an upset that led to him going into distress in the alleyway. News that led to the government agents finally caught up to him, this time prepared for an enhanced individual.
