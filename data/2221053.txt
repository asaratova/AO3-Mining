Chapter 1: Timcampy
    




Chapter Text
TimcampyThe soft beginnings of dawn float into the room of a white-haired exorcist while said boy sleeps soundly. His golem, Timcampy stares down at his master. After a moment, it flies down to nuzzle the teen awake, and when Allen's eyes open, he scrambles into the white head's top.Immediately, Allen jerks up and grabs his golem's tail just as the yellow being latches onto his right nipple. Before Tim can start sucking, he pulls him out to dangle in front of his face. "Not right now, Tim. Not today at all. I have a mission tonight." With that, Allen gets up, leaving a silently seething golem behind.Allen closes the bathroom door to keep Tim out during his shower; he knows that his faithful companion will follow if he lets him. The shower's turned on, and the boy steps inside, sighing as the water soothes his sore muscles. Sometimes, like now, he wishes that his little golem had hands so Timcampy could give him a massage; the Lord knows that the critter would do anything to make him happy, including molesting him whenever it gets the chance.The exorcist rummages around for his shampoo, never noticing the sound of the door being opened and reclosed by a very skilled tail or Tim fluttering in to hide behind the replaced bottle. But the little being doesn't attack him just yet, he waits until all of the bubbles have gone away, and Allen turns back to grab the soap. He jumps back, hitting the bath's wall when the little ball with wings leaps right at him. "T-timcampy!" Allen slips down the wall, fighting to get away from the ball. "I said not now!"Timcampy doesn't listen; instead, he flies down till he's level with the exorcist's dick and lunges forward. Allen gasps at that wet warmth that shouldn't exist, and his head falls backwards in his pleasure. "N-no, Tim! I c-can't! Y-you perv-ert!" In retaliation for the insult, the golem sucks harder, drawing a pleasured moan from his master. "Ahh hahâ€¦" Allen pants, face becoming beet red.He relaxes slowly, until Timcampy's tail trails down, running over his balls before coming to a stop at his entrance. "No!" he shrieks. "Tim, please don't!" He needn't worry though: Tim never just enters him with his tail; it's full body or nothing." Tim only teases the tender flesh, rubbing his tail across it before coming back to his balls.That tail encircles his testicles and rubs lightly, bringing the white haired boy even closer to his release. With one last harsh suck, Allen cries out and releases into Tim's mouth. He looks at the little beast through half-lidded eyes and pants, "I told you no." In apology, he picks up the soap that his master dropped and silently offers to wash him. "No way in hell! You'll do something perverted again. I don't care if you watch me, but if you touch me again, I'm leaving you in Komui's care!"Allen turns away, missing the lecherous grin completely.Allen's walking alone in the garden when Timcampy decides that he wants a kiss. Allen's knocked down to the ground and his golem's fluttering above him. "T-tim, what're you doing?" In answer, it nuzzles his cheek affectionately before pressing its face against his soft petal lips. Then it promptly flutters upwards, leaving Allen lying bewildered on the ground. "What's with you today?"The next time Tim decides he needs some love is during lunch. He nuzzles up to Allen's cheek in mid chew. "T-timcampy?"On the train, Allen's looking out of the window, doing his best to ignore Kanda who's evil powers of glowering are taking over the cabin. "What's your problem today, BaKanda?""You, as usual, Moyashi.""Then just leave the compartment. I'd prefer it.""I think I will, baka Moyahshi.""It's Allen!""No, I believe it's Moyashi.""Bastard!""Shut up, and go away!""You go away! I hope you stop breathing!""I hope your golem eats you!""Fuck you, Kanda!""Die, Moyashi!" That's when Timcampy decides to appear, getting right in Kanda's face and making him back up. "What the hell?! You stupid creature!" The samurai exorcist promptly slams his fist into Tim's body and sends him flying into the wall. Then he turns around, and with one last growl at the whitette, he leaves."Tim!" Allen cries and picks up his golem. "Are you all right?" It nods before nuzzling into his hand. "I'm so glad. I don't like it when he hurts you." Timcampy flies out of his hands and lands in his lap, making the human freeze. "No Tim!" But despite his actions that morning, he makes no move to molest Allen. Slowly, Allen relaxes, almost falling asleep in the sweet quiet and peace; this is just what the golden being wants.It begins the waltz up to his zipper, pretending to just be adjusting, and when Allen still seems to suspect nothing, it unbuttons his pants, moving quickly inside of them. "No!" Allen shrieks, thrashing around and trying to get his pants down to get his little pervert out of them. "Please!" he cries, falling down onto the ground when he trips over his own feet.Tim merely latches onto his limp me
