Chapter Text
Mineta's attempt to sleaze his way into a kiss on Christmas day had backfired spectacularly, at least for him.Momo had noticed the mistletoe he'd planted all over the dorms and worked to take them all down while her friends were getting ready for the party. Izuku, the first one to be ready aside from her, offered his help in removing the many sprigs. By happenstance they wound up under the same mistletoe at the same time. Momo could have brushed it off, but she decided to honor the Christmas tradition by giving Midoriya a simple, friendly kiss on the cheek. But he'd had the same idea and leaned in at the same time, and instead his lips touched hers in a far more direct kiss.She hadn't been able to get that kiss out of her mind all throughout the party, and though she knew it had been an accident she couldn't help wanting more. When Midoriya knocked on her door that night after the party so they could talk about what had happened and move past the awkwardness, her eyes kept drifting to his lips and wishing they would touch hers again.It was another completely unintentional coincidence that Momo had put a sprig of mistletoe up in her room and that as she stepped back and Midoriya stepped forward they both met underneath it, but the kiss that followed this time was anything but accidental. Momo sighed into his mouth, wrapped her arms around his neck and stepped closer to deepen the kiss.Izuku soon moved her out from underneath the mistletoe, but that was just the beginning of the kissing. It was hard to keep their lips together as they helped each other undress but they did their best, and as soon as her panties and his All Might boxers were sitting on the floor of her bedroom Momo put her weight into the kiss and maneuvered him back until they reached her bed.Momo went down on her back, wrapped her legs around Izuku's waist and welcomed him in as he slid his dick inside of her. She moaned, but it was soon muffled by his lips returning to hers. The kissing resumed, but it had a different flavor to it now. Kissing Izuku before had been an interesting exploration, but kissing him and being kissed by him as he moved his hips and slid his cock back and forth inside of her was an expression of pure and unbridled passion.She moaned as she felt Izuku's large dick pumping into her, and at his hands squeezing her big breasts while he made love to her on her bed. The kiss continued throughout it all. Their lips only separated for the briefest of moments while they caught their breath, and they always went straight back to it after just a few seconds. Even when they hit mutual orgasm they shared their pleasure by moaning and kissing more passionately than ever.Mineta's plan to steal a kiss under the mistletoe had worked out wonderfully. Just not for him.
