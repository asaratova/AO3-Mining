  Look, Tony’s been through a lot.Attempted murder, kidnapping, and torture, to start.He’s endured an extensive surgery he was not only awake for on the table but had to be MacGyvered because he was being held hostage by terrorists. Not to mention having to build a suit out of junk to fight his way out, and then not only finding out his pseudo-father was the douchebag that orchestrated the whole thing, but was also the one responsible for the shady arms deals going on under Tony’s name.And that was just his first few months before the superhero business.At this stage, it isn’t so much a year of similar calamities that Tony looks back on and thinks Another year: older, wiser and alive, as much as it is a continuous cycle of bullshit wherein he looks to the heavens and thinks that wormhole looks damn good right now.Tony's survived the might of the United States Government, the global media, the Hulk on a tantrum, an alien invasion, the loss of his first-born, the accidental creation of his own murderous robot child, and getting double-teamed by a pair of Super Soldiers after witnessing one of them murder his parents.Suffice to say, the fact that he isn’t dead yet is hugely baffling to him.He’s old. He’s got a heart condition. His sternum’s been crushed a million different ways and there’s an arc reactor in there too which is fucking wonderful because breathing properly is for sissies.And yeah, he’s a recovering alcoholic, but that liver damage’s been done.Rhodey’s joked that Tony’s still alive on pure spite.Almost ten years of superhero-ing later, and Tony’s starting to think his platypus might’ve been onto something because the only thing that’s keeping Tony going right now – between the multiple machines he’s hooked up to – is retribution.“You know,” Pepper says almost conversationally, “the best revenge is living well.”“I don’t want revenge, I want justice.”She hums, scanning the SI paperwork that she brought into his hospital suite to distract him with the responsibilities he still has left that include the shitstorm he’s found himself recovering from, and the guilt that Rhodey’s not storming into his room to yell at him because Rhodey can’t walk anymore.“Getting Barnes will be easy enough,” Pepper muses, “Thanks to Project Insight, the whole world knows about the Winter Soldier now. God knows how many atrocities he’s responsible for.”“I don’t want Barnes.” She lifts her brows at him. “He’s a pawn to the whole thing,” Tony continues with some bitterness. If only it had been Barnes, if only it had been that easy. “He was a weapon that Hydra used, none of it was ever a conscious choice on his part.”“Then who do you want, Tony?”“The Rogues.”If Pepper is surprised, she doesn't show it and only asks, “What do you want to do?"He hums, tone deceptively light, “Move on.” Looking straight ahead, he recites the part of the plan that had taken form in his mind, between one surgery and the next, one nightmare and another, “Focus on the Accords, spread some goodwill, ensure reparations are made worldwide, and live up to the Stark Industries slogan: ‘changing the world for a better future’.”With nary a blink or a question of his motives, a speech to dissuade him, Pepper asks, “How can I help?”A corner of his lips lifts. “By doing what you do best. Anyone that gets in the way who doesn’t offer a compromise or an alternative solution, I want them crushed. I’ve wasted enough time entertaining other people’s shit. They want the futurist, they’ll have him.”“And the Rogues?”Their accusations felt branded into his brain, swallowing up the bad code that had made up his parents’ car accident all those years ago. They never believed in him, never wanted him as part of the team, never saw him as anything more than a cash cow to bleed dry. Someone to make endless demands of while constantly taking everything he had to give, all while reminding him how they found his contributions lacking, his presence irritating, his entire existence barely tolerable.Naively, he kept making excuses for their treatment of him, kept hoping that their carelessness of him had simply been the way their friendship operated.But he couldn't quite brush off the barbs about where his wealth came from though they’d been happy enough to spend his money. How his superhero-status was only the result of the suit or how his complicated relationship with his father and Obie was simply a ‘poor little rich boy’ spiel. Or, the way they’d dogpile on the mistakes he made, no matter how hard he tried to atone and fix and be better, only to come to the horrible conclusion that none of it was ever going to be enough.Tony had given them everything he could give.Even if they never quite understood how much of his soul went into the tech they used and abused, how much attention he paid into ensuring their comfort and happiness and how much of his heart he’d put on the line by inviting them into his home; Tony allowed himself to care about them and in their own way,

I don't know if this is salt or bitterness
