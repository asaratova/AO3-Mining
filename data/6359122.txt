Chapter Text
"Harry? Ron? Are you here?""Yeah, in here, Hermione."The two boys exchanged a grin and then sat back and waited for what was certain to be an entertaining reaction."Hi! I just got… what on earth?!"The boys sniggered and lifted themselves slightly from their lazy recline on their hammocks to look at the stupefied girl standing in the doorway."We finally got our dream office set up.  Like it?""It looks like a set piece from Gilligan's Island!""Who?""It's not important.  This is supposed to be an office!""Yup.""A cool office.""I think eet iz very nice.  Eet reminds me of 'ome." Fleur opined. "My family and I used to spend weeks at ze beach every summer when we could manage eet."  She and Tom were there as well, seated in throne-like bamboo chairs."But…"  Hermione got distracted when a trio of bikini-clad women passed by the "window"  which appeared to look out onto a beach and a rolling ocean.  They stopped briefly to peek in the window, giggled and each threw a kiss before moving on.  Hermione's eyebrow twitched in irritation."Blame that on Sirius.  He's the one that designed the place.  They show up every so often." Tom laughed."I'm sure you protested very hard." she huffed.Ron and Harry exchanged a glance and then just looked at her."We didn't ask him to put it in, but we're hardly going to complain about it after.""Yeah, really."Hermione crossed her arms and looked around in irritation.  The whole office looked like they were in the middle of a grass and bamboo hut, complete with hammocks. There were worktables and cabinets, bookshelves, desks--three of them, oddly enough--all of which looked to be made of grass and bamboo.    There were fake windows on all four walls that looked out onto the beach and ocean, as though they sat smack dab in the center of a very small island.   There was even a faint smell of pineapple and coconut in the air, though this proved to be due to the tropical drinks they were all happily consuming.  They'd even dressed to fit their surroundings; the boys were clad in loose knee-length shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, Fleur was in a tropical print sarong with a flower in her hair.  She and Tom were both nicely golden from their time in France.Harry summoned another throne-like woven chair for her to sit in and Ron provided her with a drink in a coconut shell with a little umbrella in it.  Still feeling unaccountably irritated by the whimsy present--headquarters of a space program shouldn't look like a tropical hideaway, damn it!  She resigned herself to just going with it; It was still less fanciful than the office in the clouds the Enchanters group had come up with. "So? How'd things go with Viktor and all your parents?"Hermione sighed.  "Well…all things considered, not too bad.  My parents are…not thrilled…but they've taken things much more calmly than I expected…sort of. I think the fact that he's going to be off playing quidditch while I'm going to be here, that I haven't dropped out of school and I'm not pregnant helped a lot.  I think they're hoping it's just a phase and will go away.   I don't think they're really buying 'we're going to get married because magic says so' as a good reason.""Other than all that, how'd things go?""They went well, I think.  Mum seemed to like Viktor… maybe too much.  She raised her eyebrows and then grinned at me when she first caught sight of him.   So embarrassing.  I was just like geez, mum, down girl!"Fleur just laughed and shared a grin of her own with Hermione.  Harry and Ron grimaced."Okay, wow.  TMI.""How do you think I feel?""How were Viktor's parents?""Oddly enough, having my parents sitting there being sort of stiff and disapproving seems to have warmed them up to me somewhat.""That's…good?""I guess.  What's been going on around here?""Well, Nott and Malfoy realized they needed to let their dads in on things before the rest of the parents…" Tom offered."Why… oh.  They're part of the company.  It would look pretty strange if they had no idea.""Not to mention they'd be mad at being made to look dumb in front of the other parents.""Susan's aunt is one of the investors.  She got a crash course too.  So, we've had the three of them wandering around here all week, looking sort of shell-shocked.  It was pretty funny, actually." Ron laughed.  "Beyond that, we've mostly just been checking over everything to make sure the launch goes off without a hitch, and getting our presentations ready.""We've gotten several visits from Unspeakables too.""Unspeakables? What did they want?""Well…it seems they were aware of what we were doing, but they couldn't offer any help because of the secrecy contracts they were under.  Loki destroyed whatever was holding those in place when he destroyed the goblet of fire.  Don't spread that around.  They don't want folks bugging them all the time.""Okaay.""Essentially, they asked to be part of our presentation to the ICW.  They said it might not be quite as hard to move everyon
