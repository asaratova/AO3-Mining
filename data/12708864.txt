Chapter 1: The opening
    




Chapter Text

"My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. And I made a terrible mistake. I reset the timeline and the people I love have suffered for it. Especially my two best friends. But that is where our story begins."
Star LabsNight"Cisco, you're my best friend man. So...are we gonna be okay?" Barry asked almost hesitantly.Barry had never regretted anything in his life more than he regretted Flashpoint. If he had known then what his actions would cost Cisco and Caitlin, he would never have saved his mother. But he couldn't take it back, only deal with the consequences. Which he was doing right now, Barry mused as Cisco turned around in his chair, an unreadable look on his normally cheerful face."Do you want the truth?" Cisco asked stoically."Yeah." Barry said but had a feeling he wasn't going to like the answer."I don't know." Cisco admitted.It wasn't the answer Barry had wanted but he knew that it was foolish to expect less. So Barry simply nodded before turning and walking out.Barry put on his suit and speed out, needing to go for a run. He ran to escape it all. The guilt over Flashpoint, his anger over being forced to quit CSI, his guilt over Caitlin and his despair over the loss of his friendship with Cisco. He ran and ran and ran, faster then he had ever run before. He didn't think, he didn't feel, he just lost himself to the feel of the speed. Then the blue portal opened up in front of him.Barry couldn't stop and ran through it. He sped out and tried to stop, skidding to a halt as best he could. It was at that point that Barry saw the army of metal men and the group of people fighting them."Where the hell am I?" Barry wondered to himself.Barry saw a green monster running through the streets, roaring as it fought the metal men, a man firing an arrow at them as well. But it was the girl dressed in red, cowering among the fleeing civilians that had Barry`s attention. Her hands seemed to be glowing with red energy and the look on her face. It was the same look Barry got when he thought of Flashpoint. Guilt, self loathing, and fear.He saw some of the metal men aim their weapons at the girl and instinct took over. He sped over, grabbed her and sped them away. As the metal men fired at them, Barry and the girl were sent crashing through a window, landing painfully on the floor."You alright?" Barry asked as he pulled himself to his knees.This is all our fault." She said, eyes wide with terror and guilt."Yeah, I blame myself for things to," Barry said and she looked up at him for the first time, "I don't know what's going on here, I don't know who you are, I don't even know where I am. What I do know is that we are under attack by an army of robots. And I'm freaking out, but I am going back out there to fight because that is my job. You can stay here and hide, or you can come out there with me to make things right. Your choice."His piece said, Barry stood up and sped out, ready to face this army of robots.
