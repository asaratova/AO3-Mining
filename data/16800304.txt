1943
When Howard Stark saw it in the preliminary scans of Steve’s blood, he wasn’t sure what to make of it. Steve himself, was on the bond circuit. It seemed a waste to Howard, putting a super-soldier on a stage to sell war bonds, but it wasn’t in his control. Besides, Phillips was an experienced soldier. He must have his reasons for allowing it.Unsure of what he was seeing, Howard called one of his co-workers to take a look – a TECHNIT engineer called Theo. The other man frowned. ‘I’m no doctor, but I got a feeling that’s wrong.’So did Howard – a gut feeling that was screaming at him.The two of them took the blood down to medical. They told the first doctor who was free that they both felt there was something off about the blood. The doc quickly put some of the blood on a slide and slid it under the microscope. He studied it for a moment and then he frowned before he looked up.‘I think you’re right,’ he said. ‘There’s definitely something wrong. I’ll get a team and we’ll take a closer look.’That done, the two men returned to their lab.That was until, the next morning, Phillips called both of them to his office. He was looking over a report of some kind.‘You wanted to see us, Colonel?’ Howard asked, knocking as they walked in.‘Yeah.’ He slid a file across the desk. ‘That’s Rogers’ medical report from when he was trying to enlist, what do you make of it?’Theo, being closest to it, picked it up and opened it. He flicked through five pages. ‘You’d think if he was going to be lying about everything else, he’d lie about his name too. Which one is most accurate.’‘The first one. Apparently, the first time he didn’t realise how much his health affected his chances of getting into the army.’Theo flicked back to the first page. ‘Household contact to tuberculosis?’Alarmed, Howard yanked the file out of Theo’s hand and looked himself. What he didn’t realise at the time – what he’d think of later – was that Theo released the file as he grabbed it, as if he’d been expecting it. Sure enough, there it was: Household contact to tuberculosis. What the hell was he doing trying to enlist with that sitting there?Suddenly, Howard became very afraid of what he was about to be told.‘His mom died of it in ’36,’ Phillips said. ‘She was a nurse, so I see no way he didn’t know he was a carrier.’‘Am I right in assuming the serum didn’t cure it, sir?’ Theo asked.‘No. It exacerbated it. All it needs to do is activate and we’ve got an epidemic that’ll put the Spanish Flu to shame.’Theo nodded, looking thoughtful. ‘This man tried to enlist five times despite being repetitively told he was unfit. He’s now got an enhanced body and all his previous illnesses are gone. He will not listen to us telling him that he’s time bomb of contamination.’Sad, but true. ‘And if we keep him in the bond circuit, we risk the TB activating and being unleashed on the civilian population.’ That idea twisted Howard’s stomach.‘Exactly,’ Phillips said. ‘Seeing as you men were the ones who brought it to our attention, I was hoping you might have some bright ideas. As it stands, our best option is to have him disappeared or popped off before that TB activates.’It was clear Phillips didn’t want to do this, but he was thinking of the potential casualties that he needed to avert.Howard wracked his brain for another alternative. Without Erskine, there was no way to know how to make a counteractant. Theo suddenly cleared his throat.‘I may have an idea, but it’s a bit...unconventional.’‘Yes?’ Phillips asked.***The man Theo brought to the conference room was tall and middle aged with greying dark hair and brown eyes.‘Dr. Jasper Mortimer,’ he presented him as.Theo had been very tight-lipped on how Mortimer could help, but he was confident he would once the situation had been explained to him. Phillips had agreed upon looking over Mortimer’s professional history. Some doctors would occasionally slip and say things they weren’t supposed to. Not only was Mortimer a top-of-the-line medical practitioner and surgeon, but he had made none of these indiscretions.So, the situation was explained to Mortimer. He was handed the data and he read through them, occasionally pushing his glasses back up his nose and asking for extra details.
When the debrief was done, Mortimer sat back in his chair.‘Very well,’ he said, ‘but my methods do not go beyond these four walls.’‘Is that your only condition?’ Phillips asked.‘It is.’‘Then you have a deal.’‘Excellent.’ Dr. Mortimer stood. ‘As Theo said, my methods are unconventional. It would, perhaps, be better to show you rather than tell you.’As he said this, Theo carefully pulled a box out of his jacket pocket. Then, of all things, he produced an egg from the box and set it on the table in front of Mortimer. The doctor held his hand over it. For a second nothing seemed to happen. Then the egg hatched. The shell cracked and a tiny chick made its way out.Not so strange in of itself.What happened next was though.The chick grew. It got bigger
