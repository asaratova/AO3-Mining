Chapter Text
Clint whimpered, shoving the rubber dildo deeper inside him, panting in an attempt to get relief. He moaned throatily when it lodged deep inside, twisting it around before pulling it out and shoving it back in. It didn’t take much more for him to be panting as he came, clutching the sheets in release. His ass clenched around the dildo before he pulled it out and tossed it aside, sighing. “You know, this isn’t going to last forever.” Clint sighed and turned his head to find Natasha, looking sternly at him. “Will you please stop watching when I’m masturbating?” She smirked as she kicked the dildo out of the way. “I’m never one to miss a show. But the point is, this isn’t going to last forever. I don’t understand why you can’t just tell the others. I’m sure they’ll be more than willing to volunteer.” Clint groaned and flopped back onto his sheets. He needed a shower. A long, hot shower. “Listen, I can’t just tell them I’m a succubus. What’s the first thing that used to come to your mind when you thought of one?” “A female devil fucking the life out of men.” “Exactly.” Clint sighed, rubbing his face. “How do I even explain to them that no, we aren’t really devils, no, we’re not all female, and no, I don’t have to kill you.” Natasha gave him a look. “Just like that. They don’t need an explanation, Clint. I’m sure Tony will get to researching once you tell them, anyway.” She bent over the bed and picked the dildo up gingerly and wiped it on the soiled sheets. “Aren’t you getting hungry?” Clint sighed and buried his face. “Fuck, I’m starving.” -- Clint sort of felt horrible about being a hungry succubus, because it meant his hormones were driving any man near him horny. “Barton.” Phil barked at him when he’d been summoned to his office. “Go find a one-night stand.” Clint did, mostly because if Phil Coulson was getting bothered by his hormones, he was probably driving everyone else nuts. The kid he found was just that – a kid. He was over 21, with a real ID, but young enough for Clint to keep riding throughout the night. “Fuck, man.” The kid groaned, thrusting deep into him from under. “Fuck, you feel good.” “Never had someone like me, huh?” Clint whispered, grinding his hips and squeezing down. The kid was drunk enough to not worry about a condom, and Clint couldn’t exactly catch STDs anyway. He moaned in sheer pleasure when thick ribbons of semen shot into him and he shuddered, angling his hips so he could move them up and down the cock faster. It was well past 5 by the time Clint felt full enough – the kid had managed to last, which was pretty impressive, really. Clint sighed as he pulled the limp cock out of him. “Thanks, kid,” he told the sleeping kid. “Don’t worry about the bill. Not that you can hear me.” His way back to the Tower was quick, and he stretched out like a cat on his bed, feeling satiated for the first time in months. “You look like a cat full of milk.” “I’d cringe at the pun, but I know you don’t do puns.” He replied, grinning. “Man, I feel so good.” Natasha grinned back at him, sitting on the edge of his bed. “Hopefully he doesn’t come looking for me like the last one did because the sex was so amazing.” Natasha rolled her eyes. “They all looked for you afterwards because the sex was so amazing. It’s not like you can’t avoid them.” “Yeah, but it’s fucking annoying.” Clint hugged his pillow. “I’m gonna go to sleep, yeah?” -- It was months of ignoring hunger jabs again when Tony jabbed a finger at him one day. “It’s you.” Clint blinked at him, looking up from his cereal. “You’re making me horny.” “I’m making you horny?” Clint repeated. “What?” Tony groaned and comically banged his forehead against the table. “Okay, listen. Lately I’ve been thinking about nothing but bending you over whatever surface you’re on and fucking you silly.” “Strange.” Thor spoke up from his place on the couch. “I have had this exact dilemma, as well.” “See!” Tony said, jabbing his finger now in Thor’s direction. “You must be doing something. What is it?” He ran a frustrated hand through his hair and glanced at Bruce and Steve. “Please tell me you two are experiencing the same thing. You’re like, drugging us or something. I don’t think you’d do it voluntarily, so either Coulson or Fury or Hill has you sprayed with something that you don’t know.” Clint tried to look at Natasha for help, but she was grinning like the Cheshire Cat from where she was sitting. Great, he thought. When Tony turned back to him, Clint slid all the way back on his chair. “I’m not drugging you.” He grumbled. “Not on purpose, anyway.” Steve blinked. “So you are?” “I… It..” Clint rubbed his forehead. “This is going to sound really weird, but let me get it all out before you start panicking, okay?” He was met with four sets of confused eyes and one amused one, and he took a deep breath. “I’m, uh. I’m a succubus.” He immediately saw the question coming up from Tony and raised his hand to stop it. “It’s – I mean, suc
