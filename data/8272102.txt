Chapter 1: Though Shall Not Cheat
    




Chapter Text
The Avengers Initiative began with everything happening almost exactly as in the first Avengers movie. But in this story Tony had cleaned up his act after Afghanistan. He stuck to Phil's script that Iron Man was a body guard. When he and Steve met they still didn't like each other until after the battle of New York and they fell in love. With his reputation being good, speculation began about how Tony and Iron man acted the same. Tony decided it was best to admit to being Iron Man. Steve kept his persona as Captain America hidden and became known as Steve Rogers the artist. With the rest of the Avengers hiding their identity's they went on various missions and mostly succeeded even though they left a lot of damage behind. Eventually Sokovia happened and Wanda messed with Tony's mind resulting in the creation of Ultron. With everyone blaming Tony, he went further to try and make amends. He found ways to minimize the damage done by villains and the Avengers in a fight.  He created force field Shields that were used not only to save lives but protect property. This worked out successfully and the world loved them. He shared the technology with fellow Super Heroes resulting in various alliances. Trying to learn from the mistakes made in Sokovia, Tony befriended some of his team mates and taught himself to communicate better. He went to therapy, worked through his ptsd and fears. He learned to love himself and accept that he was also worthy to be loved. He became very close to Natasha, Thor, Vision and Bruce. While he continued to strengthen his friendship with Rhodey and Pepper. His love life flourished with him and Steve setting boundaries so that their Avengers side would not impact on their life together. With this closeness working as a team became easier. They eventually found out that Phil was still alive and that Fury had lied to them. With Tony still snooping through Shield's network he stumbled upon the existence of Hydra within Shield. With the help of the heroes he'd formed alliances with, they exposed Hydra without the fall of Shield. Unfortunately this did not stop the assassination attempt on Nick Fury's life.He disappeared and left almost everyone to believe he had died. With Nick gone it was up to Phil to act as interim director of Shield. He changed the way things worked and the first thing he did was to set the Avengers free. Then he changed the Shield leadership to be run by 13 people so that every decision would be decided upon with a vote. The odd numbers was to ensure that there never was a tie vote. After those changes he left to go destroy as many Hydra bases as possible while still being the Avengers liaison. He was still kept up to date on everything that happened at Shield and with Tony's help they were able to keep exposing Hydra agents who tried to infiltrate Shield again.As an added safety measure each new recruit had to go through a lie detector test while injected with a truth serum. What they were not told was that the serum also injected nanobites that would be able to monitor each agent so that should they ever betray Shield they would be caught. Phil didn't like this route but he had no choice. Only he, Tony and Friday new what the truth serum contained.Agents who were already a part of Shield had to go through the process as well. The nanobites were untraceable and this made it impossible for Hydra to figure out how Shield kept catching them out. Since Tony was the one who created the serum and Bruce was the only one allowed to administer it, there was no way for Hydra to figure out what went into the Serum.Any agent injected with the serum was kept isolated for 24 hours after it was administered. They were also required to drink a lot of water to give the illusion that they were flushing the drug out. The next process was to scan and search them before they were thoroughly sterilized before being released making it impossible for Hydra to ever be able to infiltrate Shield ever again.It seemed like things were perfect and of course that was the perfect time for tragedy to strike. A mission that Tony was not a part off went wrong, Wanda using her abilities miscalculated resulting in a loss of innocent lives. It lead to a meeting held by the UN and the Sokovia accords were drawn up. Tony wanted to sign, Steve did not and it lead to an awful argument. Steve reminded Tony that Sokovia was his fault. So Tony used Stark Industries to drum up support for the Avengers. Instead of "Civil War" breaking out.When that did not deter the UN, the Avengers held a press conference announcing that they would not protect the world and would leave it in the hands of the UN. Other Super Heroes who realized that this could affect them as well, announced that if the Avengers pulled back so would they.... With Superheroes pulling back from fighting crime, the world went through hell. In just 1 week the crime rate world wide went up by 80%, terr
