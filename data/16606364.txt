Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter’s been in a couple of Avenger battles since they saved the world. He was in the one to save the world, to get rid of Thanos for good. Peter was there with all of them, the lost and the ones who searched for them, who had to live without them, who were that much more motivated now that they were back. He was in that battle, though he can barely remember it, because his heart rang in his ears and his eyes were trained on Tony. Peter worried, during that battle, that something was going to happen, that Tony would find a way to sacrifice himself to end the threat, and that fear snuck under his skin and settled there, tainting every move he made. He already felt weird, displaced, but he came back from the dead just moments before, so he didn’t blame himself for that. But he only settled down and started on the long road to recovery when the battle was won, and Tony was still alive. He was only able to rest when he got home and May was there, when he was able to text Ned and MJ, when he counted their losses and they were only broken bones and temporary pain. They were okay. Peter was back. His family was safe.There were a few more battles after that, when he was ready to get back into them—the drone things in the Bronx, those weapons dealers in Ohio, of all places, and that weird Octopus guy that tried to blow up the Daily Bugle. And now this one—a group of about twenty terrorists trying to steal some of Tony’s tech. Peter’s felt pretty on his game since he arrived here and started webbing them up, and he always feels really, really cool when he’s fighting alongside Iron Man, Black Widow and Captain America.Somehow, he’s wound up one-on-one with who they assumed is the leader of this gang. Peter is used to the bad guys wearing masks, but this one is different. His face is completely covered with some kind of black shroud, he’s got a hood on, and he’s steeped in darkness no matter where he moves. Peter doesn’t know how he can see, dressed up like that, but despite Peter’s own quickness and alertness, this guy has been able to land almost every punch on him. Which doesn’t negate the blows Peter has landed, but it sorta…makes them less impressive.“You’re not much of a talker, are you?” Peter asks, trying to dodge around him, but he still somehow manages to get clocked across the face. The guy doesn’t respond and usually the dudes Peter faces off with have something to say, and with this silence, he can feel a weird sort of seriousness settling in his bones.“Peter,” Karen says. “You have multiple lacerations, the suit is taking a good deal of damage—”“It’s okay, I’ll heal up,” Peter says. “C’mon, Karen. Don’t go full Tony on me.”“Tony Stark did program me, Peter.”“Yeah, like I could forget,” Peter says.The lights in the warehouse flicker and fade, and the bad guy backs up into the newfound darkness, disappearing completely. Peter thinks he hears the beginning of laughter, something tight and reigned in, like it could be loud and booming, cutting and harsh to anybody it was directed at. It scares him a little bit, but he refuses to show it.Peter turns on his night vision and keeps his guard up. He can’t see him despite having a clear layout of the room, the steel walls and tall ceilings, the random boxes knocked around from their fight. He should be in here. The exit is behind Peter, and he definitely thinks he would have noticed if he rushed past him to leave. He reaches up and touches his com, announcing something he probably should have a couple minutes ago. “Tony, I think I’m fighting the leader of these dudes.”“Kid, where are you?”“Uh,” Peter says, remembering the map they laid out on the kitchen bar, remembering the wet glass ring he accidentally put on the paper. Karen pulls it up on his screens and circles his location, and he silently thanks her. “Back quadrant, eighty-four.”“Got it,” Tony says. “Hold on, coming to you.”Peter breathes hard and keeps scanning the room. “Karen,” he whispers. “Is he still here?”“Yes,” she says. “I am detecting signs of human life in the room other than you, but I can’t place his exact location.”“Great,” Peter mutters. He puffs out his chest a little more, trying not to sound like a kid even though he knows he always sounds like a kid. “Hey, buddy! You should have known better, trying to steal shit from Tony Stark! Nobody steals shit from Tony Stark!”Before he even knows it, a figure is rushing towards him. Peter quickly dodges away, proud of himself, and he turns just in time to knock the dude in the stomach. He grins, internally celebrating, because this has got to be some kind of trained ninja or something, but then the guy disappears again into the darkness. Peter spins around himself, huffing. He shoots a couple webs but they don’t catch anything. He shoots a taser web just in case. Nothing.“Why the hell can’t I see him with the night vision, Karen?” Peter says, trying not to be too loud about his current disadvantage, even though he’s pretty
