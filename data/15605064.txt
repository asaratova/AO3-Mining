Chapter Text

Chapter One:
A bright light from a crater almost blinds Alex Danvers. One of the prime agents of the DEO, it's her job to get to the bottom of the strange and mysterious situations. A mysterious meteor falling from the heavens is one of those things which Alex needs to take a closer look at.She coughs a couple of times and prepares to climb down into the hole. To be honest, Alex's attention is divided. Just a couple days ago, she almost went down in a plane. The person who saved the plane is someone who the press is hyping up as the new savior, the one and only Supergirl. That person also happens to be Alex's younger adopted sister, Kara.Alex is not sure how she feels about this and Kara needlessly risking herself. If Kara gets hurt, then it will be Alex will get the heat and be responsible for her.She deeply takes a couple of breaths and focuses. She'll be perfectly honest, Alex needs the work.The sound of a couple of helicopters pull Alex's attention away from the crater. Several uniformed personel drop down onto the ground. Alex prepares to confront them. A brunette woman walks closer towards them. Alex recognizes her instantly when she steps out of the shadows."Major Lane."Lucy Lane gives the DEO agent a raised eyebrow."Agent Danvers. There's no need for you to be here.""Actually, given that meteor fell from the heavens, I have every reason to be here."Alex roots upon the spot and gives Lucy one of the most stubborn looks imaginable. She takes a deep breath and looks Alex deep in the eye."Fine. You want to take a look at the meteor. Fine.""Of course it's fine. Unless you want to take it up with Director Henshaw. He's the one who wanted me here."Lucy frowns. There's a nagging voice in the back of her head which says that her father would not back down. The military really wanted the meteor given it clipped one of their helicopters on the way down."Look at that!"The shout spins Alex around. Two of the military guards move close to the meteor. Alex steps closer and takes a glimpse at some kind of spores.She works enough missions as part of an organization which deals with alien threats to understand how mysterious spores often lead to a very big problem."Step away! I wouldn't touch those things.""I'm afraid that this isn't under your jurisidiction, Agentâ€¦""You heard the lady!"Lucy snaps and makes the soldiers move back. They know better than to argue with a Lane. Lucy steps closer and turns to address Alex."Do you know what those spores are?""We're going to need to get a sample to find out and we're going to have to clear the area. Civilians are already blocked off, right?"Lucy answers with a nod. She feels an immense heat coming and it takes her a second to realize that the meteor's heating up. She takes in a deep breath and finds the spores shooting into her. She coughs and bends over."You okay?"Lucy coughs a couple more times. She suddenly is more able to breathe the second the feeling of the spores going up her nose fades away."Yeah, I'm fine."The meteor starts to hiss. Lucy throws her hands into the air."Everyone! Hit the deck!"Alex grabs Lucy by the hand and leads her way. The soldiers scatter and the meteor starts to hiss before exploding into the air. The spores clinging onto the meteor rain onto the air. They ooze into the ground. The energy bombarding from the spores goes off of the charts.A ringing sensation hits Alex's head when she staggers back and falls to the ground. Something clings onto her hand and slides up her arm.In a very short instant, Alex's entire body heats up with something becomes one with her. She turns to her hand to catch sight of some kind of black substance oozing up her sleeve and underneath her body. The substance moves around her.A surprised feeling of warmth and pleasure comes from Alex. The object slides between her legs and causes her to almost lose it in front of everyone. An extremely pleasurable feeling just shoots through every inch of her orifices. Alex shudders from it clinging onto her."You okay?"Lucy leans in and puts a hand on Alex's forehead. She feels a blistering warmth coming against the palm of her hand."You're burning up.""Yeah, thanks mother."Lucy shakes her head. Alex gets back to her feet and almost staggers. She falls, hands pressing on the side of Lucy's legs when she almost slides to her knee. Lucy drags her up."I'm serious, you don't look too well.""I'm fine...just a bit dizzy.""We should get you looked out."Lucy worries because the meteor exploded close to Alex. Despite butting heads with her a couple of times in the past, mostly due to Lucy's skeptical feeling that the DEO is really useful to begin with, she does not want anything bad to happen to Alex. Alex clings onto her."Your hair...it's really soft. And it smells really good."Lucy finds herself shocked, and a bit anxious from Alex pressing her face into her hair. Perhaps the spores knocked her loopy, hell Lucy's feeling a little bit light headed. She just has t
