Chapter 1: What Just Happened?
    




Chapter Text
Keeping an eye on Bl√ºdhaven was difficult work, to say the least. But something felt off about it today as he patrolled the city. Last time Dick had this sort of feeling, he was shot in the head by KGBeast, lost his memory, and was used by the worst people imaginable before finding his way back to who he was. He shivered at the mere thought of it all , hoping that he wouldn't be going through it again. The wind flowing through his hair as he moved began to relax him though. He moved to land on the roof of another building, although he looked a little too late and left straight into a portal that had a ring of fire on its edge.He felt himself fall and land pretty quickly with a resounding thud. His blow was only slightly cushioned by the soft carpet beneath him. Still hurt though. So much for trying to avoid additional injuries for a while. He groaned as he stood up, watching the portal close above him.His attention was quickly brought to the sound of frantic shuffling, followed by rapid footsteps heading towards the room he was in. Instinctively, he pulled out his escrima sticks when he saw the movement of another person in the room.Only to see another man in a similar skin-tight suit. A spider adorning the same spot the bird on his chest did. "You're a vigilante, too!?" "You're a superhero, too!?" They said to each other in unison, as they froze in shock.
