It’s a little awkward, Flash thinks, sitting on the bed of the guy who he used to make a point of harassing, especially considering he’s waiting for said guy to get home so they can work on homework. Peter’s room is and isn’t what he imagined it to be. There’s camera stuff, bits and pieces of computers, school books, things Flash expected. On the other hand, there’s the stuff he didn’t expect, newspaper and magazine clippings of Spider-man nearly cover Peter’s entire desk, sketches of Spider-man’s suit are tacked on the wall, and, really, Flash wasn’t aware that Peter was a fan.In the time they’ve started hanging out, Spider-man’s one of those subjects that’s only come up a few times and every time, Peter has been the one to change the subject. It doesn’t bother Flash much, though, he’d rather not discuss the slight obsession he’s formed over the vigilante.Of course, that is when said vigilante comes careening into Peter’s window, making it shudder in the pane. Flash nearly falls off the bed with his shock, sucking in a breath when he notices the red smear that is undoubtedly blood on the glass. He doesn’t even move when Spider-man starts fumbling from the window until he realizes that the vigilante can’t get the window open and it prompts him to step forward, forcing the window up.His timing leaves a little to be desired, because the second the window is up fully, Spider-man seemingly loses consciousness, slumping down and if Flash hadn’t reached out and grabbed hold of the suit, well, Flash is just glad that there’s a roof over the Parker’s front porch.It takes some maneuvering, but he manages to get the unconscious man into the room and onto Peter’s bed before he goes back to the window to shut it once more. And then, he has nothing to stall himself with and finds himself hovering beside the bed, staring down at Spider-man and trying to figure out why he showed up at Peter’s, if he should wait for him to regain consciousness, or if he should go ahead and try to figure out where the blood is coming from, which now that he’s had the thought, it’s sort of obvious by the tear in the suit.Eyebrows furrowed, Flash turns and goes into the bathroom, moving things around until he comes across a first aid kit. When he goes back into the bedroom, Spider-man is stirring some, making these pitiful groans and Flash can only stare as he reaches up and pulls the mask off and he’s left staring at Peter.Peter is prodding at the wound visible through the tear in the suit when the first aid kit slips from Flash’s grip and hits the floor with a muted thud. They end up having a staring contest, Peter breathing heavily, his hair sticking up in several directions and a bruise forming high up on his right cheek. “Flash,” Peter finally croaks out, one hand curling over the wound and the other indicating the first aid kit on the floor by Flash’s feet.Flash starts then, shifting into motion, leaning down to grab the kit before moving to Peter’s side, “What do you need me to do?”Watching Peter struggle to sit up, Flash finds himself moving without thinking about it, sitting on the edge of the bed and helping Peter sit up. “There should be a zipper on the back, in the middle at the top,” Peter states, voice hoarse, and it takes Flash a few tries before he gets his fingers on it, dragging the tongue down and helping Peter roll the top of the suit down off his shoulders and then arms.It’s a little more difficult, trying to ease the material away from the wound but they work slowly and finally get the top part of the suit pooled at Peter’s waist and Flash can see the extent of the damage as well as the other bruises and scrapes that litter Peter’s torso, “Jesus, Parker, are you trying to get yourself killed?” He mutters before he can stop himself, popping open the first aid kit.“Antiseptic wipes,” Peter responds, before grinning a little, “Not the reaction I expected from you,” he adds and grins just a bit more, only to cause his lip to split towards the corner and Flash is nearly hypnotized when Peter’s tongue flicks out to catch the blood that wells up.Flash swallows heavily and turns his attention back to the kit, not bothering to respond as he fishes out the antiseptic wipes, tearing one of the packets out and hating how his hands shake when he pulls one of the wipes out, “You want me to do this or...?”Peter settles back on his elbows and shakes his head, “You’ll be able to do better than me,” he answers, eyebrows furrowed as he focuses down on the wound which is still sluggishly bleeding, “Just be easy, but make sure you get all of it.”Nodding slowly, Flash starts, being as gentle as he knows how, cleaning the wound, mindful of the pained sounds Peter keeps making and the way his body flinches away from him, “Sorry,” he mutters softly while he opens another packet and cleans the last of the wound before turning his gaze back to Peter once more.“There should be gauze and medical tape in there,” Peter tells him, the little
