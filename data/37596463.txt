Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It’s been already a week since the battle with Apocalypse, marking the longest time Peter had spent around mutants. He was leaning against an old oak tree now, crutches at his sides, observing Erik Lehnsherr, sprawled on a bench, and the Professor, in his wheelchair, having a conversation. Must have been something about the mansion, the speedster decided.Nearby, in an ocean of lush green grass, the speedster’s new friends, Ororo, Kurt, Jean and Scott, settled down. Raven and Hank, along with the rest of the teachers, kept an eye on the students scattered around the school grounds.He peered into his father’s features, his disheveled hair and growing beard, which in the light of the sun was glowing red. Although the man looked calm, dark circles under his gray-blue eyes betrayed his insomnia, caused, as Peter guessed, by the horrible memories of his family’s murder. Regardless of the way how Magneto was presented through the media as a terrorist and killer, the young man couldn’t see any of it in the man he was now looking at. Still, he didn’t tell him the truth, didn’t tell him that he is not alone in this world, that beside the family bounded by long friendship and a common feature they all shared, namely mutated genes, he had a family by blood.But just like in the battle with En Sabah Nur, or “the blue dude” as the speedster called him, he didn’t have the courage, Peter, that silver-haired whirlwind who was still in fact a child, didn’t have the courage to look into those blue-gray eyes and confess. It tortured him every moment of being near Erik, but at least he had the opportunity to get to know him better, to learn more about his habits and moods, his relationship with Professor X, Mystique and Beast, the oldest and, perhaps, the only friends that were still alive.What if, by revealing the truth, he scares Erik off, who had never been particularly eager to stay at school? What if he rejects the long-lost family, he didn’t even know he had and probably never wanted? These constant “what ifs” filled the speedster’s mind every time he approached his father with the simple “I need to talk to you”.“How is your leg, boy?” Erik said so suddenly that Peter flinched. “Maybe you’d better sit down? There is enough space for two.”Quickly recovering, the speedster answered lazily, “Nah, I’m all good here. You know, I can’t sit still in one place for long, like for real.”Erik gave him a short nod, his whole expression turning rather indifferent. Peter almost sighed with relief and disappointment tangled in a messy knot.“Is everything alright, Peter?” the Professor asked in his soft all fatherly manner, his penetrating gaze seemed to find its way into your soul, or rather into your mind. Though with Maximoff it was not an easy task, his mind was too fast even for Charles to read properly, and he tried once. Just to find out what was eating the speedster inside, nothing more.The temptation to confess the truth with the telepath beside him was strong, but Peter fought it all the same. It felt wrong to drop such a thing on unsuspecting Erik, as if he were trying to replace his lost daughter, which he clearly didn’t intend to do.  “Don’t worry, prof,” the speedster replied, grinning. “Enjoy the peace while you can.”“Best to heed the advice,” said a girl’s cheerful voice somewhere behind Peter. Painfully familiar voice, for some.Maximoff turned around abruptly to see the girl, whose eyes were fixed on him, she was approaching the young man with a bright smile on her face. She wore a mahogany red leather jacket, a black T-shirt with the AC/DC name on it, black jeans and lace-up boots, that were matching the jacket perfectly.Peter’s jaw almost dropped in surprise, his eyes stung a little. He flew up to the girl as fast as he could, forgetting about his crutches, squeezing her tightly in embrace. She wrapped her arms around his neck, hugging him lovingly, her eyes closed, no hint of a smile left in her features. The two of them stood there clutching at each other as if they didn’t expect to meet again, for a moment, the world around them ceased to exist.Everyone gaped at the scene, unaccustomed to seeing Peter so vulnerable instead of being sarcastic and witty from dawn to dusk and some more. The young mutants even moved closer on their blanket, ready to shamelessly eavesdrop. All of them were wondering at who might this stranger be to Maximoff. Even Charles and Eric swapped a glance, looking perplexed.Pulling back slightly, the girl brushed tenderly Peter’s gray hair from his face, scanning his features. She then stepped back, her hands slid down his shoulders to his elbows, and stared at the heavily painted cast on the speedster’s leg, a line appeared between her brows, something like guilt crossed her features.“I’ve barely been gone and look what happened,” she declared, shaking her head contritely.Her gaze fell from Peter to the floating above the ground crutches at his sides to the mutants behi
