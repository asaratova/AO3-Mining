Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
It was defeat.Humiliating, miserable defeat.And Loki didn't like it.He hadn't liked it earlier when he was slammed about like a child's toy and he hadn't liked it when his own enemy had stared down at him, regret and anger mixed in his electric blue eyes before he placed that muzzle on his face.It wasn't demeaning, the muzzle, in fact Loki wore it with pride.It was a reminder to one and all of how dangerous Loki was; a creature whose words alone were so powerful that they had to be gagged. His magic was contained as well, that he mourned.He felt vulnerable without his power. Thor still had all of his, Loki didn't.So, when Thor had dragged and pushed Loki to the point where they would leave from, Loki had kept his gaze lowered.He was clever and knew when to appear meek and when to strike.He was a snake, waiting for his chance, waiting for the prey to lower its stupid eyes head back to whatever it did before sensing the predator.Then he would strike and rip his fangs into flesh.Thor shoved his brother, not caring that he stumbled. Then wrapped his hand around the too thin bicep and yanked him back.It never occurred to him that he was being the brawny, physically manipulating beast Loki always blamed him of being. He was barely controlling the urge to launch a fist in Loki's face.He met his new friends, smiling when Barton told him that this was actually the second time they'd met."Truly?" Thor said, smiling."Yeah" Barton laughed "You remember tearing through our facility, don't you? Took out our men like they were daisies?""Aye" Thor laughed and reddened "that was not…""It was impressive as hell" Clint laughed.Loki ignored them in favor of staring at the ground.He was not looking forward to going back.There was nothing for him there, nothing at all.He looked up when Thor returned, having said good bye to everyone, and noticed how Thor's smile faded when he looked at Loki.Lips firm, gaze even firmer, Thor extended the Tesseract for Loki to hold.The Trickster hesitated for a second and looked at Thor's eyes.There was no compassion there.So be it, Loki thoughtAnd took the other end a second before Thor activated it and sent them through realms as particles.***Hiemdall, the gate keeper, the all seeing guardian.Even he didn't see this coming.A flash of light, dark and powerful, radiating danger and death, sparked behind him.It glowed, magnificent and morbid as the same time, then brightened to an unnatural white and dissolved with a bang heard in Asgard.Heimdall, who had raised a hand to protect his golden gaze, lowered his arms and was greeted with the sight of two bowing figures.One was green and amber, the other black.Both faced Asgard, both had their heads lowered and both radiated only one thing –DeathHeimdall's eyes watched them both, watched the smoke billowing up from them and watched the weapons in their hands.The golden scepter with its powerful blue orb was the first's weapon of choice.The hammer that no one would lift was the choice of the other.Heimdall's deep voice growled.They moved then, as if his presence was something they only now knew.They stood as one unit, danger and death reeking from them, the scent of the dying, the screams of the agonized.They turned.Heimdall had only time to widen his eyes in shock before a great burst of magic unimaginably strong, hit him.His scream went unheard as he plummeted into the waters below him, his armor sending him into the deepest waters immediately.He wasn't seen after that.The figure, the smaller one, the one responsible for killing the gate keeper, turned to his companion."I expected him to put up more of a fight. The last one did""Doesn't guarantee that this one will, too" the other's resonating voice replied "have not your hopes rise so high that a fightless being disappoints you"The first chuckled "This realm will prove no challenge""Nay" blue eyes glittered "it will not"They turned and faced Asgard, the lights around giving their faces stark shade.Their steps as one, they strode towards the Realm Eternal with a purpose as terrifying as it was strong.***Odin sensed them first.The moment he lost contact with Heimdall, he knew something was wrong. The aged king, both a warrior and awaiting father, surged to his feet with a cry of alarm, startling his beautiful wife, the chosen Queen of the realm.She knew naught of what transpired, except that she had never seen her beloved king such.But before she could inquire, screams erupted from below.***It had been rare, listening to that weapon sound so wet at first.But now, any other sound made by that dreaded hammer would have sounded strange to him.Wet was perfect, the thudding muted by the brains of the unfortunate being as the power of the Hammer of Death spilt their skulls without effort.Blood squirted out of the lumps of flesh and painted red the face of the wielder of the Hammer of Death.He turned his head to the green and amber companion and smiled at what he saw.Hi
