Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It was like falling, except Loki hadn’t moved so much as a finger. His eyes jolted open, his breath hitched, and he could hear the blood rushing.The first things he saw were shadows. A dull colouring of the window blinds, and his own outline against the wall. The sun was barely skimming the horizon, the waters of the harbour. Loki thought for a moment that it was almost morning, and that he had at least a night’s worth of sleep. He checked the time, only to see that it was barely past midnight, and he had forgotten that it was summer.What a nuisance, Loki thought.He pulled the sheets over his head. It was a feeble attempt of stopping the light before it woke him up completely. It already had woken him up completely. He threw off the sheet again. There were shadows on the ceiling. It was far too late for there to be enough light for shadows, but Loki could not fall back asleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw too much light, and he couldn’t sleep.Loki Laufeyson. Oath-Breaker, Shape-Shifter, Trickster God, King of Realms, End-Bringer. Thwarted by bedtime.His eyes slipped close. They were tired. He wished he could sleep. But the moment his eyes closed, he saw bright light, and it made his eyes sting. He almost could feel the warmth of it on his face, and he shivered.His chest hurt. He coughed. He couldn’t stop coughing. He couldn’t see. It was hot. His skin hurt. Something was loud. He did not know what it is. He tried to cover his ears.He wished he could scream. He didn’t—he did not want it to come out as a cry.It was hot.  He couldn’t breathe.Loki tried to move. He couldn’t. He wanted to cover his ears. He couldn’t. He thought it was someone screaming. He knew it wasn’t himself. Because when he finally opened his mouth, all that came out was a whimper.He opened his eyes. The shadows have shifted on his ceiling. He could hear his pulse against his pillow. He turned his head, raised a hand to brush the drapes aside. The sun had moved higher up in the sky. Maybe two hours have passed and he didn’t realise.Loki pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. They stung, still tired. When he moved his hand away, they were damp. He cursed.He breathed heavily. He hated it when his heart races, and he wasn’t on his feet. The way it pounded against his ribs, it made him want to gag.He dragged his hand across his eyes again, and again. His fingers were still damp each time. Forget it—he ran his hand across his forehead. There was sweat along the hairline. He brought his hands before his eyes, turned them around, clenched them into fists. They were pale—dry, a little, and calloused, a little, but unmarred. His guise still held. So he didn’t understand why his heart was racing.He wondered, passingly, if Thor ever had an idea of how much Loki could not sleep because of this. That would have required telling Thor about his dreams though, and the thought made Loki laugh out loud.He sat up, pulled open the blinds. The sun was brighter at this fine hour of what may be three in the morning. The sun was rising and no one was awake. The sea was awake and no one else was.His breath fogged the glass. The sun was rising. He wished he could douse it, sometimes.“Midgard,” he said to himself. As if he had forgotten where he had been, this whole time. Some drunken stupor, which would explain the burning inside. He let out a breath.“Damn.”-“Wakanda,” Tony said, impressed. “Damn.”He toasted his tall glass of mango juice. Natasha snorted.“Jet lag seems to be all said and done,” she said.“Nothing that chronic insomnia can’t fix,” said Tony. He nodded to his drink. “It’s a wonderful recommendation, your highness.”“I see you speaking, but all I can hear is sarcasm,” said T’Challa.“Spare me some credit,” said Tony. “We’ve been waiting for at least half an hour and this drink is the most exciting thing that has happened to me.”T’Challa tutted. Natasha kicked Tony in the back of his knee. Tony would have an excuse to moan about the mundanity of bureaucracy if they weren’t currently sipping some version of mango lassi in the convention center open bar in Wakanda’s capital with the crown prince ergo king of the nation, along with his team of about ten armed guards that watched if either of them did so much as exhale in T’Challa’s direction.“It’s one of the symptoms of diplomacy, Mr. Stark,” said T’Challa. “And today is surprisingly an exception. I would have recommended you both return to your hotel rooms rather than recommend you a drink if it were any other meeting.”“They reacted much more quickly when Doctor Doom tried to blow up central Europe two months ago,” said Tony.“Yes,” said T’Challa. “But that was when something was going to blow up.”“Thankfully not the case today,” said Natasha. She stirred her own grapefruit juice drink. She would have preferred alcohol for the sake of waiting, but Wakanda kept their alcohol to a public minimum. “Or at least not yet.”“Knowing HYDRA, it probably will eventually,” sa
