Tony couldn't pinpoint the moment he decided to die.It was definitely sometime after Ultron though.Sometime after that horrible AI had tried to take over everything, sometime after he and Thor literally put their lives on the line to try and save Sokovia and consequently the world. It was sometime after Pietro had died and Wanda had come home with them, broken and hurting and only a shell of herself after losing her brother. Sometime after JARVIS had...had...gone, and Vision had appeared.And sometime after Steve had kissed him.It hadn't been a big deal, that first kiss--or at least it hadn't started as a big deal.Sometime post-Ultron and Steve had stormed into the lab and shoved Tony up against a wall and snapped that sometimes Tony made him “so angry” and that the resulting fallout from Sokovia was going to “change the entire world and not for the better” and that maybe the next time Tony “created a goddamn experiment” he could make sure it didn't have a will of it's own.And then Steve had wrapped his arms around Tony and whispered that maybe next time Tony could “sit aside and let someone Steve didn't care about so much offer his life in exchange for civilians”. And maybe next time Tony could be “a little less reckless”. And maybe next time Tony could---But Steve hadn't finished that sentence, because he had just kissed Tony instead. Just a short one- firm and no nonsense, just like the man himself.Then he had made this soft desperate sound and dragged one hand through Tony's hair and tilted his head back and kissed him again--and this time Tony's knees were weak before they finally parted.That had been the first kiss. And there had been lots more over the next ten months or so, of varying degrees of passion, and one amazing night there had been more than kissing, and Tony had been able to wake up to Steve still in his bed, looking down at him with something incredible in those dark blue eyes, and for maybe fifteen fucking seconds, Tony had forgotten how awful everything up to this point had been and for maybe fifteen fucking seconds, Tony had been happy.But then, the Accords and the Winter Soldier, and the airport battle and Zemo and Siberia and the surgery to repair his chest and---Actually, you know what? Tony could pinpoint  exactly the moment he decided to die.It was four months after Siberia when the doctors told him that it would take an implant to repair his sternum, and that his heart would never be the same and he would need a pace maker, and oh! Since he already had designed and perfected the arc reactor, and his body had already adjusted to it once, a new arc reactor would accomplish all of those things for him, so lets just put it right back in shall we?It was four months after Siberia when he was apologizing for the hundredth and twelfth time (he had been counting) in another press conference.They only ever asked two questions at these things--- could the world survive with rogue vigilantes like the criminal Avengers on the loose? And could the world survive without the Avengers?Tony had smiled and shrugged and calmly told the reporter the same thing he told them all-- “We have people to protect us, people that operate inside the law, heroes that have been here all along and now are finally getting a chance to step up. And I, as Iron Man, will always keep working to keep the world safe.”And this reporter, like all the others, had scoffed and pointed out that ahem-- wasn't Tony in a compromised physical state? Wasn't the Iron Man under investigation after apparently letting Captain Rogers and the Assassin known as the Winter Soldier go? Was Iron Man anything without the rest of the team? Wasn't Sokovia basically Tony Starks fault anyway?And usually--usually-- Tony could fire back with some smart comment, call on one of his suits for a flashy display...something.But for a minute, there was dead silence in the room, because Tony Stark didn't have anything to say to that. For the first time since the “Stark Industries is no longer making weapons” debacle of a press conference, Tony didn't know what to say, his usual pithy remarks lost as his mind skidded to a stop.He didn't even know he had reached up and rubbed over his chest uuncomfortably, didn't even realize that everyone was staring at him.Because it was at that moment, four months after Siberia, that Tony Stark decided to die.*********************It was easy enough, his plan.Recovering from that awkward, silent moment in that press conference, Tony had sent the reporter a smile and announced that he was working on a new suit, rambled off some letter and number to make it sound official and proudly told the assembled press that thanks to this new suit, Iron Man would be better than ever, and more than enough to protect their city and their country, and that as soon as his prototype was finished he would be sharing his plans with the air force and helping them build suits of their own.Everyone had applauded and Tony had grinned and
