There’s a lot of the mansion to explore, more space than five people could ever need and probably more rooms than any of them, excluding maybe Thor, could ever know what to do with. Halls upon halls are decorated with antiques and paintings and lush, lavish carpets that Steve isn’t too sure people should walk on. Room after room, copies of each other with varying décor. Some are bedrooms with huge mattresses that are too perfect for true comfort, with large wooden dressers that probably haven’t and probably never will see a true owner. Others are offices, some sleek and modern in design, while others are filled with oak desks and liquor cabinets that are still full despite the house not being used in over two years. There are several living areas, dens, a library, a workout room. Steve thinks there may be two kitchens, but one only has two microwaves, three coffee pots, and a refrigerator. Ms. Potts had donated the house to the Avengers after their first altercation as a team against Loki. She didn’t say much as to why, or where it had come from, only that she had an apartment close to SHIELD headquarters and a house in Malibu, and that she wouldn’t need this one. He thought he may have heard a conversation between her and Black Widow, something about how it was her right to do as she pleased with her property, and maybe, in a softer tone, that ‘he would have liked it this way.’ Sometimes this ‘he’ is an empty space beside Ms. Potts. This ‘he’ seems to leave a lot of empty spaces, though no one seemed to really know him save for Ms. Potts and her driver, Happy Hogan. However, this ‘he’ must have owned the house at one point or another. Steve doesn’t ask. Doesn’t feel it’s in his right. Doesn’t think it’s any of his business. More importantly, doesn’t need to. He can feel the ghost of ‘he’ in the house. Not an actual apparition, no misty white lines or strange coincidences that send chills down his spine. There’s just this feeling, a strange niggling around him that he’s walking in a place where someone else walked. A certain déjà vu that has him blinking rapidly and looking at his team to see if they can feel it too. It’s a distinct feeling that someone isn’t there, but that they should be. They’re in the small things that don’t mean much to anyone except for Steve. A series of the number six that Steve isn’t sure is coincidence. Six seats at the kitchen table, six available seats in the living room the team normally inhabits, six armchairs scattered in the library, and six bedrooms are the floor they all sleep in. But there are only five team members. IMCA JARVIS takes surprisingly little time to acclimate too. Steve has seen so many strange things in his life, like a serum that made him physically perfect to weapons that obliterated people from existence, talking computers are kind of...handy. Everything Steve could ever wonder about all he has to do is address JARVIS and ask his question. Anything and everything. Best subs in town; how to get a bank account online, what the hell is a schnoodle…various things that confound him and JARVIS sends him all sorts of links filled with all the information he could ever want on a tiny, plastic screen called a tablet. Even around the house, JARVIS seems to know every little thing. He answers where everything is from the cheese grater in the kitchen to ‘okay, JARVIS, where did this hole in the wall come from?’ He actually kind of likes JARVIS, as much as he thought he could ever like artificial intelligence. And strangely, JARVIS seems to like him. That is an awkward notion to entertain, because he’s an AI. He can’t imagine them having emotions or inclinations towards one human over another. But there are days where Steve is sure that JARVIS is just a little bit shorter with Clint or Natasha, while seeming to talk with Bruce and himself in an affectionate manner. He doesn’t bring this up with the others, because he knows it sounds crazy. It sounds crazy even in his mind. But it doesn’t really bother him. If he’s crazy, it’s a comforting sort of crazy that seems to go with this entire 21st century. So when he is wandering the mansion, all of which he has still yet to traverse despite having lived there for a month now and reaches a section Ms. Potts hadn’t given a tour of, he wastes no time in asking, “Hey, JARVIS?” And he doesn’t care how he feels when he hears the comforting British tones, so close to Peggy’s, “Yes, Captain Rogers?” Steve looks down the narrow staircase which seems to stop in front of a door. “What’s this?” There’s a pause. A very long pause, which isn’t normal for JARVIS in the slightest. For a moment Steve actually wonders if he really did ask his question out loud. It doesn’t happen often but he supposes being in a room deep in the bowels of SHEILD for two months…sometimes his questions just get lost in his head simply for having had no one to ask them to for so long. Then, in a sad tone, almost depressed and longing, JARVIS answers, “
