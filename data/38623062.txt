Work Text:
Peter crawls through the window of his bedroom and takes off his Spider-Man suit. His life might be simpler now that most people don't know his identity, but being a friendly neighbourhood hero is never easy, with all kinds of superhuman villains and criminals on the loose. Parker changes into a fresh set of clothes and heads to the kitchen to prepare some dinner. After a long day of working and crime fighting, he was starving.Interestingly, he finds his fiancee, Michelle Jones, fast asleep on the couch, with a plate of meatloaf on the dining table. She is cuddling a little Spider-Man plushie that he gifted her a couple of months ago, on the anniversary of their renewed relationship. Peter smiled at her. He still cannot believe that he is going to be married to this young lady one day.Peter finishes up his dinner and settles down on the couch next to MJ. He plants a kiss on her cheek and gently shakes her awake. MJ rubs her eyes and turns to face Peter, smiling softly at her lover."Hello, MJ. Did you miss me?" Peter asked."Hehe. All the time, babe." MJ replies, throwing her arms around her future husband.They share a passionate kiss and cuddle on the sofa for the rest of the night, falling asleep in each others' arms. Nothing in the universe can separate this young couple forever.
