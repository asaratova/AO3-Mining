*****************************************
It started innocently enough, with Tony walking in on Bucky, Steve, T’Challa, Clint and Thor all eating breakfast together.They were talking, or rather, ARGUING, quietly but fiercely among themselves, and shut up the moment he walked through the door.“Morning boys.” Tony yawned and ran a hand through his early morning fro, really not noticing how they all looked him over, then looked at each other. Well, he  might  not have noticed if Thor could have been subtle, but they didn't love the demi-god because he was  subtle .“Good Morrow, Anthony.” he intoned, in that mellow baritone, folding big arms across a bigger chest, and looking Tony over with a smile just short of a leer on his face. Tony blinked at him uncertainly, paused halfway to the coffee machine.“Thunderboy, stop looking at me like that.” He looked down at himself, at his bare chest and threadbare pajama pants. “What? Is it my pajama pants? They are a little old I guess. Or my slippers? Say what you guys want, but these are easily the most comfortable things I’ve ever worn.” he grinned down fondly at his worn and faded moccasins. “You guys must just be jealous.” He shuffled back out of the kitchen, clutching a steaming coffee close to his chest.“So one night?” he heard Thor say, and he paused right outside the door, too nosy to ignore the conversation. “Just one?”“The night before and the morning after and that's it.” This was definitely T’Challa, that deep voice sounding even lower, huskier in the morning. Tony shivered a little and grinned. The prince was so hot.“Everybody gets the same amount of time.” Bucky chimed in. “That say it's as fair as it can be, considering the situation anyway.” Tony could almost see him, all earnest blue eyes and early morning scruff. Adorable.“Right. And everyone has to do their own thing, no copying anyone else.” From Clint, who had been drinking orange juice straight from the jug. Sometimes Tony thought Clint did shit like that just to make him smile, other times he thought maybe it was because Clint had just about zero manners.“We will draw numbers to see who gets to go first.” Steve added quietly. “Keep it as random as possible.” Ah yes, there was his favorite stick-in-the-mud Captain. Always one for rules.“Then yes, count me in as a competitor as well.” Thor announced, banging his cup on the table for emphasis.Tony thought for a moment that the statement sounded odd, but Thor said a lot of odd things really, so he shrugged it off.It had been nearly a year since Tony had managed to bring everyone back, pull the team back to the compound after everything had gone so wrong with the Accords. Even Steve was home again, and he had brought both the Wakandan Prince T’Challa, and the Winter Soldier with him as well.It had been an adjustment, to have them in the compound, but they had adjusted well enough. The Black Panther was so charming, with that rolling accent and charming smile, it was hard for anyone to resist. In fact, Tony had a hard time looking away when the warrior smiled, so he didn't. He just stared until he'd looked his fill, and moved on. Technically, T’challa was King now, but even he still referred to himself as the Prince. Tony thought it was maybe because he was still grieving his father.The Winter Soldier, who was back to just Bucky now, had spent months watching everyone warily until he'd realized that no one wanted to hurt him anymore. He had let Tony work on his arm, dialing back the constant pain from the metal limb, and helping him gain even better flexibility with it. Somehow he became fast friends with Clint, and now they spent all of their time together eating entirely too much and generally causing trouble for everyone else. Clint spent most of his time with the team as well, now that he and his wife had separated. Citing “irreconcilable differences” and that Clint hadn't been right, not since New York, they had parted peacefully, and Clint had moved into a room next to Bucky's.Tony had been saddened to hear of his friends life falling apart, but he couldn't deny he was glad the archer was home again. Sometimes Clint was the only reason Tony laughed, sometimes watching Bucky was the reason Tony hung out in the sparring room well after his training session had ended.It worked.Steve seemed more serious these days, more focused. He and Tony had had several conversations about everything, had hugged it out and tried to move on. Some days Tony thought he was adjusting better than the soldier did, but most days they were just fine. Steve insisted that Tony learn better hand to hand combat, so every day for at least an hour he worked with him. And if Tony loved being pinned under that big blonde when they wrestled… well that was neither here nor there.Thor had even left Asgard for the most part, content to fight and live among his human teammates. By far the largest and loudest of the team, his presence kept the compound feeling  alive  and Ton
