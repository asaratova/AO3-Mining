---Charles takes Erik’s fumbled explanation—that, yes, Charles is not entirely alone in his inappropriate attraction (which is actually really only inappropriate from Erik’s side), but they can’t act on it right now, they’re going to have to wait until Charles turns eighteen—with relative equanimity, which should really tip Erik off immediately that something is not right.As it is, though, Erik’s just relieved enough to not have his resolve tested that he doesn’t examine Charles’s acquiescence too closely; this is why he is completely blindsided at the evolution of Charles’s carefully calculated war of seduction, apparently designed to drive Erik completely out of his mind.Charles takes to wearing clothes that Erik suspects have come from the early depths of his closet, because they all fit too tightly, too short, too not enough. Charles stretches up to close a window, and Erik gets lost in the pale band of his lower back that’s practically begging for Erik’s touch.Erik is twenty-three, really, he knows what to do with his cock and everything, he’s not going to make a fool of himself and crumble over Charles’s (absurdly endearing and startlingly effective) lack of subtlety in his seduction attempts.(That is possibly the worst lie Erik has ever told himself.)Charles entirely drops the concept of personal space when he’s with Erik, as well as finding ways to invite himself and Raven over to Erik’s place, before Raven “suddenly remembers” she has other plans that evening.“Raven has friends to go see today,” Charles says the first time this happens, cheerfully, innocently. “We can watch a movie or something at your place, can’t we? Just the two of us?”“I do have friends to go see,” Raven agrees blandly, when Erik corners her for interrogation later. “I have some unidentified friends to go see, and later today I will be in possession of Charles’s Harry Potter boxed set. There’s no correlation between these two events, of course.”“Of course,” Erik says.“No, but really,” Raven says, “if I weren’t shamelessly susceptible to bribery, you understand that I’d be cockblocking the fuck out of you, right?”“I’m glad Charles’s virtue rates so highly with you,” Erik says flatly.“Well, plus, I figure you’re kind of cockblocking enough for the both of us,” Raven says wickedly.“I just want to—do this right,” Erik says, knows that he’s flushing a little at how inept he sounds, how ridiculous, as if this is the 1920s and he’s asking for Charles’s hand; if nothing else, Erik is fully aware of ridiculous this is getting, because the only person who seems to have any problem with this is him.Raven visibly melts at that, but it doesn’t exactly help Erik with his problem, which is that Charles’s persistence is unbelievable. Erik has never jerked off so much in his life.In his bed, in the shower, on the couch sometimes, thinking about how Charles drives over to Erik’s place after class, and inches closer on that very same couch when they sit together until he’s pressed up against Erik’s side, fingers falling oh-so-accidentally onto Erik’s thigh; in Erik’s mind, it’s okay to picture pushing Charles down onto that couch, sucking his cock as greedily as he wants to, watching him go pink and breathless with want, and afterward, when Erik’s fingers are sticky and his heart is pounding, he realizes he’ll never be able to sit on that couch again without going hard. Erik’s whole apartment has become a minefield of fantasies, that wall he’s imagined pressing Charles against and kissing him senseless, the kitchen counter that is the perfect height for him to lift Charles onto so Charles can put his legs around Erik. Erik is in a permanent state of distraction over Charles.Charles is both brimming with confidence and sometimes unsure, the way he backs Erik against a wall and goes up on his toes and kisses him firmly, telling Erik the first time he does so, “Don’t be ridiculous, Erik, it’s only kissing”; the way he blushes, eyes going wide, when he sees Erik watching him and Charles clearly hasn’t even meant to catch Erik’s eye, and the soft pink bow of his mouth parting open makes Erik grit his teeth and wrench his gaze away.Erik is, quite honestly, in over his head here: he’s blunt, and he’s been called aloof, and he doesn’t want much to do with most people; he’s never learned how to be careful with someone, and he has to be careful with Charles, no matter how little Charles wants it—not because he’s young, but because he’s Charles, and he is important.Erik has no idea what he’s doing here, and yet, for all that, he’s never been this happy.He lets Charles surprise him in hallways and push him against things and kiss him, because Charles so clearly wants it, and Erik is only human, and there is nothing like the feeling of Charles tucking himself into Erik’s body like he’s trying to climb inside him; Charles has sly, wandering hands, and Erik laughs, low, against his mouth and traps one by the wrist and watches Charles pout at him.Charl
