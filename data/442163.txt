For Tony, the beginning thoughts of there being a them— as in Tony and Steve together— is like everything else in the fucked-up, train-wreck-waiting-to-happen that he calls his life; it starts off with a bang and a metric fuck-ton of collateral damage.That is to say, Tony’s just been missile bombed through two buildings and a lamp-post, having gotten in the way of an attack meant for fucking Steve; he’s concussed, bleeding from several vital points in his body where his metal suit has bent inward and pierced his organs, and all he can think is a relieved, ‘Thank god he’s okay’ instead of experiencing the usual, ulcer causing mixture of rage and irritation.And yeah, as far as epiphanies go, it’s not the best— in timing, place or content— but it’s his, and Tony’s never been the type of person to not notice something good when he sees it. Granted, that doesn’t necessarily mean that he pursues the things he very obviously needs, commitment and companionship to name some of them; but he still connects the dots, quickly catalogues every single one of his reactions previous to the revelation, creates a linear emotional progression of sorts, gives himself a neat little nod—--and then proceeds to fly back into the fray as though his entire life hasn’t just changed, for better or for worse.Even when the entire mess is cleaned up and over with, he still doesn’t let himself think about it because he doesn’t do things like this, doesn’t take things that will obviously benefit him in the long-run and make his life even the littlest bit more bearable. Because really, there is no one in the world better at punishing him than himself, and fuck knows, he still has so damned much to fix, so damned much to make up for.So, when everything is said and done, he gives everyone his usual grin and starts making his way down whatever road they’re in, babbling about how he knows this kebab place that they should all try because they are just that damned good……and then he promptly passes the fuck out.

When he wakes up again, it feels sort of like he’s being smothered by a hundred or so sheep and everything feels like he’s looking up from underwater; and the first things his eyes manage to land on are a pair of worried baby blues. Immediately, it’s like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders and fuck if he knows why.Hell, it takes him a few minutes to even link the eyes to a person, even though Steve is right there and sort of hard to miss, what with being 6 solid feet of sex and muscles, and that more than anything tells him about what kind of state he’s in. He hasn’t been this slow since he’d woken up clutching a car-battery, stuck in a dank cave in bumblefuck Afghanistan and dealing with the oxymoron that was having a killing heartbeat. But really, thinking about that right now is just sort of depressing, so Tony not-so-casually changes mental tacks and asks what he assumes is his most pressing question.“What happened?”Or at least, that’s what he tries to ask, but his throat is so dry that it comes out sounding like an odd mix between a groan and the crackling of fall leaves.Oh God, he must be on the Good Stuff if he’s waxing poetic about his sore as fuck esophageal tissue.Thankfully Steve, bless his All American, properly beating heart, just gets it. He gently places a straw in Tony’s mouth, and doesn’t make a single comment as Tony finds himself struggling with sucking of all things, even if it’s just water through a tube.Yeah, the irony isn’t lost on him either.“You’ve been out for a few days now, you know,” he says, almost casually as he makes sure that Tony doesn’t choke on his own tongue trying to quench his thirst, “The doctors weren’t even sure that you’d make it in the beginning, said that there were too many perforations and that you were bleeding out faster than they could get blood into you. “And Tony would feel hurt by his tone, actually does feel a temporary twinge in his arc-reactor, except well, he honestly doesn’t expect anything else. After all, it’s not as though they’re best friends or anything; hell they’re barely at a regular friendship and that’s after months of fighting together and each other and just generally being in each other’s spaces. So no, Tony really shouldn’t expect all that much from the man.Really, he figures, almost blasé in his line of thinking, it’s not as though he’s earned that kind of loyalty or respect, so he really shouldn’t be hurting over the lack of it.Nevertheless, in the deepest recesses of the heart that he’s been trying to bury since he was ten and had gotten confirmation that he really isn’t worth much, he sort of is.That is, until he notices how Steve is holding himself, and then he feels himself having the epiphany all over again.Where the blonde’s voice is smooth and devil-may-care, every other part of him is in a state of panicked disarray. There are bags under his eyes, which means that he hasn’t been sleeping enough even by Super Soldier standards; his
