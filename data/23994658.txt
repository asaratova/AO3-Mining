Chapter 1



Summary:

Billy is practicing his magic at the Rock of Eternity with the Wizard's guidance when something goes horribly wrong.



Notes:
So, this ENTIRE thing is gonna take place in a weird amalgamation of movies and comics, okay? So things are gonna be loose, and characters are gonna be in places that movies didn't have them in. Marvel's always had a pretty loose fanon in terms of dates and rosters, so that's what I'm going with.Not gonna spend a lot of time worrying about timelines and instead, I'm gonna worry about telling a good story. Okay? Okay.Enjoy, yall.

Chapter Text
 - - - Captain Marvel took a deep breath in, his legs folded beneath him as he tried to soothe his nerves. He gripped his knees loosely, eyes shut in concentration. "You must clear your mind of all distractions," the Wizard's voice echoed throughout the cavern's walls, ringing in the demigod's ears. He drew in another deep breath before letting it out, trying to push any distraction from his head. He quieted the familiar buzz of the Gods in his mind, focusing on the endless expanse of space just outside the Rock of Eternity's walls. "Focus your energy on what you want to conjure, and will it into existence," the old man's voice rang out in the Captain's ears. It was still strange to hear the man speak, as he was merely a spirit now, only visible while in the Rock Of Eternity. But, as always, Cap listened to the man's instructions. He pictured a pen, something simple, something he could replicate easily when he tried this in his mortal form-- the entire point of this lesson was to get him better at magic while he was Billy, anyways, better to not picture something too difficult for his much smaller and much weaker normal form. Cap's eyes snapped open, glowing gold as he breathed. "Erujnoc a nep," A flare of light and a simple pen fell from the air and into his hands. The glow faded from the demigod's eyes, a smile appearing in its place. "Nice," he said, looking around for the semi-transparent visage of his mentor. "Wizard?" he called out, furrowing his brow in confusion. Where could the old man have gone? It wasn't like him to just disappear in the middle of a lesson. Maybe- maybe this was some kind of vague test? He wouldn't be surprised- Shazam had a tendency to be vague and mysterious. "Okay, I'll just...keep going..." he trailed off, trying not to let it get to him. He said the old man's name, evoking the magical lightning he'd grown so accustomed to to transform him. Light enveloped him and changed his form, stripping him of his godly attributes and replacing the form with that of a 12-year-old boy. Billy shook his smoke and dust away, setting down the first pen he'd conjured in front of him. He stared at it for a moment before taking another look around- surely the wizard was still watching, even if he was no longer visible, right? The 12-year-old shook off the nervousness he felt creeping up his spine- he was sure the Wizard was fine. He had to be. "Okay, clear your mind, and picture it," he said, closing his eyes and picturing the same pen as before. Billy held out his arms, brow furrowing in concentration. The Wizard had explained to him that it was important he learn to control his magic in this form as it was much more unstable than when he was Captain Marvel- is wasn't as strong by any means, but it was still something to be reckoned with since it was so untamed. The last thing Billy wanted to do was hurt someone by mistake, so he'd vehemently agreed to be taught. Still, that didn't mean this was easy. The boy felt a tingle in his spine, crawling up to his neck before shooting through his chest and traveling up his arms. He tried to concentrate despite the tingle, he knew that it was just his magic moving through his body, he knew that it wouldn't hurt him. 
"Erujnoc a Pe--"
 "CHAMPION."  "--AAAGGHH!" Magic shot out from Billy's hands, striking the Rock of Eternity and leaving a smoldering black spot in the stone. Billy stared at it with wide eyes before turning his head towards where the sudden loud voice had come from. Doctor Fate descended from the air, golden boots touching the ground as he looked down at Billy. "Champion," he repeated, his voice slightly less loud, but still booming.  Billy scrambled up, giving the Lord of Fate a confused look. "Doc- Doctor Fate? What are you doin' here? Is something wrong?" he asked, nervous energy rolling off him in waves. It wasn't every day that someone was able to get inside the Rock of Eternity-- much less someone as powerful as Doctor Fate. "I came to speak to your mentor about matters of the Universe- where is Magmarran?" "Uh, I'm- I'm not actually sure. Wait, his name isn't Shazam?" Billy asked, tilting his head and scrambling up from his spot. "That is his name now, yes. Before he became the guardian of the Rock of Eternity, he was Magmarran. Where is he?"  "He's gotta be around here somew
