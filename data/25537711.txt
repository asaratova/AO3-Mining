Work Text:
A week after the press conference where Tony told the world the truth about the mess that was the Avengers, he was feeling much better. Really, it was almost a miracle. It wasn’t just the relief of telling the truth – and being heard and believed – but also of knowing he really wasn’t as alone as he had thought. Even his physical health had improved tremendously. They did say that a positive attitude helped the healing process, and now Tony could say with certainty that it was true. For him, at least.He had developed a new routine – a healthier one – that was doing wonders for him. He’d wake up after an actually restful night’s sleep (no nightmares of doom and death), check his social media feeds, watch a few cute videos Friday selected for him as he ate his breakfast and write a few posts in response to people. Then he would go to the lab to work on SI projects Tony had been neglecting for ages because of the Avengers (including Rhodey’s braces and improvements to the Iron Man and War Machine suits). He would take a break to have lunch and then work some more. He also made time to check in on Rhodey, Pepper and Vision, work on revisions to the Accords and talk to the Accords people and the Task Force responsible for tracking down the fugitive Avengers to see if there was anything he could help them with. In the evening, he would have dinner and relax with a movie or some more cute videos from Friday’s selection. There was a lot of work, of course, but it no longer felt like rolling up a stone that was inevitably going to come crashing down on him anymore. There was no worry that the Avengers would undercut him, or demand more impossible things, or – worse – create even more problems for him to solve. This time, at the end of each day, he felt like he had accomplished what he had set out to do, and was one step closer to his personal long-term goals as well as those for planetary defense.There was still a lot of speculation about the fate of the Avengers, but this time Tony didn’t feel like it was all his responsibility. He didn’t have to fix it all by himself, especially since he hadn’t been the one who had broken things in the first place – no matter what Rogers had claimed. There were lots of people working to ensure a future for the Avengers (and by Avengers he meant himself, Rhodey and Vision – and whatever new members they managed to eventually add). Plus – wonders of wonders – people were actually on his side. Whenever Rogers and the others turned up, they would be faced with a great deal of hostility and anger. There were, of course, still Cap fans out there, people who refused to believe that their hero had feet of clay, and shouted that there was a conspiracy against ‘Cap’ – Hydra, communists, even Tony the Evil Overlord had been pointed out as the source of it. If Tony didn’t already know how insane people could be, he would have been surprised by all the nonsense some people were sprouting. As it was, though, he didn’t have to do anything about it. Whenever one of those nutcases made a nuisance of themselves, someone with an actual brain would rebuke them with facts and evidence – which didn’t change the lunatics’ minds, of course, but it was nice to see anyway.All in all, Tony was confident that Rogers and his buddies would be taken care of, and Tony wouldn’t have to lift a finger about it anymore. He could just kick back and relax – and watch the fireworks when they inevitably happened. It would be glorious. Until then, though, Tony didn’t have to give those bastards any more of his time; he had much more important things to focus on, and people who were much more deserving of his attention.Tonight, for instance, he was going out with Pepper. They had had a long talk after he’d gotten his head on straight again, and had agreed to try again. Tony had realized that a lot of the problems with their relationship – and the reason Pepper had asked for a break in the first place – was because he had been so worried about the Avengers and all the battles he’d had to fight on that front that he had neglected Pepper and himself. He had become grouchy, stressed and irritable, unable to find joy in anything. No wonder Pepper had wanted to jump ship.Over the last few days, Tony had finally realized how toxic his relationship with the Avengers had become. Instead of it being something positive in his life – a way to deal with the recurring fear of a new invasion – it had been a source of anxiety, frustration and pain. Getting rid of them was the best thing that could have happened to him, really. He would be a lot happier about it if not for the heavy price that freedom had cost him and many other people.He wasn’t going to dwell on it anymore, though. He’d been given a new lease on life (literally, since Rogers had almost killed him), and he wasn’t about to squander it. He was going to get Pepper back, sort out the Accords, continue his work with SI and bask in the public’s support. And, when the
