Chapter 1: in the beginning
    




Chapter Text
The air around him was suffocating.  Tiny particles of dust floated past him, either remnants of the fight they’d just bombed, or the flesh of the fallen - the price of their failure for all to see.  He shifted slightly, and he winced as the blade in his abdomen moved with him. The nanoparticles sealing up his wound weren’t made to last for long periods of time - they were only meant to stave off death until he could get to a hospital, or a half-decent first aid kit. He could only hope that one of the ships had medical supplies on board.  Tony clenched his hands into fists, and fought back a sob. His hands were still covered in dust. He tried to stand, and tripped, landing on his side which only served to aggravate his wound further. He lay there for a second, panting, then took a deep breath, and went to stand up again.  “He did it.”  Tony suppressed a wet snort, and coughed - spitting out the bloody bile that had risen in his throat. He glanced over at the blue alien beside him, and he wondered if she had known anyone on the planet. "I’m sorry.” Blue looked down at him almost questioningly. “About Gamora. And the Guardians.” She huffed. “They were idiots.” She averted her eyes. “I’m sorry about your son.” Tony flinched, whipping his head around to stare. “He isn’t my son. We aren’t-” He closed his eyes. “We weren’t like that.” The alien just looked at him for a few moments, then, after a moment of hesitation, she grabbed him by the waist, and dragged him up to stand. Embarrassingly enough, even with the added height the suit gave him, he was still slightly shorter than her.   “Do you have a ship?” Tony waved his hand towards the giant donut they’d arrived in, and smiled sardonically. “I don’t think that mine is getting off the ground any time soon.” As if on cue, a large piece of plating near the hull dropped off the side, kicking up an abundance of dust into the thin air.  “Quill. He had a ship. The Benatar. We can use that.” Blue strode forwards, and he followed, clutching his side. She put a surprisingly gentle arm around his shoulders. They walked forwards slowly, mindful of every step, worried that something might jostle him and push the blade deeper into his gut.  “Do you need medical treatment for your side?”  For a single, fleeting moment, he considered saying no. Then, he thought of Pepper, and Rhodey, and Happy, and all the other people on Earth that  needed  him. He nodded. “Yes. The sooner, the better.”  Blue looked at him, almost knowingly, before nodding. “There should be supplies on The Benatar. Unless it hasn’t been stocked up since their last battle.” They stewed in the silence for a moment more, taking tiny, wobbling steps towards the ship. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the alien slot her arm back into its socket with a hiss, and a burst of sparks. He winced, pausing for a moment to rub his chest, taking care not to dislodge any of the nanites. When they made it to The Benatar, she forced the doors open with a screech that made him wince, and she pulled him inside by the sleeve.  He saw a chair and a table, along with a device that resembled a fridge. A walkman dangled from a strange hook, and an array of video games, stacks of stuffed animals, and various knives littered the floors. A sensor hung over a group of racks with dirty dishes lined on top, and small mechanical parts that he recognized from the cars he tinkered with regularly were strewn over the counter. Tiny remnants of the people that the Guardians were before.  Tony collapsed into the nearest seat, and let out a quiet groan. His stomach ached. "Tony.” Blue looked at him, confused. “My name. Tony. Tony Stark.”  “Nebula.”  “Nebula. Nice name. Appropriate. Given, you know. Space.” Nebula looked at him with an odd expression on her face, and gestured for him to stand.  “Where are we going Stark? Terra?”  “Um. Yes. Definitely. I mean, unless you have somewhere else you need to go?” He stood, and blood rushed to his head, making him sway on his feet. He wondered if Pepper was still alive. Rhodey. Happy. Harley.  May  . His eyes fluttered, and he imagined telling May that her son was dead, and he wasn’t ever coming back. Would never smile at them again. Never swing through the streets again. Never, never,  never .  “No.” He distantly recalled that he had asked her a question. He thinks that the snap, no, the  decimation , must have destroyed everything she could have come home to.  They walked over to a screen in what he assumed was the control room, and Nebula cursed in a language he didn’t understand.  “I assume something is wrong?” Tony said dryly.  “The engines are busted. Must have been hit sometime during the fight.” Tony almost let out a string of curses himself. He had no clue what alien technology looked like, and aerospace was always more Rhodey’s thing anyways. He glanced over anyways, and was bombarded by a sea of symbols and characters that were completely alien
