“Pete, just take the shot.” Johnny came a few inches short from sloshing the transparent violet liquid onto Peter’s brand-new sweater, and he would’ve if the brunette hadn’t taken a step back. He knew it was coming of course; his heightened reflexes didn’t just work on stray bullets and punches. Peter let out a small huff of air and pushed the shot back towards his blond companion. “Not today, Storm, have that one on me.” Johnny didn’t look too offended. He just shrugged to himself and downed the shot with a little mumble of what might’ve been ‘Don’t mind if I do.’ but at this point Johnny was slurring pretty badly and Peter was probably mistaken. He gripped the sleeve of Johnny’s jacket with his thumb and index finger and pulled him gently through the throng of people in the crowded college bar. He pushed Johnny into a booth and slid in behind him, bumping thighs. He knows any minute now Johnny’s going to try to make a move on him, and Peter’s going to have to strongly decline, and may or may not have to web him to the bunk bed later on. Johnny kind of lost his standards after beer number seven so there had been more than one incident over the past year of living together, but Peter had grown smart and just took initiative before things could progress. He’d known Johnny for quite a few years now, through the Avengers, and rooming with a friend a little older was a lot nicer than rooming with a complete stranger, even if he tried to make advances on you after a few cocktails. “Oh shit, man-“ Johnny suddenly slid under table, fumbling and knocking over a few empty shot glasses on the way down. “You okay, buddy?” Peter smirked at Johnny and his weird antics, but he was genuinely confused. “No.” Johnny peered over the edge of the table to the bar and pointed, “At the bar in the red hoodie, I owe ‘em money.” Peter began cleaning up the mess Johnny had made on the table. “He won’t leave me ‘lone, an’ I’m kinda scared of ‘em.” Peter rolled his eyes, “Why are you scared of him?” He followed where Johnny had pointed and noticed the guy he was talking about. He was facing away, hood up, and leaning over the bar heavily, but Peter could still tell that he was bulky and wide, but he filled the hoodie he was wearing in ways that showed he was all muscle. “You’re THE Human Torch, Johnny. Yeah, that guy has 75lbs on you, easy, but he’s just a guy.” Johnny began shaking his head wildly, “No! I owe him money because of a poker match at one of Logan’s parties, he’s a mutant, and he’s gonna kick my ass!” The blond was pretty much completely under the table at this point, legs bent uncomfortably to fit under it without touching the gum. Peter was in awe at the way Johnny was contorting his body in his current hammered state, but apparently seeing this mutant had sobered him up a bit. “What’s a guy who’s friends with Logan doing at a college bar? Do you really owe him that much money that he’d come looking for you?” The guy got up to go to the washroom, but still didn’t turn to face their direction. “To be honest, I don’t really remember. Hell, I don’t remember much of that night, but I do remember a very angry voicemail in the morning from Logan, and some Saw-worthy threats.” “Is that Johnny Storm I hear?”  Peter was sure he jumped for different reasons than Johnny at the deep, booming voice beside them that came out of nowhere. He turned quickly, eyes wide like a doe, and was met with the man that had been sitting at the bar. His face was somewhat obscured by the shadow cast on his face by the hood and the angle of the lights, but Peter could make out a distinct jawline and the shape of his eyes. “Johnny, it’s Wade! Wade Wilson, from Logey’s New Years party! How’s it going, bud?” Wade slapped him on the shoulder, and slipped into the booth beside Johnny. Johnny slid back up into his seat, shaking like a leaf. “H-hey, Wade.” He stammered, “What brings you here?” Wade raised a hand to signal a waitress, and that’s when Peter noticed it; his hand was covered in scars, deep and shallow, inflamed and dull. Peter figured that he was probably covered in them, and that’s why he had his hood up. “I’m here to see Terry, actually, I just thought I’d come check out this place beforehand, I had some time to kill.” Johnny looked visibly more relaxed, but he was still on-edge. “So I take it you’re still together?” “Nah-“ Wade shook his head, “Terry’s got lots of things on her mind right now. Between work, and Jamie, and all that shit.” He shrugged, “We’re still close, but we just both knew it wasn’t working.” The waitress dropped a beer on the table beside him, and he said a quick thanks. Johnny exhaled deeply, “Woah, man, I thought you were still mad about that money. I was sure I was a goner.” Wade paused bringing his beer to his lips, “Money?” Torch’s mouth gaped like a fish, “The money I owed you… from that poker game…” “Oh my god, Torch,” Wade suddenly burst out into whole-body laughter, and it startled Peter yet again. “Joh
