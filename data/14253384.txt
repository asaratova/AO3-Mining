Chapter 1: Born to Die
Cold dread pooled in the pit of Harry’s stomach at the realization.  It was enough to make him want to vomit, as if doing so could somehow cleanse himself.But it was futile, nothing could cleanse him.  He was a horcrux.  It had occurred to him as a passing thought as he and Dumbledore were discussing the identities of Voldemort’s remaining horcruxes, yet Harry immediately knew, deep down, that it was true.What was it that the headmaster had said in his second year?  That Voldemort had left some of his powers in him?  It made Harry want to laugh bitterly, did Dumbledore know, even then?The wizened headmaster’s countenance grew weary as he no doubt saw Harry's inner turmoil.“I have to die, don’t I?” Harry said simply.“I’m sorry, Harry.  I wanted to spare you the burden of this knowledge for as long as possible.”He didn’t want to die.  Especially not now when he’d found something worth living for.  For the first time, he’d dared imagine what a future after defeating Voldemort would look like.  A small house just for Ginny and him.  Them lying in bed together, talking, kissing, and more.  Going to dinner with Ron and Hermione.  Massive family get-togethers at the Burrow.  A child with Weasley red hair and emerald green eyes.Harry’s eyes stung and his throat burned. Tears began sliding down Harry’s cheeks despite his best attempt to hold them back.“Harry…” The headmaster trailed off, for once at a loss of words.Without another word, Harry bolted.-----Ginny found him first, holed up in the Room of Requirement, sitting on a sofa hunched over himself.  She seemed to have a second sense about him.  When he had once asked her about it, she told him, somewhat embarrassed, that years of ‘Harry watching’ were paying her dividends now.She took one look at his tear soaked face and rushed to him, kneeling in front of him.“Harry.  What’s wrong?” She asked tenderly, taking his hands in hers.She was so alive.  And beautiful.  And passionate.  If he looked in her eyes, he knew he’d see love that could drive him to his knees.  Tears returned.   This is what you’re going to lose.Ginny’s hand cupped his cheek, brushing his tears away.  “Love.  Please.  You’re scaring me.”“I’m going to die.” He finally managed to croak out.She gave him that blazing look that he loved. “Harry, you can’t think like that.  I believe in you.  And you’re not going to be alone.  You have people who love you who’ll be by your side the entire way.”Harry’s smile was bittersweet as Ginny gave her impassioned speech, even as tears continued unabated.  God he loved her.And so he told her.  He told her about how Tom Riddle split his soul into pieces in order to cheat death.  He told her about the diary.  He told her about what they thought the others might be.  Then he told her about the final horcrux.Him.Watching her expression turn from determined to shocked to heartbroken would have been enough to drive him to tears, had he not already been at that state. “No!” She gasped as tears appeared; her voice was as raw as he felt.She choked back sobs, her face marred by grief the likes of which he’d never seen before. “I’m sorry.”  He told her, but it felt hollow. Suddenly, Ginny gripped his shirt, pulling her face level with his. “No!  You’re not going to die!”“Ginny…”“NO! I’m not going to lose you! I CAN’T!” Her grip was painful as she shouted desperately “There’s another way.  There has to be.”“Dumbledore said there isn’t.”          “I don’t care!  I’m not giving up on you Harry Potter.”Even through the tears, the fire was back in her eyes, and it kindled the faintest spark of hope in Harry.  Somehow, Ginny still believed.And then she kissed him like her life depended on it.  Ginny plundered his mouth desperately as she crawled onto his lap.  Later, Harry would reflect how much better this was than the last teary kiss he had in the Room of Requirement, but at the moment he could hardly think of anything but the feel of her lips and tongue, the way her hands cupped his face, and the frantic little noises Ginny was making.-----Telling Ron and Hermione was almost as hard as telling Ginny. Hermione had been inconsolable, bursting into tears and clinging to Harry.  Ron hadn’t handled it much better.  While Harry’s vision was obscured by bushy brown hair, Harry heard what had to be Ron’s fist connecting with the wall.But amazingly, after the shock wore off, they followed Ginny’s lead.  They vowed not to give up on him, and promised to try to find another way.Hermione spent hours every day in the room of requirement.  Ron and Ginny tried to help at first, but after a few days Hermione’s research had gotten far too advanced for them to follow.  Harry had looked in once and saw that the walls (converted to chalkboards) were filled with scribbled arithmetic equations and runes that he couldn’t even begin to decipher.  The tables were
