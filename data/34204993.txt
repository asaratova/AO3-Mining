Chapter 1: Fight Sex - Alcide Herveaux
    




Chapter Text



The pack thought that you and Alcide were going to tear each other apart soon.
You hadn’t taken well to your pack being absorbed into his, challenging his authority at every turn and the other wolves could sense the growing time bomb of tension. You thought you had a right, as the previous Packmaster’s daughter, to rule but Alcide never agreed to let you fight for the title.
You stepped up your game, increasingly nasty words, insults about his bravery and strength and there was a point where you thought he might lose it, attack you but he held himself together at the last moment.
“Accept the pack or leave,” he growled at you, eyes flashing yellow. “I don’t have time for your bullshit.”
“If you can’t even manage me, you won’t ever run this pack right,” you hiss back, knowing a small gathering of wolves was starting behind you, curious about the raised voices. “You look weak when you let me get away with doing this.”
“So I should just beat you down? Is that what you want?”
“You know what I want, Herveaux and you won’t do it because you’re a fucking coward.”
“I’m not afraid of an arrogant she-wolf,” he’s starting to crack, to come chest to chest with you. “And if you don’t stop, I’ll kill you.”
“Then let me challenge you for Packmaster and get rid of your problem.”
“No.”
“Scared I’ll win?”
Alcide is livid now. You know you’ve caught him on a bad day, close to the full moon and when he was already stressed about the recent vampire attacks.
“You want this so bad? Fine. I accept your challenge but if I win, I’m gonna fuck you in the dirt in front of this whole pack.”
“Oh? Didn’t know you saw me that way, Herveaux,” you play coy. “Okay then. You win, you fuck me and I’ll be your bitch from here on out.”
“Agreed,” he steps back, unbuttoning his flannel shirt before looking to the other wolves. “Gather round. This cub wants to challenge for my title.”
“Are you sure about this?” your friend Jolene whispers as you hand her your own shirt. “He took out your dad.”
“I’m not gonna stop until he makes me submit or kills me,” you look at her out of the corner of your eye.
“Yeah but submitting means you’re giving us all a show with someone you hate.”
“At least he’s very easy on the eye,” you drag your gaze down his muscled back as he’s talking with his second. “He’s a fucking ass but he’s pretty.”
“You know, you’re crazy but I’ll be your second if you want me,” she puffs out air. “But don’t come cryin’ to me when you’re knocked up with Herveaux pups down the line.”
“I’d be honoured if you were my second,” you pat her on the shoulder. “Have a little more faith in me though, yeah?”
“You’re scrappy but you’re an idiot,” Jolene stretches her arms. “Good luck.”
You approached the designated patch of land, standing a few feet away from Alcide as the elder went through the rules and traditions. You barely listened to that though, concentrating on how the Packmaster was standing, what move he might make first based on that and the vibrations of his body as he was trying to keep himself in check for now.
The exact moment the elder announces the fight has started, you knew Alcide was going to lunge at you. He favoured brute strength and aggression over any strategy. That meant you ducked to the side before delivering a kick to his spine that had him stumbling.
“Underestimated me, huh?” you taunt him. “Thought it was gonna be that easy?”
“I’m gonna put you in your place,” his voice is taking on the wolf qualities, his fury reaching apoplectic levels given some of your old pack are laughing at him.
You manage to dive through his legs as he’s charging again and grab his ankle, flipping him onto his face but he’s up far too quickly, more agile than you’ve given him credit for. Your world revolves as he catches you with a punch to the face that has you spinning and trying to regain your footing before he’s lifted you off your feet and slammed your back into the grass.
“Submit!” he yells, trying to corral your arms but you jab him in the throat and he wheezes as you wriggle free.
Shoulder barging him over, you get on top of him, hitting him over and over until his nose and mouth are bloodied. It hits a fever pitch where your old pack is cheering madly, baying for more violence as Alcide’s original pack is wincing at the blows.
In a flash, his huge hands come around your ribs, shoving you away with so much force you roll over twice. Disoriented and dizzy, you don’t see him approaching as he tangles up your limbs, flattening your body under his with his weight and leaning his elbows over your arms to keep them pinned.
“Submit,” you can feel him shaking with rage.
“No,” you spit back, still struggling.
When he headbutts you and then manages to get his teeth around your throat, that’s the point you know this is over. If he bites down, you’re dead.
“I submit!” you croak out, feeling the pressure cutting off your air and bruises starting to form already.
He eases off and sits up more,
