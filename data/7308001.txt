Edwin Jarvis, or simply Jarvis as he’s known, has served the Stark family for a great many years already by the time the lady of the manor finally conceives.Sir informs him first of course, as is appropriate, and then Ma’am gives him instructions as to what she wants the household staff to do in order to prepare for the new addition to the family.Jarvis listens, takes note of all instructions and orders, and does his best to quiet his misgivings.It is not his place to cast doubt but Jarvis must admit, if only to himself, that the idea of bringing a child into Stark Manor is … disquieting.Maria Carbonell had been a vibrant young woman when Howard Stark had married her, beautiful, brilliant, and filled with Italian passion and drive.  Their marriage had seemed a good idea, had seemed like the meeting of two like-minded and complimentary personalities who would both support and elevate each other.And yet, over the years, Jarvis has watched as they both changed.More importantly Jarvis has watched as Howard Stark changed.Mr. Stark has always been high-strung, always been a man of extreme highs and lows.  He’s always been almost incandescent on his good days and a murky void on his worst.  Working with and for him has always been equal parts trial and adventure.Truthfully Peggy, in all her magnificent strength and competence, has always been one of the few who could ground him from time to time.  Maria had, in the beginning, been another.  Sadly those times have grown further and further apart as the years have passed.As a result Jarvis has been forced to watch rather helplessly from the sidelines as a coldness, a darkness, slowly settled into both Howard and Maria in turn.Howard falls deeper and deeper into the bottle, becomes more extreme in his highs and lows, and in response Maria buries herself in life as a cold society wife.It is unfortunate and sad in many ways but Jarvis adjusts as all those in his position do.  It is, after all, not his place to neither judge nor interfere.Eventually Howard staunchly becomes Sir and Maria Ma’am in a way that goes beyond the respect Jarvis has always shown his employers.Still, Jarvis has to admit, despite their flaws Sir and Ma’am are both, in their own ways, still great people.Fit to be parents?Well Jarvis is less sure about that.~~~When the time comes Jarvis remains at the manor in order to finish any last minute arrangements that must be made for the arrival of the son Sir and Ma’am have both been anticipating.The house staff are all in a tizzy, torn between equal parts excitement over the prospect of a child being added to the manor and dread in the face of Sir and Ma’am’s infamous tempers should something not meet their standards.Jarvis gets them all in line and working with brutal efficiency.The manor is scrubbed from top to bottom with even more attention to detail paid than normal.  The nursery is stocked with everything the baby might need, and Lydia, the wet nurse Jarvis had personally vetted, is settled comfortably into the room next door for convenience sake.Now all there is left to do is to wait for the arrival of the new young sir.~~~Jarvis knows something is amiss as soon as Sir and Ma’am return to the manor.He meets them at the door and steps out to grab the luggage from the car.  Sir storms past him into the manor and heads towards his workshop without a word, his face twisted in dark anger.  Ma’am glides in behind him calmly, face blank and shoulders straight.  The birth was hard on her Jarvis knows, but she’s as poised and elegant as always if a bit paler than normal.Jarvis, for once, doesn’t linger on either of them though.  Instead his attention is stolen by the bundle of blue that’s been left behind in the car seat.  Jarvis carefully pulls the babe from the car and makes his way into the manor.“Ma’am,” he calls and when she turns he steps forward to hand the child to her but Ma’am doesn’t give him a chance to say or do much else.  Instead she waves him off impatiently before she glides off towards her sitting room, the babe left behind without a backwards glance.Jarvis is momentarily speechless but his attention is quickly captured by a soft cooing noise from the bundle in his arms.Jarvis looks down, catches sight of vibrant blue eyes and thick black hair, and feels his heart melt.“Hello young sir,” Jarvis whispers to the babe in his arms, “welcome home.”~~~Jarvis takes the babe to the nursery to settle him down personally.  Lydia will be in charge of his everyday care until he is older but Jarvis rather likes the idea of being the first of the household to tend to him.It’s while he’s staring down at the babe, who is red faced and naked, wailing unhappily where Jarvis has stripped him down to change his diaper and clothes, that Jarvis receives a shock.The young sir is, in fact, a young miss instead.Oh dear.On autopilot Jarvis dresses her, walks her around the nursery until she eventually calms and he can finally settle her down into the lux
