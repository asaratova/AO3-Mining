Stark Tower was not as ugly on the inside. Steve could even forgive it for blocking the natural light that used to turn Grand Central into an artist's dream; he still couldn't believe the sun no longer slanted through the station like it used to. Well, it would be a few years yet before Grand Central was back in working order anyway. In its absence, the lobby of Tony Stark's New York headquarters was doing a good job stealing Steve's breath. A series of glass cylinders served as elevators, filtering light through the first thirty stories into a lush garden ringed with blue pools of flitting goldfish. It was something out of a fairytale, and yeah, Steve was getting pretty used to staring since he'd woken up from the ice, but this was something else. "Captain?" Steve turned to find Pepper Potts, the willowy redhead he'd seen at Stark's side in television spots and magazine spreads, standing beside a spray of Bird of Paradise in a white sheath dress, tablet in the crook of her arm. "Miss Potts." He shook her hand, feeling very out of place in his khakis and flannel shirt. All around them, men and women in sharp suits milled like ants, always working away at their tiny phones or clipboard-computers. "Please, call me Steve. I'm, uh, off duty."Her smile seemed sincere. "Of course. It's Pepper to you, then."Steve opened his mouth to ask about Tony, because that was why he'd come. He didn't like the way things ended with Loki and the invasion. Well, they won—that was fine. But he'd called Stark a coward. Said he wasn't the type to lay himself on the line. And God, Steve had been wrong. He'd been so, so wrong, and it was eating him up. There hadn't been a good time to say so, what with the team always being there, and Steve figured a late apology would be better than none at all. But before he could ask Pepper where Tony was, the man himself swooped through the front door in brand new sneakers and crisp pinstripes and sunglasses, flanked by what looked like every reporter that wasn't still covering the reconstruction of the city. "Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark!" their voices echoed in the chamber of the lobby. "Pepper. Elevator? If you would," Tony drawled. "And furnish these folks with the quotes they need. They followed me all the way from the UN. It's adorable." Pepper shot Steve an apologetic smile and cut through the crowd smoothly, drawing them away from Tony while at the same time keying open what looked to be a private elevator with her tablet. Tony sailed by Steve without even a glance, and might have kept going if Steve hadn't called out. "Busy day?" Tony spun and removed his sunglasses, still walking backwards. "Oh, hey, Cap. Yes, actually. Full schedule. Met Pepper? Of course you have, she meets everyone. Did she show you the fish? I like the big one. I call him Goldy." He walked right into the waiting elevator and slid his sunglasses into his breast pocket. The doors closed on his wide grin. "Ciao." Steve mouthed the word chow before he got it, shaking his head. It had been stupid to show up like this without any warning; of course Stark wouldn't have time to see him. The man was running half the world, it seemed like. When he wasn't too busy being a fat-headed, grandstanding— Deep breath. Steve was here to say sorry, after all, not get in another fight."Man, you sure scared him." Steve turned to find Bruce Banner slouched next to the koi pond, a greasy paper bag in one hand, a soda cup in the other. As he watched, Dr. Banner took a long sip from his cup. Something light-colored, like ginger ale maybe. Right, no caffeine. "Scared him?" Steve frowned. "Maybe if he's scared of being double-booked, which I doubt.""No, I mean," Bruce said around his straw, "he knows why you're here. And he'd rather not listen to you say how sorry you are, you know? He's not really good at the whole feelings thing, don't know if you noticed." "But—I didn't—and, wait, how did you know—?" Bruce shrugged, pointing with his straw. "This is the first time you've come to Stark Tower, and the only reason you'd do that is to speak to Tony. You're in civvies, so it's not official SHIELD business. And you've been sending mopey, self-flagellating glances his way ever since you finished your shawarma." He lipped the straw back into his mouth. "Doesn't take a genius.""Yeah." Steve sized up Banner. "It doesn't, and yet here you are." He cleared his throat, thinking of ways to divert all that brainy attention. "What are you doing here, anyway? Thought you'd be halfway back to Calcutta by now." "Kolkata," Bruce corrected. "And I would be, except Tony asked me to stick around the R&D department and take a look at that stick Loki left behind. It emits low-level gamma radiation just like the tesseract, and I have a theory that its mind-controlling properties are a result of temporary cellular mutation of the—" Steve tried to follow, but Bruce must have noticed how his eyes glazed over, because he gave a small, self-conscious smile and said, "
