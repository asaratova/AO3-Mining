Avengers Groupchat

 
Stark: So, I have an idea Mrs. Potts: Oh God.How much damage control will we need? I have 176 knives: i volunteer to clean up any crime scenenone of you fuckers can hide evidence to save your lives Stark: Nat NO.And Pepper, love of my life, I promise it’s not … too dangerous Mrs. Potts: Alright, full scale damage control it is. Stark: Wow, Pep. Feeling the love there. Caw Caw: I mean, she’s not wrong Bruce: Sorry Tony, but I have to agree with Pepper; anything you class as ‘not too dangerous’ is instantly concerning. Stark: Only you would use a semicolon in a text, Bruce.As I was saying, I think we should make the kid an official Avenger. Bucky: the kid as in peter parker?? spider-man?? Stark: Yes, that kid.What other kid would I mean? I have 176 knives: to be fairyou do have a thing for adopting random children Stark: I do not have a thing for ‘adopting random children’. Bruce: … Mrs. Potts: Sure, Tony.But yes, I think it would be very nice to add Peter to the Avengers. He may be young, but he’s certainly proven himself. We all know Peter will be in danger regardless and, honestly, I think that making him an official Avenger will protect him more than anything. Caw Caw: Agreed. Hawk: Ok so idea Bucky: oh godthis is even worse than iron ass Hawk: Shut up old man Bucky: who are you calling old mr grey hair Hawk: Oi! Mrs. Potts: Alright kids, that’s enough. Hawk: I’m not a kid! Mrs. Potts: Clint. Hawk: Yes ma’am sorry ma’am Mrs Potts: Thank you Clint.What was your idea? Hawk: So if we’re going to make the Spiderling an Avenger, shouldn’t we add him to this chat as well? Stark: … FineBut on one condition. No one corrupts the child. Hawk: Wouldn’t dream of it :). Stark: That was ominous, but OK?
