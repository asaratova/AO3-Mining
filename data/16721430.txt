Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Tony had worked the night away in his home workshop again. He had attended an awards thingy that evening, and it had been so completely boring compared to the night in he had wanted to have (pizza night and tinkering in the lab with Peter) that he had gone straight downstairs almost as soon as he got home, only stopping to change into casual clothes and check on Peter, who was already in bed when Tony got back.The only reason Tony knew when it was morning (as in, normal human wake-up time) was because JARVIS started talking for a reason other than rattling off project specs when Tony asked for them.“Sir, Peter has been awake for fifteen minutes and is requesting entry to the workshop.”Tony looked up, blinking a little. “What time is it?” If it was the middle of the night and Peter had a nightmare, he would need to have a talk with JARVIS about the Do Not Disturb setting. (Mainly, reminding him that Peter+nightmares=HUGE EXCEPTION.)“It is 8:18 AM, sir.”Tony let out a sigh of relief. “Let him in, JAR.”“Right away, sir.”The glass door unlocked remotely, and within moments Tony could just see it open and close over the top of his computer screen as he put everything away. He was working on something for the military, he didn't want Peter anywhere near it.“Daddy?” a still-sleepy little voice called from near the door.“I'm here, Petey, just a minute,” Tony called back, shoving the last of his tools in a drawer and going to find his son, wiping his hands on a rag.Peter had wandered a short way into the maze of the workshop looking for Tony, and Tony found him standing near DUM-E and Butterfingers' charging stations. He was still wearing his pajamas, but Tony noted proudly that he had taken the time to put on a pair of Velcro sneakers (mismatched, Tony realized with a fond pang); Tony and Pepper were constantly having to remind him to wear shoes in the workshop, in case there was something sharp on the floor.Tony came up behind Peter and caught him around the middle with one arm, tickling him just a little bit to make him squeal and giggle. “There you are, you little adventurer,” he teased, swinging Peter up high enough that he squealed again, then settling him on his hip and holding him so they were face to face. “Sleep good?”“Mmhmm,” Peter said, nodding so hard that the curls on his forehead bounced.“Good,” Tony said, craning his neck to kiss Peter on the cheek. “How about some breakfast?”“Yeah!” Peter cheered.Tony wasn't really hungry, but he ate breakfast with Peter anyway, just because it didn't make sense not to; he hadn't eaten since the night before and he probably should. Besides, six was probably a little too young for Peter to learn that sometimes people forgot to eat for twelve hours or more at a time. Tony also took the opportunity to make himself a pot of coffee, which would probably be gone by noon.After they ate, Tony sent Peter to get dressed, helping where needed (Peter didn't quite have the dexterity yet for things like buttons and zippers and shoelaces), then Peter followed him back down to the workshop, so instead of going back to the military project from before, Tony pulled out one of the side projects that had no potential for hurting Peter in any way.Peter loved watching Tony work, and even though Tony wasn't sure how much the six year old understood, he was always happy to answer any questions Peter had. Sometimes Tony would let him help with small things, like twisting a screw in or fitting something into place.Tony worked while Peter watched for quite a while.Then Pepper spoiled their fun.She came bursting into the lab, looking as exasperated as ever. Tony's back was to her, but Peter could see her.“Tony!” Pepper called.Crap.“Hey, Pete, how mad does Pepper look?” Tony said around a mouthful of screws.Peter looked, and giggled. “You better hide, Daddy,” he said, his nose scrunching adorably.“Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago,” Pepper continued, coming around so that she was in Tony's line of vision.Well, crap. Tony had forgotten about the Jericho presentation in Afghanistan.“That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there. Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?” Tony said, still focusing on his work and going for his best “I careth not” attitude.Pepper fixed him with a Look. “I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.”“Hi, Aunt Pepper!” Peter piped up, waving cheerfully from his perch on the workbench.Pepper looked at him and her face softened for a minute. “Hi, Peter.” She turned back to Tony. “Tony.”“Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?” Tony grumbled, still not looking up.“Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.” Pepper plowed forward.“Is it a good representation of his spring period?”“No. The Springs was actually the
