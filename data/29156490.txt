Chapter Text
Two people in the whole world know Peter Parkerâ€™s secret.

Tony Stark knows his secret. Tony Stark seems to know all about him. Evidently, he had his people dig up everything there is to know about the boy who is way out of his depth playing a hero. He knows Peter is Spider-Man. It is a huge and dangerous secret, to be sure. And Tony Stark would never admit it, but he is kind of 

proud

 he is the one to keep it for Peter. But what he doesnâ€™t know is that Peter Parker has another dangerous secret, and 

that

 secret is bigger than life.


Â 


Aunt May knows Peterâ€™s secret. She isnâ€™t proud of it. She isnâ€™t happy about it. She isnâ€™t even remotely okay with it. Not by a long shot. She could accept the fact that her nephew is a mutant swinging from skyscrapers on his webbing at night. She could even accept him risking his life for total strangers on a daily basis. She could accept all of it, but she doesnâ€™t have to. Because she doesnâ€™t know. What she does know is that her fifteen-year-old nephew is in love with Iron Man. And there is nothing she can do about it.


Two people in the whole world know Peter Parkerâ€™s secret. It just isnâ€™t the same secret.
