Chapter 1: The New Heir of Stark
    




Chapter Text
Mary Parker. That’s a name Tony hadn’t heard in a long time. Even then he knew her when she was Mary Fitzpatrick, bright-eyed girl with dreams of being a civil servant. At first, she was just meant to be a notch on his bed post but they ended up being good friends for a while, she let him get away with too much, humoured his poor behaviour too often, but he had made her laugh and to her that was important. It hadn’t been long into her time with the CIA that she had met Richard, and with her work and obvious love taking up all her time, Tony took a step back not that it bothered him he was always letting himself get distracted. It was years later that she asked something of him. Something that he happily gave up out of respect for their brief but interesting friendship. That favour had just come back to potentially bite him in the ass. “Tony. You’ve just been requested to attend a will reading.”“My parents died years ago Pepper, I don’t know anyone else other than you and Rhodie who would actually leave me stuff when you die. Where is Rhodie anyway?”“He’s at Edward’s Airbase.”“Nothing new there then. Pepper, you deal with it. I’m busy”And with that, Tony went back to his schematics, muttering to J.A.R.V.I.S as he works, with exasperation Pepper stalks out of the room to do her apparent job of being Tony Stark when he was too busy working on weapons or sleeping with someone to deal with the ‘boring things’.   There was a child. On his couch. This. This was new. It also looked upset.  All he had wanted was to come up to get a sandwich to take a break from designing, there shouldn’t be a kid on his couch.Tony hadn’t really ever had to deal with children before, at least not past the occasional press invited hospital visits he had attended when Stark industries had developed something that would help sick children. So Tony opted to do what he would do if it was anyone he didn’t know just sitting on his couch. “Pepper?!”She walked in calmly despite his surprised and confused tone, holding a glass of milk and a plate of his chocolate-chip cookies. “Those are my cookies. Pepper, what is going on, was there a thing that I was meant to do but didn’t. I don’t remember meeting with a children’s group thing being on my schedule.”Pepper ignores him in favour of handing the plate of cookies and milk to the young brown-haired little boy who politely took them, thanking her in a small voice, he took another moment to just look at Tony before eating just as quietly as he spoke. Pepper strokes his hair before coming over to Tony, dragging him a little away from the boy so she could talk to him.“Pepper, why is he eating my cookies?”“Because he asked for them. Remember that thing you said you were too busy for?”Tony blinked at her owlishly.“You’re really going to need to be more specific. There are a lot of things you talk about that I’m generally too busy for. Why is he staring at me like that? Why is there a 4-year-old on my couch?”“Seven and a half. And I’m talking about the will reading, remember that, I told you about it four days ago.”“Really not seeing what that has to do with the kid.”“He’s Mary Parker’s son.”It takes him a second then he just stares at the kid. And just keeps looking at him.“Will reading?”“Of Mary and Richard Parker. Yes.”“Seven?”“And a half, yes.”Tony just turns and walks off, heading down to his workshop and garage, ignoring Pepper as she shouts for him to stop and follows him. Once down there he orders J.A.R.V.I.S to play anything hard rock as he moves from works space to works space, pacing at his cars, ducks both Dum-E and Butterfingers arms then sat down at his computer.Pepper was right on his heels as he fled the living room, trying to get him to stop the whole time. She stood just inside the room and watched him pace and wander from place to place, she stopped her yelling and just watched him before telling J.A.R.V.I.S to turn off the music. “Adopt him out.” He looked determined and only mildly panicked “Why did he even get to me? Richard had a brother.”“Had, Tony. I didn’t ask about it, but something happened shortly before they passed. He has an Aunt May, but right now there’s no way she could look after him on her own right now.”“Right now? So it’s only temporary then?” Tony knew he shouldn’t have looked so hopeful because Pepper shook her head slowly.“You’re named on the birth certificate.”“Mary was a drunk.” Pepper let out an exasperated sigh.“Tony, I might not have been your assistant 7 years ago, but I am now and I know every legal transaction you’ve made, including helping them conceive. He’s legally and biologically yours.”“No” He turns back to his computer and starts typing. Pulling up files trying to find one that he can focus on and lose himself in. Causing Pepper to grab the back of his chair and pulling him away, the panicked look on his face returning.He can’t be a father. Well okay yes, he can be the boy proves it but he’s ta
