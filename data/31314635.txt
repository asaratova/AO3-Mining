Chapter 1: Maternal Instincts
    




Chapter Text
By nature, Natasha never thought herself capable of being maternal. The Red Room raised that instinct out of her - and, as all things, they went that extra mile to eliminate all potential distractions in the form of children by having her sterilized at her graduation.The culmination of her upbringing led Nat to decide early on that she was, without a doubt, in capable of caring for a child.But then she met Clint. And Laura. And a few years after that came Cooper.Sweet, little Cooper who scared Natasha to no end. She’d killed hundreds of people in the past - bargained with the equivalent of earth-side devils - monitored and surveyed potential threats - wielded weapons that left people shaking in fear.And if that wasn’t enough, she’d been captured - starved - beat - interrogated - almost murdered on several occasions. And yet, the only thing that was ever truly frightening to her was a completely helpless 8-pound infant. The infamous Black Widow rendered useless the moment a squirming bundle was forced into her arms by her best friends who swore up and down that she wouldn't break him. It was truly a sight to see. But even as she grew to love the boy and care for him as any good aunt would, she would still admit that Cooper never triggered that maternal instinct in her.Lila almost opened that flood gate, though. She was tinier than Cooper was. Even more useless and incapable of keeping herself alive. And Natasha felt a vigorous amount of protection for the little one. She wanted to keep her nephew and niece safe from all harm and it felt almost natural.Even maternal.But Nat knew that wasn’t entirely the case since she’d already set the reminder in her own head that those wonderful kids weren’t her’s to mother. They already had Laura - an amazing mom who wasn’t in need of replacing. One who certainly had no short-comings that required Nat to step in and fill. No, Nat was there purely as an aunt figure. Nothing more. Nothing less.Nothing maternal.But then there was Wanda. Tiny, Wanda who had all this scary power jammed into her defenceless body.Wanda who was used as a weapon against the Avengers. Who proved that she was the such a powerful force to be reckoned with, even at such a young age.Nat swore nothing would come of that situation. The goal was to defeat Ultron, get the kids away from his clutches, and hopefully restore Sokovia to a state where Wanda and Pietro could be returned to their family - one they would soon find out were eliminated in HYDRA's effort to steal away the twins. None of those plans came into fruition. The Avengers were fighting a losing battle against a highly advance AI. The kids were constantly being torn from their grasp by Ultron's endless supply of links. And Sokovia was further and further away from any point of restoration.They thought it was over. But then Pietro got caught in the cross-fire. He was only four. He didn’t know any better. But Ultron was threatening Wanda and he was always the protective older brother. So he stepped in and he didn’t survive. Leaving little, four-year-old Wanda all by herself. She, of course, sent all of her emotion outward in a wave of red that did in one second what the Avengers had been struggling to do for several days. She destroyed Ultron and all his links. But that wasn’t enough.She was shattered. In consolable. Scared. Lost. And it was in the midst of hearing her wails that Nat felt that tingle of maternal instinct start - though she didn’t know it then. In that moment she thought it was sympathy. All she knew was that there was a little girl - younger than her niece and nephew back home - who wasn’t able to ever catch a break.A little girl who needed a home since her own plummeted several miles back to earth in a firey ball of destruction. One who needed a family since she’d lost her parents as a newborn and then her brother right before her eyes.And Nat decided that, for the time being, her space could be home enough for Wanda. It was only supposed to be temporary. Long enough for Pepper to sort out the legalities and for the team to conclude how they intended to handle what appeared to be the most powerful person in all of existence. A person who had no control over said power and could very easily fall back into the wrong hands.Wanda stayed with Nat for what was initially intended to be two weeks. The little one shared her bed. A small supply of clothes was ordered to the tower for her. And the team slowly spoiled Wanda with toys to help the child pass the time.It was just enough for the girl to be comfortable in her temporary stay.But two weeks turned into a month. Turned into two. Then three. Then six.Nat was offered relief on several occassions - Tony had pinpointed some safe places for Wanda to be sent/raised. But every time Wanda slipped her tiny hand into Nat’s, and every night that little body cuddled against her own, she found herself resisting Tony’s offers.None of them ever s
