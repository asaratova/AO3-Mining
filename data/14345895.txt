Chapter 1: Happy Hogan
    




Chapter Text
Happy led Peter Parker out of the school. It's been a long time since he's return to this side of town and yet, he remembered exactly where to park and find the kid. Seeing Peter, amongst his peers, threw Happy back to the times when the kid was just a kid, trying to squeeze his way into Tony's world. And now that he got through, it saddened Happy that the kid couldn't go back. 
If only they did better.
They passed a highly decorated locker. Peter slowed down, lingering a minute to take in the make-shift shrine of whoever that locker belonged to. Peter gazed at it for a few seconds until Happy tugged on him to continue.
"You know the kid or something?" Happy asked. 
Peter quizzically furrowed his brows. "It's my locker, Happy," he said. "My old one, at least."
Happy took another look. It was then he noticed the spider-man themes, the notes left for Peter and the Fuck Accords signs. "Oh."
"I don't know how I feel about it," Peter confessed, taking one last peak over his shoulder. "Makes me feel... like I'm dead."
"Well, you're not," Happy proudly stated. He was thankful the kid survived the nightmare Ross created. "And we really need to hurry."
They exited the school building. The white, morning glare struck them hard across the face. Happy dropped his chin, looking at the cemented stairs as he headed in the direction of the car. "Hood up, kid," he advised, remembering the precautions Peter needed to take.
Peter flipped his hood over his head, barely concealing his face. They hurried down the steps, arriving close to the car when Happy heard a sharp gasp from his left.
Both Happy and Peter turned to the noise. A woman, with her young child, was rooted to the sidewalk. Her eyes were round and eager and wonder. The little one, a boy, stood right beside his mother, hand in hers. He didn't have a reaction at all. Kept looking up at them and then to his shocked mother. 
"You're... you're..." the mother struggled to find her words through the shock. "Oh my god! You're Peter Parker!"
The little boy reacted. He sucked in a gasp, eyes just as round as his mother's, peering right up into Parker's face. Peter stiffened, unsure what to do in the scenario as to whether confirm or deny it. 
Happy knew what to do. He protectively grabbed Peter, ready to put himself between Peter and the mother. Not that he believed she would attack him, but it was out of habit for guarding Tony for so many years. 
Yet, the mother beat him. She didn't grab Peter or shout at him. She did nothing like what most of Tony's fans did. Instead, she whipped out her phone. "Can you please take a photo with my son?" she asked, her hand a bit shaky. "He's a huge fan!"
Happy felt Peter hesitate. "Um... sure."
"Kid—" Happy began to dissuade him, ready to remind him that Tony didn't want him to be recognized yet.
"It's okay, Happy," Peter assured, stepping out of Happy's protective circle and went to the mother.
Happy groaned softly. Why did his clients always insist on a bodyguard if they were never going to utilize their protective services? It annoyed him. 
Peter squatted in front of the boy, smiling. "Hey, little man," he said. "What's your name?"
The boy was still. His mouth flopped open and eyes glued on Peter's face in stunned disbelief. The mother tried to get her son to respond, but ended up answering on his behalf. "His name is Mateo," she said to Peter. "And I swear, he's usually chatty."
"It's okay," Peter said and turned back to Mateo, the boy. "Hi, Mateo! I'm Peter. Your mom wants us to take a picture together. You want that?"
The boy finally moved. He slowly nodded his head. 
"Great," Peter said and soon enough, the boy was in Peter's arms, listening to the mother's instructions to get the best lightening for her camera. 
Happy sunk against the car, watching it with exaggerated annoyance. The boy couldn't stop looking at Peter. No matter how many times his mother called for him to look at her for the picture, the kid never turned his head away from Peter. Eventually, the mother gave up and took two, quick photographs of Peter and Mateo. One of Peter smiling and the other of Peter helping Mateo reenact his Spider-man webbing pose. 
The mother was so thankful when Peter returned her child to her. "Thank you!" she told Peter. "We are so happy for you to be here again. Everyone in Queens supports you. You're a hero."
Peter's cheeks reddened. "Thank you."
Happy tapped on the car door, garnering Peter's attention. "Come on, kid," he said. "We gotta go."
Peter said his goodbyes and went to the car. Happy closed the car door and turned to the mother and child, who still hadn't left the steps of Midtown yet. "Hey, listen," Happy addressed her, causing the mother to flinch in surprise that he was talking to her. "You can't upload those photos. Not yet. Wait for later on in the day, okay?"
The mother was surprised. "What? Why?"  
"Because no one is supposed to know he's here."
The mother understood. "All ri
