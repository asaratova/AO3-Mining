NATASHA:
Training with the new recruits is always taxing, some of them being years younger than you.  Though you outweighed them in skill, their stamina was insane.  Everything was worth it, though, when you could look up from pinning one of the over confident little shits and see your wife staring at you in the way that you knew you’d be getting rewarded later. You’re getting dressed in the locker room when strong, yet lithe arms wrap around your waist and you find yourself smiling.“You did good, today,”  Natasha whispers, her lips grazing over your neck.  In a flash, you’ve spun her around and pinned her against the lockers.  She had been gone for 3 weeks on a mission and you had fucking missed her.  Besides, you had a surprise for her.“Less talk, and less clothes.”  You growl, all but shoving your hand down her pants.  She mewls against you, tearing at your clothes and not giving a damn if anyone walks in on the two of you.Her soft hands push under your shirt, grazing over the hard muscles of your abdominals as she pushes the offending material off of your body.  She makes quick work of your sports bra after that, and when your naked chest stares back at her, she freezes.She’s reaching out before she can stop herself, cupping your breast as she looks up at you quizzically with lust dancing in the depths of her eyes.“Did you do this for me?”  She asks, a smile dancing across her lips.  You gift her with your own smile before descending on her own naked breasts.“What do you think?”  Silence settles for a few seconds as you taste her.  “Do you like it?”“What do you think?”  She asks, then proceeds to show you just how much she does like it.



WANDA:
Laughter rings out through the room and you lean into Wanda’s side, smiling from the joke that Sam has just cracked.  The whole team is lounged around the living room after a rather long day, boozing, and sharing a few laughs.  There’s a flitting heat around your chest for the better part of the night, but you’ve brushed it off - adding it up to the alcohol running through your veins and the proximity of your girlfriend. You glance at her every so often, trying to think of anything except the new piercing lying beneath your bra.  You supposed she’d find out sooner or later, but the way she lets you know that she has? Well, that’s what’s problematic.You stand, pressing a kiss to her head that she grins at, then motion to the room.  You collect the trash around you, stepping over outstretched legs all around.“I’m going for another beer, anybody want o-” A gasp rattles through you, a shiver dancing down your spine as something brushes against your nipple and the cold metal there.  Ok, that was strange.You look to the others lingering on Wanda, your brow furrowed low in question but she looks back with the same look on her own face.  Maybe you were imagining it...You shake your head, continuing to the kitchen and dropping the empty bottles in the trash.It’s when you’re leaning over in the fridge when you feel it again, one of the new bottles slipping easily from your fingers.  Heads shoot in your direction when the glass shatters at your feet, but you don’t care.  You’re too distracted by the way your piercing is practically vibrating against your nipple before it’s being tugged lightly by...something.  You bite your lip, bracing yourself against the island counter, not even giving a shit if Sam and Steve think that you’ve lost your damn mind.  You look up and are met with a smirk.  And then you know exactly what’s going on. You have to battle a moan back down when you look up, your eyes meeting mischevious green ones.Perched ever so daintily on the love seat, Wanda is waving her fingers through the air, occasionally bringing them to a pinching motion.  She simply cocks her head as she continues her ministrations, and sends you a wink. 


 

THOR:
Ice blues eyes bore into your from across the room and you know you’re in for it.  You and Thor had been teasing each other for a few weeks now, nothing serious, but tonight sent him diving over the edge.You walked into one of Tony’s parties dressed to the damn nines...sans bra.  The dress really didn’t need one, but the way the material brushed against you really made you wish you had worn one.  You had to keep your arms crossed tight across your chest lest anyone see the way you were practically poking through.  It was cold, and the silky material of your dress did nothing to hide your breasts or the metal that ran through your right nipple.But Thor had noticed.  Of course he noticed!  His eyes were always one you and god, it was unnerving.  He was a God, for crying out loud.  He was absolutely flawless and to think that someone who looked like him could desire someone like you was just...wow.He's staring you down as you have some kind of conversation with Rhodey - who knew what he was talking about, you were distracted beyond belief.Thor is standing next to Tony and Sam, both men oblivious to that way he's
