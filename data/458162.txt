One day, Bruce opened the door to his apartment in Queens and Steve was standing there, a square wooden board under one arm and a worn cardboard box in his other hand.“Chess,” said Bruce.“Hi Doctor Banner,” said Steve.“Hey,” said Bruce, and let him in.“How are you doing?” said Steve.“Okay,” said Bruce.  “How was church?”“Good.” Steve put the board and box on the card table.  “You do play, right?”Bruce’s thumb ran over his fingers.  “I know how,” he said finally.“I thought since you didn’t have a TV,” Steve said, opening the box.Bruce had been in New York City almost two months, and Steve had been coming over every Sunday after church for about half of that time.  When they had lived in Uganda, Steve had visited fairly frequently.  At first, Bruce had thought it was because Steve had questions or wanted help, but eventually he’d figured out that Steve really liked other people’s company.  It was the typical difference between an extrovert and introvert: Steve gained energy from being around other people; Bruce found being around other people exhausting.It had taken an embarrassingly long time to remember that fact in New York, after several phone calls that left Bruce wondering why Steve wanted to spend time together so often.  It had taken an even longer time to realize that Steve didn’t have that many friends here.  Bruce felt like he probably should have known that, once he realized it, but it hadn’t occurred to him that Steve considered him a friend.  It took even longer for it to occur to Bruce that Steve considered him among the best of them.Steve was setting up the chess pieces while Bruce got the coffee going in the kitchen.  “I used to play with Bucky,” Steve said.“Was he any good?” Bruce asked, because Steve liked to talk about Bucky.“Nope,” said Steve.  “He pretty much lost horribly every single time.”“Just so you know, I’m pretty much going to lose horribly.”  The water was on the stove, and Bruce had measured out the grounds, so he came back to the living room area and sat across from Steve.  “I didn’t know you played.”Steve smiled at him.  “When you’re no good at ball, you do plenty of nerdy things to stay entertained.  Anyway,” he said, “geniuses are supposed to be good at chess.  What’s wrong with you?”Rolling his eyes, Bruce pushed a pawn.  “I’m sorry I’m not a master of strategy.”“I’m not a master of strategy.”  Steve pushed his own pawn.“You sell yourself short,” Bruce said, and moved his knight.Steve looked at him, then looked down.  His strong hand should probably have looked too large and beefy moving over the board, but instead he made each move look elegant, the flick of his wrist moving through the tendon up bare, strong arms.  “Speaking of nerdy things,” Steve said.Bruce focused on the board again, and moved his bishop.  “It’s going alright.”“Oh?” Steve moved his knight.Shooting Steve a look, Bruce said, “He’s been surprisingly . . . patient.”Steve smiled, a line showing up at the side of his mouth.  “I was talking about the college.”“Oh.  That’s going alright too.”  Bruce had been doing some lab work at City College so he could pay the bills.  They’d offered him a guest professorship for the summer term.He’d also been working with Tony in a lab in Stark Tower off and on for around five weeks.  They were trying to build a more economically efficient toilet for use in third world countries, because among all of Tony’s projects, it was the only one Bruce couldn’t see being used as a weapon.“I’ve never known Mister Stark to be patient,” Steve said.  They exchanged moves again, and Bruce castled.  Steve looked at him, blue eyes quick and too perceptive, then back down at the board.  He moved another pawn.  “Do you think it’s because of what happened last time?”“You mean he thinks I’m going to turn tail and run?”“Are you?”Bruce moved his other bishop again.  “I don’t know, Steve.  So far, we’re okay.  I mean, we’re designing a toilet, not mind control.”Steve pushed another pawn up to attack the bishop.  “Was there a possibility of developing mind control?”“Tony was working on technology powered by the Tesseract when I got back.”  Bruce moved his bishop back.  “It’s why I came.”“I would have thought that would make you run in the other direction.”Bruce smiled ruefully.  “Then you don’t know me very well.”Another flash of blue eyes, and Steve’s long blond lashes.  “I know you’re not a fan of doing anything that will hurt people,” he said quietly, pushing another pawn to attack.“I’m not.”  Bruce moved his bishop back again.  “Knowing Tony, he thinks I’m some kind of wild animal he just has to lure out into the open.”“You think he’s trying to trap you?”“More like tame me.  Once I see how harmless building toilets is, I’m going to think it’s grand and dandy to build Iron Man suits and—whatever other dangerous thing Tony is working on these days.”Steve smiled crookedly, the corner of his mouth turning down in a teasing way.  “I suppose green energy is very dangero
