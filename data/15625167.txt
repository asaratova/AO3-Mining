Chapter Text
pan with a plan @hotnmessy
y’all tony stark himself could tell me he’s not pan and i still wouldn’t believe himis you blind @messynhot
honestly that’s a big moodSpooky @FunkItUp
you guys are gross. he’s a playboy and has never once been with a guy. he’s straight.pan with a plan @hotnmessy
lmao i didn’t ask, but go off i guess-that is not correct @bcaccording
so if about 1 of every 10 people is queer, who is it in the avengers??? there’s gotta be at least 2, realistically.but still good @lessbien
i’m hoping it’s black widow, i would love for her to choke me with her thighsthat is not correct @bcaccording
i know i’m op, but that’s a mood. also according to norse mythology, gender and sexuality didn’t matter to asgardians, so thor??? what’s up???bi babe @bibabe
dude, what if cap was queer? the uproar would be amazingbut still good @lessbien
cap’s childhood friend more than just a friend? highly likely in my book.that is not correct @bcaccording
plot twist: they’re all gay and the whole world is on an episode of punkedbi babe @bibabe
titties: out
third eye: open
theory: accepted-eugene @ayybaby
with how little we know about the avengers personally, any one of them could be transrainbow pants @knope4prez
holy shit you’re righteugene @ayybaby
like, the public didn’t even know that tony stark existed until he was 15 and going to mit. ppl assumed it was because of some shameful thing, but what if he’s just trans???rainbow pants @knope4prez
dude you’re so right. holy shit.eugene @ayybaby
any super who’s name ends with man or woman is trans. sorry, i don’t make the rules.-Plant King @PlantKing
i would personally like to thank the avengers for not being publically problematic. as far as we know, you guys are awesome.mitochondria @powerhouse
seriously, all they do is save the world and get shawarma. tony stark used to be kinda ehh, but then he stopped making weapons and become iron man.bi babe @bibabe
captain america is from the 40s and we have yet to see him do even one questionable thing.that is not correct @bcaccording
captain america still looks so good at nearly 100 because he’s not problematic. he’s like andy samberg.but still good @lessbien
holy shit i just realized that black widow is practically rosa diez. black widow is a bi icon confirmed.
