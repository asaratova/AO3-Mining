Prologue:

A Very Harry Happening
“Please tell me I’m actually dead this time.”Harry’s voice came out in a deadpan as he opened his eyes in an all-too-familiar location.He hadn’t been back to Platform 9 ¾ since leaving for his final (eighth) year of Hogwarts.There was no need, as he had neither friends at the ancient school nor any children to send off.  Though he supposed Teddy was almost there, but it wasn’t yet September and that nightmare of first-year anxiety was months away.  Andromeda would handle most of it, as she’d done with the rest of the day-to-day of raising his godson/her grandson.  But Harry would still be the one the young Lupin would lean on for those first-day jitters.Well.He would have been.But being a Hit Wizard wasn’t exactly all sunshine and roses, and Harry had already beaten the odds more than once.Moreover, he’d recognized that sickly-purple spell the newest wave of wizarding-cult-followers had shot at him.  Hell.  He’d used the Sectumsempra more than once in the line of duty.He’d felt it hit across his upper chest and neck.He’d felt himself get cold and his vision – finally corrected after reaching his majority and being able to request and pay for the expensive potion – fade out.Harry had died.Again.Though maybe this time it would take, even if it would leave behind a grieving Teddy.Harry didn’t try and fool himself.After he’d thrown off everyone’s expectations, taking up his seats in the Wizengamot and going after his Inheritance that everyone had somehow neglected to mention *cough, Dumbledore, cough, Weasleys, cough*, not many people would miss him other than his godson.He imagined that even Andromeda, stern matriarch that she was, would only miss having his support and more importantly his name to throw around, more than him himself.No.Going back to Hogwarts, not what the Ministry wanted or the public expected, but still within the “allowable” realm of behavior.Accepting all his vaults, his titles, and his responsibilities, well, it wasn’t what anyone wanted for him, per se, but it wasn’t beyond the pale either.It was when he entered Hit Wizard training instead of Auror Academy that people started to twitch.Harry was already considered volatile, powerful, and somewhat dangerous.Joining the ranks of witches and wizards who were the Wizarding World’s version of Special Forces crossed with MI6…that started up a tone of concern, though it was levied in part that as a Hit Wizard he was ostensibly under the aegis of the Ministry and all-was-still-well.It was also the first real strike against the tidy “plan” that had been set in motion for his life, ever since he was born and likely before he was even conceived.The Wizarding World liked things neat and tidy in their little labeled boxes.Potters were Aurors.Malfoys were Politicians.Blacks were eccentric (or flat-out crazy) Nobles.And so on, into infinity.But Harry bucked centuries of tradition and went into the more dangerous field of being a Hit Wizard, which carried with it a ten-year expiration date: either you died before then (which was ninety percent of them) or you retired and either taught the oncoming young-bloods or transferred into the DMLE either as an administrator of some kind or as an Auror.Harry’s ten-year mark was coming up soon, and he’d made it despite curses, hexes, vampires (and wasn’t that a fun case…) and now this new muggleborn-driven cult that wanted, irony of ironies, to tear down the Statute of Secrecy and usher in a world where wizard kind were benign rulers.This shit just never ended.It simply changed faces.He could almost hear Tom laughing from the gates of Hell where he was no doubt waiting for Harry to show up.Harry had no illusions about himself.  Not anymore.  He might’ve made a middling-to-good godfather when he wasn’t dodging curses or blood-sucking-fiends, but he also killed his first man at the age of eleven and thereafter never really…stopped.Oh, there were lulls, and sometimes it was creatures that he ended up ending instead of people, but it was as if once his heart got a taste of death it never forgot it – or how easy it was to dole it out.He had a survival instinct that was, even he could admit, second to none, surviving things that would have killed anyone else.And this time that survival instinct was screaming at him that he’d finally failed to listen to it in time.Most of all…Harry was just tired.Not so much of his job, he’d been damn good as a Hit Wizard, nor of his role as godfather though he was glad that he’d got to at least spend the last ten years with Teddy.But tired, oh yes, he was tired of other things.Tired of the expe
