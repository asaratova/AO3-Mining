Summary:

Hathor decides to visit an old friend





Chapter Text
“Your mother's friends are mistaken”Hathor told Anubis, once the gods returned to the Overvoid.“The companions of the great Nephthys are also yours, my beautiful lady” the God with the head of a jackal reminded the Goddess “And, perhaps I should also remind you that it’s your Konshu who, knowing the rules, on purpose sought that punishment, in which you once again participated”Hathor crossed her arms watching the stars dance in the Overvoid.Anubis, wasn’t part of the Ennead.Long before any of the other gods, he had left the human Earth, to dedicate himself, in his words, to other universes. Some in which faith was not yet so corrupted, where the divine presence was still possible. Where the hand of the other gods wasn’t present.From the Overvoid he observed and intervened, then, in his Galaxy, far, far away, through all its conflicts, in an eternal process of creation and confrontation, since the God maintained that it was in this process of perfection, where reside the main reason behind his fascination and to which was added the little attention that the other gods gave to his work.In his Galaxy, Anubis could be as free as Konshu was on Earth.“He’s right, doesn’t?” asked the God approaching the Goddess “She… has found her champion”“Konshu can be many things, son of Nephthys, but never an alarmist... my avatar has judged that his words are true”“And Khonshu’s champion? Who’s his avatar?”The goddess drew with her hands the figure of the human who had spoken with Yatzil and, from the air itself, the lines of Marc Spector were conjured.“Interesting” Anubis proclaimed crossing his arms as he turned around the image on the golden decorations of his creation chamber “It's a… daring choice for champion, however being Konshu, I don't think I should be surprised, right?“He's a man with problems” Hathor expressed annoyed “More than daring, the choice is…”“All great champions have complicated stories, ma'am” Anubis interrupted her “This man is not too different from those whom I have chosen to be my avatar in the past. It just seems bold to me because... Konshu doesn't have time to mold his champion to his liking and pleasure”“If you ask me” admitted the Goddess “I think that Konshu was forced by circumstances to choose this avatar”“Doesn't that seem too benevolent, ma'am? Don't you think that our God of the Moon only wanted to return to walking among humans in possession of a body that would allow him to circumvent the decision of the great Osiris that forbids possessing bodies in that world?” questioned the God with a smile “After all, most of us can admit without blushing that there’s nothing more exhilarating, outside the chaos of power, than stepping on the desert sand with human feet, drinking its delicate nectars with human lips or waking in human arms. Pleasure, it’s pleasure. We have all succumbed at some point. And our divine friend, has been very lonely on Earth, for too long. The fragmented mind of this man is a good driver for such a possession. It wouldn’t allow to leave no traces or...memories, which could be used in a judgment against Khonshu”Hathor snorted.It was true.Marc or Steven, they were just two of several fragments within the same body. A complex story. But perfect if seen through the eyes of a exile like Konshu.How could the gods prove that their banished brother was taking a detour to the rule of Osiris? With what testimony if the same human wouldn’t remember it?It was horrendous, but, at the same time, understandable.And, as Anubis had said, they had all succumbed to temptation. None of the gods had been spared using their avatars or other willing bodies. The curiosity and intimacy that these experiences provided had led them to give into the desire so regularly that Osiris had put an end to such interactions by banning it and installing the rule of avatars in its place.The gods hadn't taken it too well, but, as always, they had obeyed.Except for the moon. Whom the humans continued to adore, as if feeling the presence of the god who had decided to continue by their side, the silence and the distance that the other gods imposed as a result of this rule, caused the human beings to relegate them until the deities only became sighs from beyond.Konshu was right: the gods had abandoned humanity, while he had decided to risk everything by staying by their side.Relegating his immortal life to surrender it to the service of others.“I…” whispered the goddess stretching out her hand to caress the cheek of the image of the human “I can only see solitude and silence anchored in despair, Anubis. Konshu… is not infallible and is… too much like the humans he protects. Could you blame him for circumventing such a strict rule in his situation? Haven't all of us broken a rule of Osiris at some time? Especially that one”The jackal-headed god burst out laughing and dispelled with one of his hands the image that the god
