Chapter 1: King of Corruption
    




Chapter Text
“Mr. Stark!  Mr. Stark, please, I’m Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.  I just need five minutes.”Tony paused, his back to the voice, ready to duck inside the limo to escape the crowd outside the conference hall.  But still, it was a pretty sexy voice.“What do we got?” Tony asked quietly.“A good seven, sir,” Happy said, expressionless.Tony turned around and smiled at the leggy blonde.  “Sure, I got five.  Fire away.”“Do you like your name, ‘Toymaker?’”Tony smiled back at the chirpy Christine’s question.  To answer questions like that, from a woman who was bold enough to approach him coming out of an adult entertainment conference, was always worth a smile.  Even for reporters fishing for a scoop when he was just about to leave.“I’m always fond of nicknames.  That one’s pretty cute, actually.”“And what about your other nickname, the ‘King of Corruption?’” Christine said, dropping her megawatt smile for a more serious reporter’s tone.Happy almost smiled when he saw Tony’s back tense.  The poor woman had no idea of the button she’d just pushed.  “Corruption?  Lady, my father spent his life making guns and bombs so people could kill each other more efficiently.  He worked on the Manhattan project helping make one of the most devastating weapons on the face of the Earth.  And that’s not what I want to leave behind, that’s not what I want for my legacy.  If I’d followed in my father’s footsteps, I wouldn’t just have some conservative groups picketing my building, I’d have blood on my hands, hundreds or thousands of widows and orphans left behind by what I’d made, groups who’d put a price on my head, and people probably calling me the ‘Merchant of Death.’  I don’t want that.  I never wanted that.  I’d rather give people orgasms than bullet wounds.”  Tony turned and flashed his trademark smile at the crowd a little distance behind her.  “Make love, not war!”The crowd went berserk at Tony’s slogan, and Christine Everhart rolled her eyes.“You don’t feel you’re squandering your genius?  The programs used for your… Long Distance Lover machines could have countless applications for communications systems or targeting programs, not to mention the energy potential in your patented power source.”“Always annoying when you’re right on the cusp of something amazing and the batteries give out, eh?  Oh no, I’m sure anyone in the armed forces would be too embarrassed to power so much as a coffee maker with the same thing that runs the Lothario 5000-series pistoning dildos.”“I think you underestimate the capacity for folks in the military to use whatever they have to do get their jobs done.”“Oh no, I never underestimate them in that capacity,” Tony said blandly, letting a little more steel creep into his voice.  Ms. Everhart abruptly changed her tactics, trying to shock him.“Is there any truth to the rumors you model some of your products on your own genitals?” she asked.“The Naked Lust line, yup, they’re direct made from direct casts of my cock, sized up or down according to people’s preferences,” he said without shame.  That rocked her for a second, and he leaned forward to press his advantage.  “Want to come by the house and see which one measures up to the real deal?”She gaped at him, momentarily lost for words, and Tony turned away.“Actually, I’m busy tonight, but I’ll give you the next best thing.  Happy, give Ms. Everhart here one of me, would you?”Tony ducked into the comfort of his limo as Happy pressed a cheerfully lewd box into her hands that proudly proclaimed it was the Star model of the Naked Lust dildo family.  The expression on her face as Happy drove away was more than worth that whole confrontation.--“JARVIS?”“Welcome home, sir.”“I’ve had a rough night, buddy.”  Tony rolled his neck a little to loosen the tightness in his shoulders and began to strip.“Would you care for it rough then, sir?” JARVIS asked diffidently.  “Ms. Everhart was rather insistent.”“Made YouTube, did we?”JARVIS flicked open a file on a nearby screen, showing someone’s slightly-shaky recording of Tony’s speech from their phone.“Brilliant,” Tony said flatly.  “And no, not rough.  I just need to clear my head.”“As you will, sir.”Tony tossed the last of his clothes in the corner and bent over the workbench, nipples peaking from the cool surface.  He reached behind himself and slowly worked the bright red butt plug out of his ass (the self-lubricating Iron Rod, one of his best sellers), and tossed it into the sterilizer before bracing himself.“Care for a view, sir?”“Always,” Tony said, and smiled a bit as JARVIS activated the camera on his own, personal Long Distance Lover.  It was the crown jewel of StarkNaked Industries’ products, a mobile fucking machine with a camera and remote controls, so loving spouses and significant others could give their loved ones some fun even when out of town.  Though the statistical analysis was still not certain, Tony anecdotally heard that divorce rates had dro
