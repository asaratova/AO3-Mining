The Veil was an anomaly located within the Department of Mysteries. There had been many curiosities regarding magic studied in that location but none had been more mystifying then the Veil. There was something about it that drew people to it. For years, it was used by the Ministry to send prisoners who had done horrific things to a place where they would suffer a fate worse than death.Then the Ministry made a deal with the Dementors and the Veil forgotten about.Harry Potter was another mystery that had defied all explanation.Harry Potter stepped through the Veil.The essence of magic flowed through Harry Potter in that world and followed him out of it. After the events of Halloween 1981, Albus Dumbledore stated foolishly that the Magical World owed a debt of gratitude to Harry Potter. The Ministry agreed, even though it was a politically motivated maneuver to get them into the good graces of the general public. They would put their wagon behind this young hero and reaped the benefits.The moment the Wizarding World failed Harry Potter, that debt caused the lives of every man, woman, and child to be in peril. They forfeited any freedom that they would have.Some lost their powers, others perished, and for some, it was like they never existed. They were erased from the vast tapestry of the multiverse.Harry Potter stepped through the veil and the pouring of magical energy swirled around them like a vortex. Said Vortex caused reality as it was known to be rewritten, lives to be changed, and twisted all around until they were recognizable.Lord Voldemort clung onto life, he refused to be defeated by his own mortality. He refused to lose this easily. His body burned down to its very atoms as his essence was torn cleanly from it.Sirius Black was the first to go through the Veil. A physical body was never sent through, rather a ritual was sent to banish their souls through the veil whilst the physical body was burned as a symbol, but be that as it may, Sirius Black's body went through the veil. His soul ripped from it whilst it floated aimlessly in the void and his body was left in a state of flux.Harry Potter followed him, the moment he stepped through, the debt that Dumbledore and the Ministry claimed that they owed him was called into question. As a result the world became unraveled, it was no longer the same.The second Harry Potter passed through the veil, a soul was torn from his body. However, the powers that be were not particular about whose soul was torn from his body. The soul fragment of Tom Marvolo Riddle was ripped from his being and floated aimlessly. Harry's body drifted in stasis for what seemed like an eternity and given the nature of time and space passing through this Phantom Zone, it might as well have been. Then somehow he escaped through a backdoor that had been set up by his bloodline.The Phantom Zone was a place that no prisoner had ever escaped but Harry Potter always defied expectations.Once he found a way to get out of this room, it had been secured with a powerful seal that he could not break. And then after he killed Potter, and his friends he would find out where here was.The Dark Lord found his way out of the Phantom Zone through a weakened body that was strengthened over time through Potter's foolishly noble efforts to revive his godfather. Little did he know that there were three things that went through the Veil that day.As for Sirius Black's soul, he was forever lost in an endless void, it's fate undetermined. Lord Voldemort suspected that this soul fragment was consumed by the Phantom Wraiths. The Phantom Zone was a worse fate than twelve years under the tender loving care of the Dementors of Azkaban.Despite the fact that this body was inadequate, Voldemort summarized that this was better than the alternative. He remained asleep, in this place, until the moment where Harry Potter would return and he would finish the job he started on Halloween Night of 1981.Then he would slaughter all of Potter's friends because that's what he did.Once he found a way to get out of this room as well, it had been secured with a powerful seal that he could not break. And where he found out where here was.

All was quiet in the Xavier Institute, the X-Men were known to the news media where they had been mere myths a few weeks ago. It was only a small relief that none of the names could be attached to the faces. Only time would tell whether or not they would be outed even further to the public but the Friends of Humanity membership swelled over the past couple of weeks.A young woman with a hood pulled over her head made her way to the Xavier Institute. She was dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt and jeans. The woman phased through the fron
