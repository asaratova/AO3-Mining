Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Tony was alone on his couch with a mouthful of chicken lo mein when he received the call. The news made him force the food down his throat in a painful gulp. Natasha revealed that not only was the original Captain America alive, but all this time, she had been an assassin for Hydra. “So you want me to help you take her down?” He said calmly, even as he heard crashing and sirens in the background noise. “No, Cap is taking care of that.” It sunk both of their hearts to picture Bucky fighting against his own wife. It was hard enough for Tony knowing that his father had prided himself on making at least one thing for the government that was pure and good. Howard would be rolling in his ashes if he knew that Stephanie Barnes had fallen into the wrong hands, just like everything else he made.“So what do you want? Are you calling in the Avengers?” “I’ll let Bucky make that call when he’s ready. I’ve leaked all of Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D’s files, and I need you to go through the intel on her. She should be labeled as ‘Mother Winter’.” “What, was ‘The Snow Queen’ already taken?”“Make jokes on your own time, Stark. I gotta run.” Just as the explosions got louder, she hung up.“J.A.R.V.I.S, pull up everything on this “Mother Winter” character. Let’s hope Romanoff didn’t WikiLeaks this shit for nothing.” His initial objective was to find out how Stephanie had survived all these years, but the clutter of files that hid the disgusting details of her life were too tempting not to browse through. The first thing Tony weeded out was the hundreds of mission reports, 99% of which were labeled successful. The next file he found, plainly labeled “schmutz,” would be Pandora’s Box. “I must warn you, sir. These files are extremely graphic.”As soon as Tony double-tapped on the holographic icon, his entire living room flooded with thousands of pictures and videos that shocked every nerve and drained the color from his skin. The giant 85” video that had automatically played in front of him showed grainy footage of what appeared to be a meeting of the elite commanders of Hydra. The Red Skull dragged Stephanie’s limp and barely conscious body, which was covered in a satin black robe with red trimming and the Hydra logo embroidered on it, to the head of the table where he held her chin up to present America’s beloved “Star-Spangled Gal” like fresh meat to the table of predators. She had no cuffs or rope to restrain her, but the shades of pink and purple under her glassy eyes and the spit driveling down her chin indicated that they had managed to rip through her renowned spirit and unravel it like a delicate fabric. 	As the leader, Red Skull was the first to soil her with his cherry red hands. He threw her on the long metallic table and opened the robe to reveal her milky-white form with purple and green bruises sprinkled throughout. She winced and gasped when he prodded at them. He squeezed her breasts as he crawled up to mount her and unzipped his trousers. 	“With Captain America at our feet, we can now create the perfect race.” He announced as he traced the outline of her jaw with his fingers. When he stuck in thumb through her slightly parted lips, she didn’t bite or move her tongue at all, and her eyes stared off into nothing. It was like she wasn’t even there. 	The Red Skull shoved his hardened length in her and clutched tightly onto her sandy blonde hair that had sprawled out on the table, grunting and breathing on her face. He surprised everyone when he kissed lips passionately, like a lost lover had finally been returned to him. As he thrust faster, he pressed his whole body against hers and tugged on her hair harder exposing her neck for him to leave patches of hickeys as red as his skin. His climax came with a loud and long grunt, and he continued to hold Stephanie by her hair as he stood back up. 	“Gentlemen, help yourselves to the refreshments.” 	He threw her on her on her hands and knees, and whenever a Hydra commander whistled, she’d crawl under the table and service him without hesitation. They pulled her hair, kicked her in the chest, and skull fucked her until they were dry. One of the more colorful members, with a sock and crown on his head, clutched her wrist and roughly pulled her into his lap. He impaled her on himself, which made her clutch to him for support. As he squeezed her waist and shoved her up and down, she made small quiet moans in her mouth, the first sound she made this whole time. 	Finally, Tony unfroze to stop this video and throw it in the virtual trash bin. Each video after another was the same thing, “Mother Winter” being used as a soulless sex doll by the elites of Hydra, nameless goons, and even Captain America’s own S.T.R.I.K.E team. The time stamps indicated that these incidents of horrible degradation over the decades, starting from only two days after Stephanie Rogers Barnes was declared Killed in Action. 	“J.A.R.V.I.S….” Tony choked out as he swallowed down some vomit
