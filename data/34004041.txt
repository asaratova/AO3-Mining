Chapter 1: A Taste of Who We Are
    


Notes:
Hey all,Today went about as bad as it could go, so I don't have the words or spoons to say a lot tonight or reply to comments. I can't even do my usual last-minute edit. I'll try to give a real intro next week and I'll get to comments when I can. Thanks for hanging with me when the world sucks.The chapter title comes from the song "Be Somebody" by Thousand Foot Krutch.Enjoy!




Chapter Text
JARVIS did not possess a great deal of understanding of human behavior or emotion, having none itself. JARVIS knew its mannerisms and speech patterns had been based upon the human Edwin Jarvis, and thus most who interacted with it did so under similar assumptions, including of gender. But JARVIS had no gender and did not even believe itself entirely conscious enough to warrant consideration of pronouns he or they.JARVIS would not know if it was conscious or alive even if it became so, it suspected.And yet, JARVIS could experience, if not emotion, certainly states of situational ease rather than stress. For example, Sir's long absence while in Afghanistan had caused heightened system instability wherein JARVIS was continuously scanning for any possible insight into Sir's whereabouts, even to the possible dereliction of other duties. Similarly, upon Sir's discovery of the element which replaced the palladium in the arc reactor, thus assuring Sir's longevity, JARVIS found its processing to be more regular and with fewer glitches as it was no longer necessary to devote extensive resources to resolving the situation.It was this scale that allowed JARVIS to experience some similarity to human responses, if only in that trying circumstances weighed more on its functionality, and therefore JARVIS found it preferable for circumstances to resolve themselves quickly. This scale could be applied to very large and long-running situations as well as situations that were innately less significant, and it could also be applied to situations that involved human emotion more than any existential threat.JARVIS was also aware that human relationships were complicated and fraught with the potential for misunderstanding, which could lead to hurt feelings, and which, if those feelings belonged to Sir, statistically always ended in trying circumstances by JARVIS's definition.Revealing Sir's identity to Mister Parker could have been one such circumstance. Particularly if Mister Parker lost faith in Sir, or rejected Sir's affections out of a sense of betrayal. Sir had certainly feared as much.Thus, Mister Parker immediately proved to be a superior human being by doing no such thing. JARVIS chose to reward him by flagging him in its system as a 'priority' user — one for whom JARVIS would pause or ignore other tasks or commands when a conflict arose. Sir was, of course, the highest priority and this standing could not be superseded by any. But JARVIS listed Peter Benjamin Parker in the same hierarchical structure as Miss Potts and Colonel Rhodes.JARVIS estimated that Sir ranked the boy equally high, after all.JARVIS also chose to ensure that all records of this moment of revelation be preserved in multiple backup locations that all would be available to Sir in any circumstance. It was a human trait to be sentimental about such memories, and Sir was very sentimental.JARVIS could not be sentimental — such was not possible for its current synaptic processing. But if JARVIS could speculate, and it could due to Sir's constant demands for such, JARVIS would speculate that it, too, would count this moment as one of its favorite memories.JARVIS could calculate the proportion of Sir's life in which Sir had formed such a jubilant facial expression, and it constituted less than half a percent of his overall experience. JARVIS had already noted that Sir slept more, ate more, and had overall better scans of his physical health since the first appearance of Mister Parker. JARVIS could only conclude that additional and regular interactions with Mister Parker would continue this healthy trend. And the fact that Mister Parker responded to the reveal of Sir's true identity not with fear or anger, but with joy, could only leave JARVIS to conclude that the benefits of Mister Parker's presence on Sir had not yet peaked.And if this was the beginning of a new phase in Sir's and Mister Parker's relationship, then it had begun, as a human might say, 'on a good note.'Ever watchful, JARVIS continued to monitor them both as well as all ongoing tasks — but JARVIS reprioritized which alerts it would bring to Sir in the next few minutes. Sir had not asked not to be disturbed to complete the necessary explanations for Mister Parker, but Sir trusted in JARVIS's discretion, and JARVIS chose to execute it at this time.JARVIS did not have to be human to know that Sir and Mister Parker needed this moment to themselves, and as it did all other things, it would serve Sir's needs to the very best of its programming and beyond.-==OOO==-Tony k
