Chapter 1: Issue 01: Hot Cat on a Concrete Roof
    




Chapter Text
"Here's another one for ya, compliments of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man," read off the police officer once again appearing a minute too late to see that his job was already done for him and a note pinned to the upside down punk's web wrap. Crumpling the paper in irritation, he tossed it aside into one of the many festering trash cans that so elegantly complimented the alley so perfectly. Signaling to his men to cut him down and cuff him, he turned and walked back to his car to fill out the paper work.Watching the scene, curious as to the reaction of his nightly help, Spider-Man leaned over the roof top edge and sighed, once again seeing that the cops were more annoyed by his vigilante justice than eased by it. Nothing new, though, so he excused himself, not wanting to press his luck with time. A few speedy steps and a daring leap of the edge later and the familiar *thwip* sound was heard as a stream of science created web fluid sprung from his wrist and the web swinger lived up to his name as he left the police officer with that one glimpse of him before he took off for the night. Despite having been in the city, fighting crime and foiling other costumed super powered crime involvers, people still liked to look up and watch as he swung by over their fair city, gawking at the grace and agility they witnessed for only a moment's glance. He loved how he could cause a New Yorker, one who had grown old of craning their neck skyward, do it all over again like a tourist. That took some of the sting off the glare the police officer gave him.No time to swing around to relieve stress that night, no, he had plans. Tonight was a very special night for him, it was his and Mary Jane's first anniversary of marriage together. He had already sent her the gift, elegant and expensive, but it was to make up for the fact that he couldn't promise her a romantic evening out. He relished in how understanding she was, though, to that effect. She knew that when she married Spider-Man that she would not get the typical husband, she admitted that, but she told him that she got a better one through that. A smile spread under his mask as he day dreamed about how perfect she was for him, and his lapse in focus nearly caused him to come crashing through the window of a Times Square billboard. That was a close one, he thought. The last thing I need is to splat right onto the Virgin sign and have someone take a picture of that and run it on the front page.Five more minutes of swinging led him nearly all the way to his New York apartment before he heard a blood curdling alarm sound mixed with coming sirens. Halting his swing by perching upon the ledge of a building, joining a gargoyle in stare, he saw that the cause of this was a bank robbery and the perp was making her escape just as he had come into play. It was the Black Cat. More of a nuisance than a danger, really, but she was making away with what looked like a cliche bag of money. He hung his head low after looking to a large clock that over looked the street and gave himself an hour to get back to Mary Jane while it was still technically their anniversary. Focusing himself, he leaped off the granite and swung into action, literally.It didn't take him long to catch up with the voluptuous cat burglar, but her acrobatic skills were still something to be pitted against. She had noticed the web head with a few choice glances over her shoulder, peering out her black mask that complimented her face. The black leather clad woman with flowing ivory hair leaped and leaped, but Spider-Man was still able to make further leaps with his webs and superior agility. Just as she was about to make one more dash off the building, a snag upon her out reached wrists came and snapped her backwards. Wrists had been bound by the familiar web and a stream of it from it was led back to good ol' Spider-Man."Yeehaw! Caught ya, partner," jested the wrangling super hero, lifting the web up to hang and twist over a pipe and let her hang just inches off the ground, her back to the wall of the doorway that lead up from inside the building. Easing himself down, upside down, as he was prone to do, he stared Black Cat in the eyes with his big white saucers and smirked beneath the mask. "How many times do we have to go through this, Cat?" he inquired.Her full lips pulled into a smirk of their own, and her eye lids dropped a tad in a sultry manner, working herself into her seductive manner in order to escape police capture yet again with, no less, the aid of her current capture. "Until I get properly punished, I guess. Perhaps a spanking would set me right?", she reasoned, pursing her lips innocently and fluttering her eye lashes in form with that. Her hips slowly swayed, wantingly, and the web crawler fell distracted by her charm.Shaking it off, remembering his set time limit, he quickly reached down and snatched the bag of bills that was held
