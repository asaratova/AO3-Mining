Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
The majority of it had been easy for Tony… once the ball got rolling. First was Rhodey, whom he forever (jokingly) blamed for his self-esteem issues as a child. The words “You’re annoying. -JR” being written across Tony’s right bicep since the day he was born. For a brief time, yes, he’d been extremely embarrassed about those words, but his mother would always sit him down when he got upset over them and tell him he was a good person and maybe his soulmate was just joking or something like that.But no, Rhodey had meant it completely when he first met Tony. After evading the army for three weeks in regards to his father’s inventions, Rhodey finally caught up to Tony in Malibu. “You’re annoying,” he declared simply, approaching Tony in uniform.“And intelligent,” Tony replied with a smirk, taking a sip of a mojito. “I thought you would take a week to find me; obviously I’ve outsmarted you.”Rhodey wasn’t impressed, but he sat down and stole the mojito from Tony. “I’m gonna need more of these if I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with you,” he finally declared with a sigh.The next after him was Pepper, the words “I’m your new PA. -VP” in pleasing script on his left hip, slanting downward. It didn’t take a genius to figure out that relationship was going to be anything but platonic.After she said those words to Tony, he replied promptly with, “That’s nice. You’re fired.”Pepper was shocked for… well, a lot of reasons. For one, her soulmate was Tony Stark! And he’d just fired her because… why?“Is this because I’m your soulmate?” she demanded.Tony looked up at her, his eyes just barely displaying his surprise. “Okay, you’re unfired,” he decided. “My reason was because I don’t need a new PA for Stane to use to spy on me.”“I’m your PA, not his,” she assured him. She tried to tell herself that they were meant to be platonic because A, she was not going to get into a relationship with her boss, and B, she wasn’t going to quit just because he was her soulmate.It was a strange decade of denial.It was quite some time after that before he found any others, but when he did, “Rushman, Natalie Rushman. –NR,” “Mr. Stark. –SR,” “Do not touch me again. –TO,” “He’s got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. –BB,” and “Wanna give me a lift. -CB” came in short order. Despite having eight sets of words in all, only one wasn’t platonic so far, and the only one he hadn’t met didn’t exactly seem too happy to meet him judging by the words.He was born with all eight marks in a world that frowned upon having more than three, even if the majority of the relationships were platonic. Of course, being a billionaire softened the bullying he would have received, but it didn’t prevent Tony from feeling like an outcast. After all, who else would have that many marks?Apparently the answer to that question was Natasha, the third person he met, the one whose mark on him danced across his right shoulder, the name ‘Rushman’ in English both times, but the name ‘Natalie’ being translated back to Russian. In fact, the Avengers came to notice that Natasha’s words were in Russian for each of them, and they had each translated them at one point or another before meeting her. Still, that left three sets of words unaccounted for, one of which Tony only saw on accident after catching her in the shower- she said if he told anyone, his body would never be recovered.
 Generally, Natasha was rather open about her marks. Obviously the Avengers had all figured out each other’s marks in relation to one another, and she didn’t particularly care if people saw the one from whoever wanted to know how she was (she found out later that it was Sam Wilson) or the one who didn’t want to go somewhere with her. The only one she cared to hide properly was the one that surrounded a bullet wound she had gotten. “There is no ‘nice’ here. -JB” it read.It was… what, 1950? Maybe a couple of years earlier, but certainly no later. The modified soldier serum had slowed down her aging process and even though she was well into her twenties, she looked like she was fifteen at best. The Red Room, the Bolshoi, it was just one tangled mass in her head at the time, and she thought she was meeting a new ballet instructor.“It’s nice to meet you, sir,” she’d greeted him, a smile on her face.She’d been punched in the stomach by a metal fist and beaten until she was black and blue. Then her attacker, instructor, future lover, whatever he was, told her the words. It was then that she realized she wasn’t with the Bolshoi. She was a Black Widow. That was when the training truly began.“Hey, Nat, you with us?” Steve asked, and the former Russian flashed the group a smile, forcing a smile onto her face.“Sorry,” she apologized. “Spaced out.”
Steve had grown up embarrassed with his three marks. All of them were older than him, he was sure—it was rare to be born with the marks of those younger than you. “I’ve
