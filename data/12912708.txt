Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Tony’s spent his entire life lying to people in one way or another.It’s a fact that, amongst other things, makes him a less than ideal role model but, in his minimum defense, Tony likes to maintain that he’d come by the skill honestly at least.The rest of his impressive laundry list of character defects he’d picked up along the way in bits and pieces.But the lying?Yeah, that Tony had learned  young.  Had picked it up at Maria’s knee, had it pressed into his bones with the heavy weight of the back of Howard’s hand.And, like with anything else Tony put his massive intellect towards, he’d excelled at it from an early age.He’d developed a bit of a routine with it too, had picked up tips and tricks along the way that made the lies easier, better, more  solid.He was young, only seven or so, when he learned a twofold skill that would help to push him through the rest of his life.The first half was to pretend to be a great deal  less intelligent than he was while still being an undeniable genius.  It was a tightrope of sorts that he learned to walk quickly and carefully, all too aware of Howard’s growing resentment.The second half of that lesson was to  always lie about his childhood, about Maria and Howard and what life was like growing up with the both of them.Tony knew that nothing good would come out of anyone finding out about what life had been like for him inside the manor.He was fifteen going on sixteen and fresh out of having Sunset Bain rip his heart to  pieces when he learned to how lie to a lover until they proved they were worthy of the truth.Which, so far, none of them ever have.In the aftermath of that Tony had also learned to always give a half truth about any romantic entanglement someone questioned him about unless he found the association completely and totally  distasteful.And, from his time with Rhodey in MIT, he also learned to always embellish jokes and stories, to add hints of the ridiculous to the mundane in order to get the greatest effects.Or, just because they always made his best friend smile and laugh.But one of the most important truths he learned about lying was to always,  always, be honest with the company.  SI, it’s employees, it’s goals, the company as a whole was too important, had too much of an impact on other things, to ever lie about anything even tangentially related to it.In the end, SI and all of its associated issues became the one area of his life where Tony practiced honesty without fail.He’d made a game of the lying everywhere else though, had turned it into a bit of a pastime when he was younger and never really bothered to drop the habit.  He’d spent a good fraction of his free time playing around with reporters and the paparazzi, had enjoyed twisting their expectations of him to suit his moods.He’d been young and bitter then though.  Had been tired of living under a microscope and chafing at the bit of expectations he’d never asked for, all while being determined to get as much out of it as he could.So he’d twisted fact and given half truths and outrageous lies and ignored the way it  stung when they were all believed so very easily.  Even when it meant ignoring any evidence the the contrary that might pop up.Now though, after a lifetime of practice, the lying has lost a lot of its shine.  It’s become less of a  game and more of a tedious but second nature kind of reflex that he had down to a bit of an art form.Now, if he has to or if he wants to for whatever reason, Tony can lie as easily and intricately as he builds.Like with coding or robotics he can make an untruth  sing.He still enjoys it sometimes, in a melancholy and faintly bitter kind of way.  It’s a part of him that he knows reflects on what kind of person he truly is but it’s a skill he’s also grateful to have most of the time.  That ability to trade off dishonesty for truth and then back again in the blink of an eye without anyone being the wiser.It’s protected him in so many different ways over the years.Rhodey’s always warned him it would come back to bite him in the ass one day but Tony’s pretty sure he never expected it to happen like  this.But, to be fair, futurist or not, neither had Tony.He never expected that one day he would find himself in a situation where he was being completely and totally  honest with the press in a way that didn't involve SI.Or that, in that moment, not a single one of them would even come  close to believing him.“I am Iron Man,” Tony tells the reporters in the room.Tells the whole entire  world.And then the entire world just collectively goes … Bullshit.~~~“Stop laughing,” Tony pouts at Rhodey from where he’s sulking on the couch.It’s been a few hours now since the disastrous press conference where Tony outed himself as a superhero and  no one believed him  and the sting  still hasn’t faded.“I  can’t,” Rhodey wheezes.  He’s bent double, hands on his knees, shoulders heaving and face red.There are real, honest to Tesla  tears in his eyes.“I hope
