Chapter 1: dark patches
    




Chapter Text
Tony drinks.He sits in relative darkness, the TV on mute, Friday running searches like she has been every day for the past month. A month, since Quentin Beck’s grand plan crumpled underneath him on that bridge. A month, since a flash of light was able to distract Peter just as he was about to bring Beck down. A month, since Beck snatched him, since both of them disappeared. An entire. Month. Tony has been useless, since he snapped his fingers, since he was on death’s door and only Helen’s medical prowess was able to bring him back from the brink. He’s got a new, iron arm that he still isn’t used to, and half the time he forgets how to fucking walk. He doesn’t like the wheelchair. He doesn’t want to have to use it, and he practices walking every damn day so he can get his sea legs back. They’re still working on the scarring, still trying to make him less fucking terrifying than he was when he finally woke up. He can’t put on a suit, not yet, probably not ever again, and as soon as he saw what Peter was going through, in Europe, he just about lost his shit. Fury went over his head in pretty much every way he could have, including giving the kid the glasses, which he wasn’t supposed to get until he was of age. Until Tony was dead, under the ground, not holed up in the newly repurchased tower while the compound gets rebuilt.But the kid was so strong. So goddamn capable, despite his mistakes, despite the hell he’d gone through. Happy was able to go and check in with him when Tony couldn’t, even though Tony nearly gave himself a stroke trying to get onto the plane. Pepper stopped him, with a gentle hand, despite how she’d wanted him to be able to be there for Peter, too. She knows how much the kid means to him, after everything. His kid. The brother Morgan always knew she had, even when he was just a bedtime story and an array of old photos.Fury fell for Beck’s story. Peter did too. Tony wished, above all else, that he had seen the asshole’s face while Peter was filling him in on the details. He knew him, as soon as he saw him on the news, but by then it was too late. He was using a different name, when Tony knew him. But his anger only grew, how fucking unhinged he was only got worse—and the nightmare started. A way he could get to Tony without touching Tony himself. 
I’ll keep you updated. I promise. 

I love you, kid. Rhodey’s on his way, alright? He’s coming. He’s gonna go as fast as he can.

I love you too. I’ll be okay. I promise. I can do this.
The last thing Tony heard Peter say.Rhodey, Happy and Fury traversed the London landscape immediately afterwards. They found the glasses, but not Spider-Man. There was footage enough to incriminate Beck for what he was, but somehow, nobody was able to get a shot of when he grabbed Peter. Peter was knocking him around, looked like he was getting the upper hand, and then that flash of light. Gone. Gone.Tony kept his identity a secret, because the footage didn’t show his face, but he let the Avengers know. Steve had come back with Natasha right after his returning the stones journey, and she was eager to start looking for Peter as soon as Tony informed her of what happened. Clint came out of retirement to help her search. Steve and Bucky went off on their own, exploring avenues others couldn’t. Tony wasn’t any good to anybody, and Bruce stayed with him and helped him with his physical therapy, as did Sam, which was a bit of a surprise. Everyone felt the weight of his loss, after everything he’d gone through to get Peter back in the first place. May pretty much moved in, and they grieved together. They watched the footage, over and over until they could remember every damn millisecond. There was something sallow in her eyes, and Tony knew it was in his own, too. The only solace he got was when Pepper ran her hands through his hair, or when Morgan curled up in his lap, holding onto him tight, like she was trying to keep him here. A month. A whole, entire month.Tony has never felt like more of a failure. Only time that comes close is when the kid fucking died, but this time is worse because he should have protected him better. He never should have let this happen, after what happened before. May is sitting on the couch on the opposite side of the room, and she’s going over all the notes he’s had splayed out on the coffee table since this hell started. He’s got Beck’s files from when he worked for him—when he used to call himself Dean Carroway—and information on all the places Peter is not. A list with too many marks on it. Rhodey, Happy and Fury are in London again, and they’ve been back and forth so many times that Tony thinks they need to get apartments there.He gets up, taking measured steps over to where May is. He’s getting better, at this whole walking thing. He can run now, for a few moments straight, and not fall into a heap of useless limbs when he has to stop. He told himself he’d be walking like a normal person again
