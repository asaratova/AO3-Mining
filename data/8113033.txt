Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
She was
nervous.
She was a
decorated marine, a soldier, an agent. She was the Deputy Director of
S.H.I.E.L.D., for Thor's sake. But there she was, outside Pepper's
office, nervous to knock on her door.
And she
wasn't nervous about what she was there to ask, she was uneasy
because of the reason she was asking, and the fact that once she got
what she was there to ask for, there was no backing off from it all.
She sighed
deeply, then knocked.
“Come in,
Maria.”
Of course,
Pepper's assistant had announced her.
She opened
the door, seeing Tony Stark sitting across from Pepper, in one of the
chairs on the other side of the desk. On the right, in a small couch,
Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton were sitting like it was a cozy
Saturday instead of the office of the most important CEO of the
world.
“I can
come back later if you're busy.”
“We were
actually just chatting. There seems to be no way of bringing everyone
back together for the time being.”
“I'm sorry
to hear that” Maria said, more towards Natasha and Clint than
Pepper.
“What did
you want to tell me?” Pepper encouraged her.
Maria
sighed
again. “I wanted to ask you for a five days leave.”
Stark faked
a gasp and sat upright. “Maria Hill takes vacations?”
Maria
rolled
her eyes and sighed again.
“Trust me
I'd much rather work. But my sister is getting married.”
“Want to
sit down?” Natasha gestured to the place on the couch next to her
and as soon as Maria sat down she turned towards her. “I thought
your sister was already married” she pointed out.
“Wait, you
have a sister?” Tony was more and more surprised.
“I have
two sisters and a brother. One is forty and has two kids and one is
thirty-four and getting married. And it's bad enough that I'm
thirty-two and attending her wedding single, but my parents are
nagging me so badly lately, since I've stopped working for
S.H.I.E.L.D. they have been harassing me non-stop to get me to settle
down with, and I quote, 'someone decent, Maria, don't be too picky'.”
“High
expectations, I see” Pepper laughed lightly.
“I just
wish they'd stop for ten minutes sending me pictures of possible
dates they want to set me up with for the wedding. It's awful.”
“When do
you need your leave?”
“In two
weeks, if that's okay. Please say it's not, it's too short notice and
I must stay” she sighed, running a hand through her hair.
Pepper
snorted. “You deserve a break, Maria. Go and have fun!”
Maria
rolled
her eyes and sighed again. Pepper was in deep thought for a moment
and then she tapped her hand on her desk like she had a brilliant
idea on the spot.
“Take
Tony!”
Maria
laughed out loud. “Okay, first thing, there is absolutely no chance
in hell that I'll take this man” she pointed to Stark “to my
sister's wedding. He breaks havoc wherever he goes, plus I can't
stand him.”
“Oh, Hill
please. You love me” he scoffed.
“Second
thing, you and him are on every cover of every magazine. Someone
might know something's up” she said, shrugging.
“Then take
Barton. Nobody knows he's married” Pepper proposed.
“I don't
think Laura would be thrilled” she laughed again. “Plus I can't
take him.”
“Why not,
am I not 'someone decent' enough?” he asked, faking offense.
“No,
you're great Clint” Maria sighed again. “But I've been out to my
family since I was sixteen, I doubt they would buy that we're
together anymore than me being with Tony Stark.”
There was
silence for a long while.
“You've
been” Tony started, then paused. “Out to you're family? As in”
he gestured with his hand and said nothing more.
Natasha
was,
surprisingly, the one to roll her eyes.
“Do you
have a problem with non-straight people?” the redhead asked,
unimpressed.
“No, of
course not!” he said almost offended. “I just didn't know.”
“Have you
seen me, Stark? How can you not know?” Maria laughed a little,
then, looking around, she realized everyone seemed kind of fazed,
except for Natasha. “Really, you didn't know?” she asked a little
more serious.
“I knew”
Natasha said casually. “Don't mind them, they're not spies, and
you're not that easy to figure out.”
“Well,
Romanoff, coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.”
“I've been
trying to set you up with both James or Sam for months, you could
have said something, Maria” Pepper told her, with one of her
eyebrows raised.
“You've
been what now” she grimaced. “I'm sorry, I didn't really
notice, I've been a little preoccupied lately.”
Pepper
sighed and sat back in her chair.
“So, about
the leave?”
“Sure,
fill the form and I'll sign it” Pepper told her with a small smile.
“Great”
Maria stood up, reaching in her back pocket and handing Pepper the
aforementioned piece of paper, already filled.
She
laughed,
shaking her head, because of course Maria already filled one. She
signed it quickly and told her to take it to her assistant to have it
archived.
“Sorry to
have interrupted your chat. I'm going home, if that's alright.”
“Of
course, you finished your shift almost one hour ago” Pepper told
her.
