Chapter 1: Tony Stark
    




Chapter Text

Tony
 
 
He was curious.  That was all.  He knew he wasn’t worthy.  Really, he wanted to study it, and to do that, he needed to move it from the gym where Thor had left it to his lab.  What was it made of?  Could he duplicate it?  Could someone else duplicate it?  There were a thousand questions Tony wanted to answer about the hammer.  He just had to get it from the gym, down two floors to his lab and start running tests.  

He glanced around.  No one was here.  No one would see if he couldn’t pick it up.  And he wouldn’t be able to.  He knew it.  There was no way he was ‘worthy’ or whatever he needed to be to pick up the damn hammer.  He stroked his fingers along the leather bound handle and smiled. Yet.  It was hard to not want to be worthy.  He knew he wasn’t.  Never would be.  

But...

His fingers tightened around the grip and Tony gave a half-hearted tug.  The hammer didn’t budge.  He knew it wouldn’t.  He wasn’t worthy.  By a long shot.  Tony let the handle go and frowned down at it.  Fuck, now he needed to go find Thor and try to explain the tests he wanted to run on the hammer because the blonde was the only one who could pick the damn thing up.  

On this planet anyways.
