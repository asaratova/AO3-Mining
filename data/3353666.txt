Chapter 1: Jane Foster
    




Chapter Text
Jane's first meeting with Darcy wasn't anything special. She was just another student with eyes glued to her phone and the latest top hit blaring through her ear buds. Knit hat, Culver U. sweatshirt and eye-bleeding pink yoga pants, there were a hundred or so students just like her running around campus. Half of them were probably more qualified, too.Darcy Lewis was the only applicant for a semester long internship. The only reason Jane hadn't sent her on her way was because she was holding two cups of coffee in her hands. So far, she had only sipped at the one in her left hand. Jane stared for a long moment at that extra cup of coffee in the student's right hand before looking back to the file on her desk. “You're a political science major?”“Yep.” Darcy popped the 'p' and then took an aggravatingly loud slurp of the half-drunk cup. Jane flinched only a little bit. “This internship is for science majors, why did you apply?”Darcy leaned forward. “Alright, this is kinda a cop out. You know Professor Bricker?” Jane nodded. “Well, I had to drop out of his class last semester because he kept making grabby hands at the girls.” Even beneath the bulky sweatshirt it was easy to see Darcy was a woman with natural bounty. “I really need those six science credits to graduate.”Jack Bricker was a grabby old bastard so really, she couldn't fault the girl. Still, Jane needed someone who knew the math and science and would be able to walk away with something from this. Darcy didn't fit that bill in any respect. Opening her mouth with every intention of declining her application, she paused. The other woman had taken the full and still steaming cup of coffee and slide it across the desk to Jane in a very deliberate manner.She should have been embarrassed by the amount of longing in her stare. It had been a long and frustrating day and it wasn't even close to being over yet.  Jane leveled a look of unimpressed disappointment at Darcy. “Is this a bribe?” Darcy raised her eyebrows with a knowing smirk. “There's more where that came from.”Well... what's the worst that could happen, right? And there was no one else, coffee girl was better than nothing. “You start next week, be here at ten thirty on Thursday morning and we'll work out a schedule.” All of this was said in one hurried breath before inhaling the coffee. Her entire mouth was screaming in protest from the sudden and scalding liquid, but the effect was instantaneous. “Bring coffee.” She hummed into the plastic lid. Darcy leaned back in her seat and tipped her own cup in a toast to what was probably a bad idea. “You won't regret this. Sciencey stuff isn't my best subject, but I can organize and micro-manage like a boss.”Such a bad idea, but such good coffee.Something in the back of her mind clicked as she sipped on her glorious fuel. “Lewis? Weren't you the coed who tazered Bricker.”Darcy's wide mouth split her face into a prideful smile full of teeth. “Yes I did.”
