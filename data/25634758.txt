 “What we call the beginning is often the end 


 And to make an end is to make a beginning 


 The end is where we start from.”

Years. Broken into months into weeks into days—into hours, minutes, seconds—into moments. Simple at one end, complex at the other. In Draco’s experience, moments, even when simple, had a habit of becoming irretrievable. Moments grew, stretched, multiplied into ages and eras that defined whole stretches of measurable time. Draco regretted several moments in his life, some within his control, some without: all of them irretrievable in nature. At a certain point, wedged between ‘what-ifs’ of his own devising, he’d stopped trying to keep track of those regrettable moments: now and then, pushing and pulling, coming and going, beginning and end. Moments were only moments for just as long. After that, he had no control.
He’d wanted it to happen something like this:
A confident knock on his father’s study door—a pause, just for a beat—enough to acknowledge that Draco had engaged in the formality of it, before he let himself in anyway: poised, sure, a far cry from his former self so desperate for Lucius Malfoy’s impossible approval.
His father would recognize the shift; Draco had been in Europe apprenticing for his potions mastery for just over a year. Time heals all wounds and other such rot. Lucius would offer him a seat, and maybe even a drink of something forbidden and expensive from his personal stores. He’d ask Draco about his mastery with reluctant pride that Draco had taken initiative to make himself employable, respectful—a potentially productive member of a society that saw the Malfoy name as something actively unproductive. And all of this despite the fact that Draco didn’t  have  to work and never would: not so long as his inheritance, every last drop of his money tied up in the family name, continued to pay his way in the world. 
Draco would share his thoughts with his father, more than he normally did. He’d share just how beautiful he found Sarajevo, how refreshing it had been to be nearly-anonymous on a day-to-day basis. How he’d stopped needing a Calming Draught every night before he went to bed. How he’d tried dating, women who had no idea about his money or his name or his family history. How the dating hadn’t gone very well, but the shagging had been a welcome change after two years of probation chained to the manor. 
And that little detail, oversharing and a touch inappropriate, well, that would make Lucius  laugh.  He’d really laugh, in a way Draco hadn’t heard in years, certainly not since the war, maybe not since Draco started at Hogwarts. The sound of Lucius’s laughter existed—bound by time—in Draco’s memories before he’d started school, before the ominous creep of a new war had started making its presence known, rising like bile and tainting the taste of any laughter that might have come later. 
Lucius would listen, be interested. He’d still be stern, stoic, stubbornly aristocratic in the way he sat with his back straight and expression schooled. But somewhere behind his gray eyes, a near mirror image of Draco’s own, would be a glimpse of the father figure Draco had so desperately wished to please, to impress, to emulate with every drop of the magic in his blood and bones.
It would be a short conversation, but meaningful. It would be representative of a change in their relationship: healing after their respective time spent in Azkaban, under house arrest, and then apart for a year. Draco would leave the study reacquainted with his father, cautiously hopeful that, man to man, they might be able to find a way to see each other again now that the fog of war had dissipated. 
Instead, things went awry from the very first moment.
Draco didn’t even have the chance to knock on the door, and he certainly didn’t feel confident or sure of himself. He mostly felt tired, exhausted from several international Floo connections ferrying him from the Balkans and all the way back to Wiltshire.
“Enter,” spoken through the heavy wooden door stopped Draco’s fist in its tracks, a centimeter from contact.
Draco took a deep breath through his nose, lips pressed together. He pushed the door open.
Lucius Malfoy looked tired. Draco’s thoughts stalled on that observation as he approached the desk, watching Lucius as he scanned the parchment in front of him, evidently much more important than the son he’d not seen in a year. Lucius hadn’t looked much like himself since Azkaban in Draco’s fifth year.  He’d looked even worse after a second stint while he awaited trial after the war. He’d steadily withered, whittled away, in the years of house arrest he’d been ordered to endure without the use of his magic. A year apart had not changed any of that, only made it more apparent as Draco’s eyes caught on the sunken pallor of his father’s skin and the dark circles beneath
