FAQ

 HOW DO I KNOW IF MY PROMPT HAS BEEN FILLED? 
When you comment a prompt(s) that do not need clarification or break the rules, I will leave the comment untouched until I have finished the prompt(s). One your prompt(s) have been finished, I will reply to the comment and tell you what I have called it/them.
 CAN I COMMENT MORE THAN ONE PROMPT? 
Yes, you can! You can comment up to three prompts at a time, and then once the three of them have been fully completed and you have been notified of this, you can comment three more. Please restrain yourself and remember that I am only one person, I cannot keep writing prompts until the end of time without facing burnout so please do not continue to comment three prompts each time that I finish the last set of requests. I also prefer that people comment all three prompts on the same comment so that I can keep track of them. If you comment multiple prompts with multiple different comments, I will gently remind you the first time and then give you a strike the second time.
 WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE YOUR RULES? 
Then you should find someone else to write your prompts. I have set what I will and will not write so that I do not have to write something I’m uncomfortable with. I am a real person with real emotions and I expect you, a real person with real emotions, to respect my boundaries like I would respect yours. If you request something that is on the “Will Not” list then I will gently remind you the first time, and give you strikes each time you do it again.
 WHAT ARE STRIKES? 
Strikes are something that I give people when they have violated my boundaries and rules. I go by the policy of three strikes and you’re out. I will tell you each time you get a strike, and how many you have each time. If you get three strikes, I will delete any and all comments that you post on ALL of my collections from that moment forward. Again, I am a real person and I am no longer tolerating people pushing me around when I’m doing something for them for free.
 WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE WHAT I GOT? 
If you had a vague prompt: You get what you get. I can't read your mind and cannot give you specifics if you only gave me a ship and an undetailed outline. You are not allowed to request a rewrite.If you left a specific prompt: I apologize for not writing it correctly, sometimes my own creativity spins out of control and it turns out different or I forget the prompt specifics. Feel free to point it out to me if you feel cheated or like your prompt was inadequately filled. I will be willing to rewrite it, but you must be aware that I will fill prompts before rewriting anything
 WHY IS MY PROMPT TAKING SO LONG? 
I have five sets of collections and people requesting prompts on each of them as well as my own stories (on top of familial, social, romantic, and academic obligations) so sometimes it takes a while for me to get to some prompts. It’s also possible that th
