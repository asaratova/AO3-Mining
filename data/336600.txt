If a top secret file on Phil Coulson and Clint Barton's relationship existed, it would look something like this.

The Inciting Incident
Fury calls Coulson into his office and slides a dossier across the desk.  “Got a new one for you, Agent.”Coulson flips through the file and raises an eyebrow at Fury.  “So now we’re literally bringing in circus performers. Don’t we already have our hands full with Stark?”Fury ignores him.  “This guy is the best marksman in the world. He’s been in Special Ops for a while now, but gets kicked out of every agency he’s in.”“Insubordination with regard to authority figures,” Coulson reads, unimpressed. “We’re bringing him in.”“Of course we are,” Coulson sighs. Fury crosses his arms over his chest as Coulson puts down the file.  “I want you to personally make it your responsibility to keep him in check.”“If no one else ever could, what makes you believe I can?”Fury’s lips curve into an oh-so-rare smile.  “I’m not saying you can. But you’re damned well going to try.”“So now I’m a babysitter,” Coulson turns to leave. “Your reading material,” Fury helpfully reminds him.Coulson begrudgingly picks up the dossier, knowing its contents won’t reveal anything on the man he hasn’t already concluded from a quick glance over. It’s one of the first and only times he’s wrong.  __________________________
First Impressions
Clint’s been stalking around the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters with his nose turned up in the air for about five minutes now. No one saw him come in and that’s his first problem with this place.  He finds Natasha in the gym and is pleased to see a familiar face as they’ve worked on a few missions together with different teams. He’d heard S.H.I.E.L.D. snatched her up before the Russians could have a crack at her.“Heard you’ve got a handler,” she says by way of greeting, not bothering to look up from her spot at the punching bag. “Hello to you too,” Clint deadpans as he watches her fists fly. She pauses and raises one eyebrow as if to say ‘Oh please, since when do I do pleasantries.’ ’ Except she’d never vocalize it. It’s one of the reasons Clint likes her. Clint’s lips twitch.  “Who’s the guy, then?” He’s not surprised Fury wrangled up some lackey to deal with him. He’d be insulted if he hadn’t.  “Agent Coulson. Hard as nails. They call him the Ice Man.”Clint rolls his eyes.  Honestly, special agents were more infantile than anything the circus had to offer.  Including the fucking clowns.“And what is your assessment, Agent Romanov?”She throws a kick to the bag, then a quick left punch.  “Smart, highly capable, the one you’d want watching your back in case things go to shit.”Clint hums.  After a pause she adds, “And he smiles even less than I do.”“Well, now I’m impressed.”She kicks the bag into his stomach.“Agent Barton,” comes a calm voice behind him. “We weren’t expecting you for another hour yet.”Clint turns on his heel and faces who he assumes is Agent Coulson (he is rarely wrong in his assumption) except for the fact that he was anticipating some green, wet behind the ears hack.  This guy looks like a seasoned vet in his pristine suit, polished shoes, and perfectly straight tie.  It seems as though the other agents weren’t exaggerating.  He glances at Natasha, who’s now standing beside him.   She gives him a sidelong look that says, ‘told you so.’Whatever, this was just a minor setback.  Clint could still break this guy, he was sure of it.  “Perhaps you should have anticipated such an event. I mean, will criminal masterminds from other galaxies announce their arrival?”The man levels Clint a flat but deadly stare.  “Are you comparing yourself to alien overlords, Agent?”Clint shrugs. “I like to think I have a bit more style. And grace.”  The man remains unmoved.  Clint gives up with an internal sigh and raises his chin.  “You my babysitter, then?”“Agent Coulson,” he says and offers his hands.  Clint has a feeling he only does so because it’s standard procedure.  “And I’m not your babysitter. Excuse us, Agent Romanov.”“Sir,” she says and Clint can hear the amusement in her tone. Coulson starts walking out of the gym and Clint follows him with long strides to catch up. “So, you got a first name?” he asks, falling into step with Coulson.“Not where you’re concerned.”Clint grabs his chest in mock pain.  “Agent Coulson, I’m wounded. What if your life depended on it? What if that same alien overlord whose arrival you failed to anticipate was holding you with hostage with a ray-gun, and he told me the only way to save your life was if I told him your Christian name?”Coulson, the bastard, doesn’t even break his stride.  “I’d say this is the most absurd circumstance we’d ever encountered and I would hope you’d deliver a kill shot with the talents you supposedly possess.”“Supposedly?” Clint huffs as they come to a stop in front of a door.  Coulson unlocks it and waves at the open doorway.“These are your living quarters.  Curfew is 2200 hours.”“Are you sh
