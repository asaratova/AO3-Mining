The proper Formation of Object Darcy May Lewis was well underway. Status reports from Object Hawkeye had indicated that the capability, and therein encompassed learning-curve, of aforementioned Object in hand-to-hand-combat was above average and observation of the training sessions affirmed this.Apart from the training, Object Darcy May Lewis had withstood an assault by enemy operatives and with a cut of 62.5% on her first try.And while The Winter Soldier had known that Object Darcy May Lewis was talented from the moment he’d set eyes on it, he hadn’t quite been prepared for the outcome of honing said potential – the sessions with Object Hawkeye hadn’t been afoot for more than a few months (three months and 25 days to date) and Object Darcy May Lewis reached levels of proficiency that spoke volumes for itself.Winter Soldier had decided that it was time to take matters into his own hands.Basic Combat was good and fine and it had gotten Object Darcy May Lewis thus far, but the Threat Level remained a mere 2 when it could be well above 7 – and now that The Asset had come closer to The Object it was imperative that the latter knew how to defend itself in case of severe malfunction of the former.Thus said, Winter Soldier had chosen an appropriate combat style to suit the needs and abilities of Object Darcy May Lewis and found himself looking forward to the commencement of his training with Object Darcy May Lewis. Previous interludes with it had allowed him a glimpse to the preferred learning style of Object Darcy May Lewis and he had no doubt that he would know just how to implement his lessons.**Object Darcy Lewis looked uneasy the first time Winter Soldier positioned himself opposite of it, but he opted for an unthreatening posture and, waiting for Object Darcy May Lewis to read him correctly – it was notably capable of that – settled into his first position.Unhurriedly, but with quick eyes – and even quicker understanding – Object Darcy May Lewis copied his movement; Winter Soldier was pleased and would, in the course of the next 120 Minutes, not be disappointed by the attentiveness and eye for detail of his newly acquired pupil.Winter Soldier did however have to make a conscious effort – for the both of them – to ignore Object Captain Asshat observing from the side-lines. He was suitably content that Object Darcy Lewis did not appear to notice, signalling that it was fully focussed on their lesson.**Knowledgeable about Object Darcy Lewis’ habits as he was, Winter Soldier made certain that it would be properly maintained after its’ training sessions with Object Hawkeye (Tuesday and Friday) as well as his own sessions with it (Monday and Wednesday). Sustenance was of great import and seeing as the working environment of Object Darcy Lewis had not seen to the lack of Handling Network as it would have been fit, The Asset had made certain that Object Darcy Lewis would be properly nourished.This particular accord had been struck well before his direct Training of Object Darcy Lewis and he came to understand that the Object derived great joy from being treated correctly – considering that he, too, benefitted much from the presence of Object Darcy Lewis within his near vicinity, he had come to establish a rhythm in their encounters that the Object was not averse to.Add to this that Object Darcy Lewis had an exceedingly pleasant voice when it reported about its’ day and would let him take liberties with its’ physical transport even within the transparent confines of its’ working place and Winter Soldier found himself seeking out Object Darcy Lewis rather regularly and enjoying this rapport.**Object Darcy Lewis was very accommodating, he found.When it would retreat to its’ Safe House over the course of the week’s end, Winter Soldier was always welcome to join, which provided a much needed change of scenery from Head Quarters.Object Captain Wedgie – he understood that Object Darcy Lewis had titles on rotation where his Former Mission was concerned – had put some effort into hindering Winter Soldier from following Object Darcy at the beginning, but had quickly been circumvented – he was highly appreciative of this development. Especially since Object Darcy Lewis had implemented Winter Soldier’s Security Measures in the Safe House and would prepare чай in a most efficient and satisfying way, ensuring a maximum output of the quality and taste of the leaves.In the evening Winter Soldier would gladly sit down to hone the tactical skills of Object Darcy by engaging in competitions at “Sinking Ships”, “Checkers” or “Chess” and was most intrigued to find that this was the field in which his pupil shone brightest.After, or before depending on their schedule, such tête-à-têtes, Object Darcy would then allow him to spend his time as he pleased – either by reading, gathering intel on what it called ‘pop-culture’ or deconstructing appliances he was interested in. Especially the latter calmed him and whenever he experience
