The Hulk really isn't such a bad guy once you get to know him, and, more importantly, once he gets to know you.  As the weeks go by the Avengers keep assembling, keep saving the city from various bad guys, and a pattern emerges fairly consistently: if given a target, the Hulk can and will go after that target.  If given teammates, the Hulk can manage to work with those teammates (and not smash them).  Nobody noticed when the military was attempting to solve the problem with larger and larger caliber bullets, but the Hulk has perception, focus.Clint kind of likes the Hulk, actually.  Sometimes, though, Bruce will hulk out accidentally, or the battle will be unsatisfying, like that time they thought they had another Ivan Vanko on their hands and it turned out to just be a dude with a car battery ("Irony of ironies," Tony had muttered) and some junk from Radio Shack.  On days like that, it suddenly becomes a priority to get the Hulk to de-Hulk himself.Clint happens to be the only one in Avengers mansion the time Bruce stubs his toe really hard on the coffee table, flushes green, triples in size, and breaks the couch they're sitting on."Shit," Clint says, putting down the bag of popcorn he's holding and trying to extricate himself from the wreckage.  "Uh.  Hi, buddy."The Hulk twists among what's left of the couch and stares at Clint for a long moment.  "Remember me? We fight together.  Guy with the bow and arrows?" Clint mimes shooting a bow."ROBIN," the Hulk says, and Clint is never going to forgive Tony for telling the Hulk that was his name."Yeah," Clint sighs.  "You okay? Can you try not to wreck the place?"At this the Hulk stands, shedding stray pieces of demolished furniture, and starts huffing and pacing.  It's not very good for the floors."NO FIGHT."  This is apparently a very bad thing."No, sorry, we're all out of cyborgs and mutants and things today." Clint watches as the Hulk's pacing gets faster, as he casually takes out an (apparently non-load-bearing, what a relief) plaster column with his fist, as he starts grunting and growling with increasing frustration and impatience."Okay, maybe let's get out of the house," Clint says.That's how they end up in the mansion's ostentatious backyard, with Clint inventing obstacle courses (mostly using some pretty old trees that were in the ground half an hour ago, but what are you gonna do), running the Hulk through drills, firing arrows for him to leap and snatch out of the air, and, when he runs out of other ideas, having him run in circles as fast as he can for twenty minutes straight.  The dude who does the lawn is going to have a coronary, but at least no one is injured and the house is still standing afterwards.When Natasha and Steve come back home a few hours later, they find Clint sitting on the floor with the Hulk, who's all tucked up in about seven blankets, stroking his hair and singing to him softly.  He discovered about half an hour ago that the Hulk is soothed by music – how Looney Toons of him – and has been running through his rusty memories of lullabyes ever since.  The Hulk's head is propped up on pillows and resting partially in Clint's lap, which means it's pretty heavy but bearable.  Natasha raises an eyebrow, and Clint blushes."He's really just like a big kid," he hurries to explain.  "Like a toddler.  Let him get his energy out and then put him down for a nap and he's fine." "That's – adorable?" Steve says, sounding surprised.  Natasha, who knows a little more about Clint and his feelings about kids, doesn't say anything, but gives him half a smile. Clint is saved from having to say anything more, because the Hulk picks that moment to sigh deeply in his sleep, cuddle a little further against Clint's thigh - ouch - and shrink down into Bruce again."Aw," Natasha says.  "He's all tuckered out."Bruce doesn't wake up, just starts snoring softly against Clint's lap.  After a second, Clint goes back to stroking his hair. 
2. smash
There's the time after a battle when they can't find the Hulk, which is a new special kind of terror; usually the Hulk makes his presence known, and if he's not here, where is he? And what is he doing?  The rest of the team fans out across the city to look for him, and it's Natasha who eventually finds him, sitting against a brick wall in an alleyway, poking his giant green finger under a dumpster."Uh, Hulk?" she says.  She's still not used to calling him that.  "Bruce? The fight's over, wanna come for pizza?""SHHHHHH," the Hulk rumbles, making more noise than Natasha could make with a scream.  As she gets closer, she notices movement under the dumpster.A moment later the Hulk straightens up, holding a tiny kitten in his enormous palm.  Natasha, who's not stupid and knows an amazing PR moment when she sees one, gets out her phone and takes a video.  Soon the whole litter – seven or eight kittens who can't be more than three weeks old, with no momma cat in sight – is out from under the dumpster and c
