Chapter 1: Fudging it up.
    




Chapter Text
May 2006The wizarding war had been brutal, not too long, but the death toll was high. People were scared, and rightly so, they had all lost so much.In their time of need they had looked to Harry Potter, and he had saved them, a seventeen year old had won the war, but at what cost? The thing about fear, is that it drives you mad, makes you reckless, makes you question everything. Wizarding Britain was scared, they were lost and broken. It was easy to slip between the cracks. Cornelius Fudge took back control of the Ministry, he snuck in while people were fighting at Hogwarts and he regained his power.And people had forgotten what he had done, that he had stuck his head in the sand, that he had denied the return of Voldemort and that he had allowed him to build up his forces, to escalate the war, they had forgotten, and he had thrived.The public needed support, they looked to him, but they looked to their saviour too. And that certainly wouldn't do.So what could he do about the Potter boy?'Could he be held accountable?What had he done?How powerful was he?Is he controllable?'Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge smiled viciously at each other as they plotted the downfall of the Boy-Who-Lived.
