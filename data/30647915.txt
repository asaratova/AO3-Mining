Notes:
This fanfic does include child abuse and underage forced oral sex, but it’s non graphic and only mentioned a few times. Reminder I’m not supporting these subjects it’s just a story. If you have any other short story ideas centred in this Universe feel free to let me know <3




Chapter Text

August 1st

“He’s not the prophecy child.”Severus turned to face the old headmaster with a raised brow “What?” He drawled because, surely he’d heard that wrong. Either that or Dumbledore really had lost the plot.“The dark lord marked him as a distraction, the prophecy calls for a child born to those who thrice defied him. That can’t be Harry as his father’s but a muggle.”“James Potter is not a muggle.” He spat, the name still leaving a horrible taste on his tongue even after all these years.“Well, James isn’t his father. It would appear that Lily cheated on him. His real father is a muggle man by the name of Stark, Trelawney has seen it”“You can’t be serious…” he began, stopping when he saw the look Dumbledore gave him, the old man nodding slowly.“Right,” the Headteacher clapped, swiftly moving away from the subject as though it hadn’t even been broached. “we’ve got some work cut out for us, we need to find the true prophecy child.”“No.” Snape gasped, that can’t be right. If Harry isn’t James’ then that means… “We need to get him out of there, he can’t stay with the Dursleys. He has a father now he can-”“Until he comes to this school, Harry is not of our concern.”“But sir! You heard what McGonagall said- ‘they’re one of the worst sort’. We can’t leave him there-”“Severus there is no time. You didn’t seem to care much the night we took him there.”“That was before I-” before I what? How could I possibly justify leaving Lily’s boy with those people? With the very same woman who hurt and bullied Lily all throughout her childhood for being different. It shouldn’t have made a difference whether or not James was his father, he’s still Lily’s and he was just a baby. Oh Merlin, how could I do this?“Sort yourself out Severus, the boy is no longer of importance.”Snape watched as Dumbledore stormed out of the room, with only one thought running through his head, I have to get Lily’s boy out of there. And to do that I have to find the child’s true father.~~~~~ August 8th ~~~~~Tony threw himself onto the couch with a groan, that meeting had been long. He was about ready to lose himself in mindless TV when the door opened.“Happy, didn’t anybody ever teach you to knock?”“Sorry Tony but you need to see this.” The former bodyguard passed him a letter with his name on it, wearing a concerned face. Normally, he’d have complained about being interrupted but by the look in his friend’s eyes he knew it was important. What happened? Who died?He read through it and his heart immediately started pounding. It was a photograph of a small child who bore a striking resemblance to him, he knew it wasn’t him though because of the kid’s bright green eyes and beaten down exterior. On the back it read ‘Harry Potter. Born July 31st 2007, mother Lily Evans. He’s your son and you need to get him. 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, England.’The amount of claims he received of ‘long lost children’ was ridiculous, but never had he seen one that looked so much like him. And the name, Lily, he remembered her. Something within him told him that this wasn’t a ruse, this was really his son. Harry.~~~~~ Six Years Ago~~~~~Lily approached him at the bar planning to yell at him, not at all expecting what that would lead to. This guy had punched James in the nose and broken it. And yes, James was being a dick and was practically begging to be put into place and yes, she did have to hide a giggle as she watched him groan in pain, but that didn’t change anything.“Hey,” she said, tapping on the stranger’s shoulder, “that was my husband you punched.” She wasn’t fully sure what her plan was here, she couldn’t exactly use magic on the muggle, especially with all of these witnesses, so she was sort of screwed if this turned into a fight.The guy looked unimpressed, tilting his sunglasses to the bottom of his nose as he examined her. “Really? That guy? You’re far too good for him. That guy’s an ass.”Well that was forward... She turned back to look at her husband, just as he shoved a waiter -who was trying to help stop the blood flow- away, and then she turned back to look at this strange man.“Fair point, I suppose I can let you off this time. You got a name?”“Hmmm, some call me Handsome, some call me Genius. I’ll let you pick.” He was immediately interested in the hot red head before him, she really has no clue who I am does she? She gave him an unamused brow as she sat down on the stall next to him.“I’m Tony, and you are?”“Lily.”“Lily, I like that. Can I buy you a drink, flower?”“Just Lily. And yes that would be nice.”~~~~~ August 10thTony pulled up outside the house in the quiet, suburban cul-de-sac, examining it with a keen eye. This w
