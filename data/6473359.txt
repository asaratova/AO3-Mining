Barnes’s daemon has a name, obviously, but he only ever calls her “Sweetheart”. At least, Sam’s fairly sure no daemons named their kid that in the 1910s, but hey, what does he know, maybe it was like the kids who used to get named after weird virtues and vices back in the Puritan days; maybe she’s lucky not to be Chastity or Prudence or Bread-of-Life. 
Steve never calls her Sweetheart, though. He doesn’t call her anything at all, admittedly, but that might have more to do with the fact that she hides whenever he comes in the room. Pretty impressively effectively, considering she’s the biggest damn Siberian Husky Sam’s ever seen, daemon or not. “Sweetheart” is a hulking black-and-white beast, gorgeous as hell with mismatched eyes, one blue and one brown, and both maddeningly penetrating. Sam’s used to being ignored by other people’s daemons outside of the occasional especially brutal fight; Sweetheart doesn’t ignore anything, much less a full-grown adult human in the same room as her. 
She and Barnes are separated, he knows, because Barnes kicked him off a helicarrier while she was already halfway to Steve. Or, well--he hopes they’re separated. 
They don’t actually go too far from each other these days. 
They don’t actually go too far from him, either, which is a whole ‘nother thing. Redwing was nervous about it at first, but they’d promised Steve and Bernie they’d do this for them and even if they hadn’t, Barnes deserves at least one damn shot to come back to being a decent person. More than that, really, after all the files say happened to him, but Sam’s only got the one shot in him himself. He can’t let Steve burn himself out any worse than that. 
He’s damn sure Steve would try to, though. 
It’s a problem, if Barnes makes it a problem. Otherwise it’s just a possibility. 
So Sam lets Barnes follow him everywhere, and they don’t talk about Sweetheart hiding from Steve or Bucky refusing to look at Bernie. Steve pretends not to notice, but Bernie wilts every time. Sam’s willing to let it ride, but not for much longer. He’s only let it ride this long because the circumstances are so bizarre and awful that there’s really no precedent to go by. 
Seriously, though, there is nothing as sad-looking as a sad honey badger. Nothing. Sam was not previously aware a honey badger could look sad, but Bernie has well and truly proven it.

“She has very dark fur,” Natasha observes once as they watch Barnes and Sweetheart obsessively run and re-run the obstacle course on the gym floor below, her voice neutral and her Liho curled around her neck like fine jewelry or a chokehold. Sam’s not usually prone to much romanticized violence in his metaphors, but Natasha seems to bring it out in people. Or to want people to think she brings it out in them, maybe. Hard to tell, with Natasha. 
“So does Liho,” Sam says, raising an eyebrow at her. There’s something else to what she’s saying, of course--anything Natasha says neutrally has something else to it--but he’s not a mind-reader. If she doesn’t want to tell him, he’s not going to know. 
“Yes,” Natasha says, entirely expressionless as Liho’s claws flex against the Kevlar over her heart. “He does now.”

Redwing and Sam aren’t separated, but they’ve never needed to be as close to each other as most people and daemons do. Which is useful, sometimes. Which is lonely, sometimes. 
Not really lonely, Sam thinks. More like the impression of it. A space where someone could be but isn’t--not necessarily a space where one of them has to be.

“They really can’t handle you, man,” Sam says, taking a sip of his coffee. His Sunday breakfasts with Steve in the common kitchen are one of the only places Barnes and Sweetheart won’t follow him and Redwing, to the point that Redwing’s actually started staying with them instead more often than not. Steve doesn’t look up from the eggs he is doing a very poor job of cooking; mediocre Army training, he guesses. Or maybe somebody else used to do the cooking. Either way, Sam thinks he can safely say it’s been long enough that he should’ve learned himself by now. 
“I know they can’t,” Steve says. Bernie is a sad, sad-looking honey badger by his feet. “I don’t try to keep walking in on them. The complex just isn’t that big.” 
It really is, Sam wants to say, but really the bigger issue is that the places he wants to be and the places Steve wants to be are not especially different, and Barnes is just going by where Sam wants to be. So maybe this one is on him, actually, since no one else’s daemon can seem to bring themselves to leave the room or change course when they at least should be able to tell who’s on the other side of that door. 
Not that he’s surprised, honestly. 
Sometimes Sam wonders what their fight on the last helicarrier was like. Not Steve and Bucky’s--Bernie and Sweetheart’s. Sweetheart had cracked Redwing’s ribs and broken both of his wings and near
