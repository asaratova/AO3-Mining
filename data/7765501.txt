Take me out to the Black

 
“You're gonna come with us.” “Excuse me?” You like ships. You don't seem to be looking at the destinations. What you care about is the ships, and mine's the nicest.” Kaylee grinned as she stood up as the Shepard stopped to look the ship over. “She don't look like much.” “Well, she'll fool ya'. You ever sail in a Firefly?” She walked over, twirling her parasol. “Long before you were crawling. Not an aught three, though. Didn't have the extenders, tended to shake.” “So, uh, how come you don't care where you're going?” “Cause how you get there is the worthier part.” “Are you a missionary?” “I guess... I'm a Shepherd, from the Southdown Abbey. Book, I'm called Book. Been out of the world for a spell. Like to walk it a while, maybe bring the word to them as need it told.” “Well, I'm Kaylee. This is Serenity, and she's the smoothest ride from here to Boros for anyone who can pay.” She paused a beat, worried. “Can you pay, or...?” “Well, I've got a little cash, and, uh...” He picked up a small wooden box from his luggage. He showed her the contents and she went a little bit wide-eyed, eyeing the contents lustfully. “Ooh, grampa...” “I never married.” He argued even as he handed over the money to join them. Kaylee looked around at the sound of someone chuckling to see a guy around her age watching, a bag slung over one shoulder and she smiled. “Looking for a ride?” “Where’re you headed?” He asked, walking closer. “Boros.” She answered as he eyed the ship. Harry studied the ship, taking in the name, Serenity. He’d been there, doing what he could for the wounded on both sides. That battle had been hell and the amount of time it had taken for relief ships to arrive had seriously made him mad. He dug out the money and handed it over to her, getting a grin. “Boros sounds good for now.” He admitted. “Then welcome aboard…?” “Harry Potter, miss.” “I’m Kaylee, mechanic. Is this all your luggage?” “I travel light.” he headed up the ramp to wait in the cargo hold, nodding in greeting to the Shepard. A while later they were joined by a serious, well dressed young man and then another man in travel worn clothes. “Welcome aboard, Mr...” “Dobson.” The travel worn man answered Kaylee. “Dobson!” She grinned. “Thank you.” “We just gotta keep our heads down, do the job, pray there ain't no more surprises.” Mal told Zoe and Jayne as they approached the ship while Wash used the mule to load up a large box. “Please be careful with that.” “Mal, this is Simon. Simon, this is our captain.” Kaylee introduced the two men who sixed each other up. “Captain Reynolds.” Simon greeted. “Welcome aboard.” He turned to Kaylee. “This all we got?” She nodded and he moved into the cargo bay as the passengers stored their luggage. “Now we have a boatful of citizens right on top of our... stolen cargo.” She whispered. “That's a fun mix.” “Ain't no way in the 'verse they could find that compartment, even—“ He cut off as Dobson walked by. “Even if they were lookin' for it.” “Why not?” Mal was thrown by the question. “Cause...?” He offered and she shook her head. “Oh yeah, this is gonna go great.” “If anyone gets nosy, just, you know...shoot 'em.” “Shoot 'em?” “Politely.” Mal answered even as Wash called over the intercom that Inara had docked. He moved towards the controls for the cargo bay doors. “Kaylee, I'm locking it up!” Kaylee looked around once, grabbing her folding chair and parasol. “All aboard...” She whispered before moving in, the doors closing behind her. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Harry stood with the other passengers in the galley as the crew joined them. “Meals are taken up here in the dining area, the kitchen is pretty much self-explanatory, you're welcome to eat what there is any time, what there is, is pretty standard fare, I guess, protein in all the colours of the rainbow. We do have sit-down meals, the next one being at about 1800.” Mal explained, obviously not comfortable speaking to them all like he was. Harry figured Serenity wasn’t usually a passenger ship. “I think Shepherd Book has offered to help me prepare something.” “You're a Shepherd?” “Thought the outfit gave it away. Is it a problem?” “Of course not!” Kaylee denied and then looked at Mal. “It's no problem, 'cause it's not.” “No.” He agreed and then looked to the group again. “As I said, you're welcome to visit the dining area any time. Apart from that, I have to ask you to stay in the passenger dorm while we're in the air. The bridge, the engine room, cargo bay -- they're all off limits without an escort.” “Some of my personal effects are in the cargo bay.” Simon said and Mal nodded. “I figure you all got luggage you're gonna need to get into. Soon as we're done here we'll be happy to fetch 'em with you. Now I have to tell you all one other thing and I apologize in advance for the inconvenien
