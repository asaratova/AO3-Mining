Chapter 1: The Set Up
    




Chapter Text
Tony grumbled, as the bottle pointed at Bruce... for the third time. Chuckling, you shared a knowing look with Natasha, as the two scientists share another quick kiss. The blizzard continued to rage outside, the wind howled and rattled the window panes, whilst a roaring log fire crackled in the hearth. You knew things could be a whole lot worse, especially considering it was only the atrocious weather that had you all grounded; a successful mission to blow up the latest HYDRA base was under your belts, and although the infamous Russian Winter had rolled in, Clint and Natasha had led you to the safe house you were all hunkered down in. So despite being stuck, spirits were high, and everyone was strangely thankful to eat tinned food with crackers, instead of the standard rations you usually had on missions. There was a generous pile of wood stacked to one side of the room, dozens of blankets to snuggle up in, and every surface was crowded with candles. Because even though the hut had running water... hot too, or warm at any rate... it had no electricity. Playing cards had only kept you all entertained for so long, and after one too many gulps of neat Vodka, Tony had suggest Spin the Bottle. With nothing better to do, you'd all agreed... with varying amounts of groaning... but now it seemed even that had run it's course.“How about Seven Minutes in Heaven?” Sam suggested, suddenly.“Have we really sunk so low?” you teased.Clint shrugged. “It could be fun.”Natasha bumped her shoulder against yours. “Odds would be in our favour.”You grinned at your friend; she did have a point... with so many handsome guys to choose from, it did sound rather promising. Besides, it wasn't often the infamous Black Widow let her playful side shine through, she was normally all sass and cryptic smirks. It was nice to see Natasha like this... she seemed younger somehow, so of course you relented and smirking, you turned your attention back to the guys, before gesturing between yourself and Natasha.“We're in.”With your agreement, everyone else quickly followed suit; though Bucky did seem a little nervous, and the two resident Asgardians admitted they didn't understand what the game was, but they were still eager to find out. It promised to be an interesting turn of events. But despite it being Sam's suggestion, Tony took control by liberating a large dish and a tea towel from the kitchenette, and demanding an item from each person to put in the bowl, with the garishly checked towel was used to shield the contents from prying eyes. When it was your turn, you slipped the Avengers keyring from your keys... a joke holiday gift from Tony... and dropped it into the dish. Grinning, Tony took a moment to jiggle the bowl, mixing up the contents before he stepped back into your personal space.“Since you're our newest member, you get the honour of going first,” he chuckled.Smirking, you slipped your hand through the gap that Tony had created by slightly lifting the tea towel, letting you blindly search the dish. You fingertips soon brush over an enticing object, and after tightening your grip, you slowly revealed your prize...
