There is a terrorist cell-- no. Scratch that. Start over.There was a terrorist cell.What there is now, is a lab. It’s not much of one: it’s in the basement of a crumbling warehouse, and the concrete walls are stained. Have been stained, for years, with soot and dirty water and black mold.Now they’re stained with other, redder things.Speaking of red: the woman who steps into the lab is red-headed, bright against the dim and dingy room. She takes in the scene with one sweep of her sharp eyes; she misses nothing. This is what she sees:A gurney, restraints ripped open, and a tray of scalpels and syringes scattered across the floor. A canister, metal, man-sized, its glass door still rimed with frost. And bodies. A lot of bodies. Some are in lab coats; others in military-surplus castoffs; but all of them are equally, efficiently dead.The woman reaches into her pocket and pulls out a phone. You wouldn’t think it would work from below ground, countries away from anywhere she might call home, but it does. “Hill?” she says into the phone, her voice flat. “This is Agent Romanov. We’ve got a situation.”Back in New York, there’s a briefing. Natasha Romanov sits at the table, sharp nails drumming, and waits for everyone to settle themselves. There’s Hill, and Fury, and half-a-dozen agents and analysts with high enough clearance, and to her surprise there is also Captain America. He smiles at her, a quick flash across the table, before the meeting begins.Natasha taps a button, and images flicker to life above the table. It’s the lab, the canister, the bodies, a map. “I’ve been tracking a Ten Rings splinter cell across Eastern Europe. They had cash, but not much in the way of competence. Rumor had it they were looking to buy weapons, and a former Red Room operative was in the area looking to sell. I thought I was in time to intercept the buy-off, but I got there after they opened their present, and found this.” She gestures to the images.“They bought-- what? A body in cryo?” Maria Hill looks skeptical. “How’d one guy fresh out of the ice kill a whole room?”“There are a few possibilities,” Natasha says, and the corners of her mouth flick down. “None of them are good. There aren’t a lot of organizations that have good cryo tech, and the Red Room was always head of the class. They’ve had it for decades, and they liked to keep their best operatives on ice between missions.” She looks down at the table. “And there’s one in particular who hasn’t surfaced since the Red Room fell apart. Someone better than any of their other agents.”Fury huffs a laugh. “You’re not talking about--”“Yes. The Winter Soldier.” She can see the skepticism on every face but the Captain’s. On his, there’s only honest puzzlement.“Okay,” he says, “for the benefit of those of us who’ve been frozen for seventy years, the Winter Soldier is?”“A myth,” Fury answers. “A ghost. Not, in fact, a real person.”“Oh, he’s real enough,” Natasha says, allowing herself a small smile. “He had a hand in training me. Or someone they called Winter Soldier did, anyway.”“You never told me that,” Fury says, fixing her with a stare.“It was never relevant before,” Natasha says. “But it means I might be able to track him, and I know his face.”“But who is he?” the Captain asks again.It’s Hill who answers. “A Soviet operative, or a series of operatives, with an unparalleled ability to blend in. Especially in the US. He’s supposedly behind a string of assassinations throughout the Cold War, but there’s less than no proof tying him to anything real.”“He’s supposed to be the Red Room’s masterwork,” Fury picks up. “So good, they kept him in cryo between missions so he wouldn’t be wasted on aging. But he hasn’t been heard from in twenty years.”“Which would make sense, if he’s been on ice the whole time,” Natasha says evenly. “And if they got the protocols wrong when they thawed him out, if they didn’t reprogram him the right way--”“Then he could have lost it, killed everyone, and made a run for it,” Hill finishes. “And now he’s on the loose with his brains scrambled and no idea what year it is. That’s not good.” She sets her mouth in a flat line, her eyes troubled.“It’s not ideal, no,” Natasha says. “But there’s a positive. Without a mission, with his programming breaking down, the Soldier’s vulnerable. And if his memory hasn’t been wiped, he may remember me; I might be able to get inside his defenses long enough to take him down.”Fury frowns. “You think you can handle it alone? Barton’s on assignment.”“I’ll call for backup if I need it,” Natasha says. “But I think I’ve got it.”The meeting adjourns, and the Captain lingers while Natasha’s packing up her things. “Are you sure you want to go alone?” he asks, real concern in his voice. It’s sweet, if misplaced. “I mean, I wouldn’t mind-- it’s not like I have anything much to do.”“I was wondering why you came to this briefing,” she says.Steve shrugs his big shoulders. “They’re not giving me much in the way of actual work, and Tony sa
