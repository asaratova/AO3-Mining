Work Text:
Steve Rogers Might Wear Tights, but He's Not Your Pin-Up Girl is a story by what-alchemy, inspired by RosaLui's art in the summer 2014 Avengers Reverse Big Bang. Both story and art are contained in the PDF. It is recommended that you experience this collaboration on a computer screen or tablet rather than on a mobile phone. This work is about 5000 words. If you enjoy it and the spirit moves you, comments are gratefully accepted here on AO3, where both artist and author can be notified of them. Thanks very much, and happy reading.RosaLui also made a fanmix, which can be found here on 8tracks and here as a direct download.
