Chapter 1



Notes:
Edit: The site I used for flower meanings no longer exists but if you pay attention each flower's meaning is stated in text as they appear.




Chapter Text
Every child, without fail, is born with a mark, a swirl of color that takes the shape of a perfectly formed blossom nestled directly over their hearts and echoed on their right wrists.Twin blooms etched into their skin by some kind of cosmic force.Heart-flowers, they’re called, those first blossoms to be etched on a person’s skin, the ones gifted to them at the moment of birth no matter what.  More flower-marks can follow in time, depending on a person’s life, but the heart-flower pair is always the first.The thing is, no one knows what causes them.  No one knows where they come from or why they show up.  No one really remembers how their meanings were divined, just that they were.  It doesn’t really matter though because even if there weren’t classes and books and studies done on the meanings people would still know.Somehow people can always tell what the marks mean, what they stand for even, without being told.It’s a universal language, a shared constant of sorts, and everyone knows that the heart-flower, beyond the other flower-marks a person might gain during their lives, is always the most important.The heart-flower is the one that speaks the loudest, the one that represents just who a person is deep inside.So when Anthony Stark is born with a large clump of yarrow flowers etched into his skin directly over his heart and mirrored on his right wrist, the petals red as blood and the centers little sunbursts of yellow, there’s a deathly kind of quiet in the delivery room.No one, not even the Howard Stark, wants a child with war in his heart.~~~Unlike most people Tony’s heart-flower isn’t alone for long, his first flower-mark shows up by the time he’s a year old.A sprig of tiny, delicate white walnut flowers etch their way onto the skin behind his right ear with a frigid kind of burn.  A ball of crimson sycamore blossoms find their way onto the skin behind his left not ten seconds later.His intellect and curiosity etching themselves in turns across his skin for the entire world to see.~~~Neither Howard with his grandeur filled ash blossom, nor Maria with the magnificent beauty of her calla flower, because they’ve never been Father and Mother, not for him, not for Tony, have much to do with him as he grows.The most they do is shove a thick leather band at him to cover his wrist and make sure he knows just how much trouble he’ll be in if he lets anyone see his heart-flower.It doesn’t take him long to realize that, to know with a deep kind of certainty, that they don’t particularly care for him.By the time he’s four, his first circuit board in hand and a freshly slammed door in his face, Tony knows it for truth.The freshly blossomed yew flower that burns its way onto his rib cage is proof of his sorrow.~~~He’s six when Howard shoves a tumbler of scotch into his hand and tells him to drink.Tells him it’ll put hair on his chest.Tells him it’ll make a man out of him.Tony doesn’t want to be a man, he just wants to build, wants to create, wants to be Tony.He drinks it anyway though because he’s also still desperate for Howard’s approval.  For Howard’s anything.The vibrant red hand flower that burns its way into existence underneath the sorrow of his yew blossom is a warning all on its own.~~~He builds his first engine at seven but it isn’t good enough for Howard.Nothing ever is.The small white syringa flower he finds later on that night nestled beside the yew and hand flowers is to be expected.  Disappointed expectations are their own kind of pain after all.~~~Tony tells Howard he doesn’t want to build weapons one day.  He tells him that he wants to make robots, wants to make planes and computers and a million other useful things.He doesn’t want to hurt people.  Instead he wants to be a hero, like Captain America and his Commandos.Howard’s ring splits his lip and Tony tastes blood seconds later, thick and heavy in his mouth, bitter and biting on his tongue just like the scotch had been.“You’ve got war in your heart boy,” Howard sneers, “don’t ever try and pretend to be anything but what you are.”Tony feels the familiar burn of a flower mark being etched into his skin but he doesn’t look, doesn’t try and check to see what it is.  Instead he keeps his eyes on Howard and his hands cupped around his bleeding mouth and nose.He’s young but he’s smart and Tony knows better than to take his eyes off of a predator.~~~Later that night is when he finds it.A Judas flower has burnt its way onto the skin beneath his right underarm and Tony isn’t even sure why.You have to have faith in someone to be betrayed in the first place.~~~Citron flowers woven between cardamine and morning glory vines settle across the tops of his shoulders like a cape by the time he’s nine.  A garland of sadness woven between paternal error and extinguished hopes for all the world
