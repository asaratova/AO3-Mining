Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter Parker stares vacantly at the ceiling as occasional lights from outside reflect in through the window. His ceiling. His window. He wasn’t used to those statements yet.  He and May had arrived back in Queens from Wakanda a week ago. Well technically Peter did. Shortly after Tony moved up the Glasgow Coma scale by actually being alert with eye tracking and basic movements, Aunt May took that as a sign that it was time for her to come back and get things set up. Happy had come back with her. He helped her find an apartment in a building near the Parker's old place. Helped her get the Parker family stuff out of storage that the Starks kept for them. Helped her go out and get her first desk job too.  Happy came back a week later saying he was supposed to bring Peter back to Queens. That he needed to prep for the start of the new school year coming up in a matter of two weeks. Peter didn’t want to leave Tony, but the doctors said he was safe to move to his lake house so long as a medical personal are present to monitor him and help him recover. Pepper wanted to get home. She had Stark Industries after her to come back, Morgan was crying more about wanting to go home, and the argument was made that Tony’s recovery would speed up more once he got home.   Tony spent a lot of time sleeping still but when he was awake he was able to have small and simple conversations with those around him which was quite a recovery from being a vegetable a week before. It was one of those alert moments that Tony was having as everyone began to load up on the planes. Alert enough to call Peter to his side and squeeze the teen’s hand and pull him into a hug.  “See yah soon kid,” he spoke into Peter’s ear before letting go. With one last wave to Ms. Potts and a hug to Morgan, who cried and told Peter he needed to come home with them which thankfully Ms. Potts addressed, Peter boarded a different plane from the Starks to head back to Queens.   Now a week after that day, Peter lays staring at the unfamiliar ceiling surrounded by half unpacked boxes and wondering if he’ll ever fall asleep.  Listening closely he could hear his aunt’s even breathing indicating she’s asleep in the next room over. Quietly the teen gets up and reaches into his half opened closet door. Pulling out his first spiderman uniform from Tony, he slips it on rather then the iron spider. The nano tech swirls in its case on the floor charging. He would use it but that last incident of nearly peeing himself is still strong.  Peter dons the mask and slips out the window onto the fire escape, webbing the next building and taking flight.  “Hello Peter,” the feminine voice echoes in the mask. “Hey Karen, good to hear from you.” “Yes, it is good to hear from you too Peter. I have no new messages but I do have alerts from F.R.I.D.A.Y.” “Oh?” Peter didn’t expect that. He thought the Stark family would be to busy with Tony’s recover that Peter wouldn’t hear from anyone over there for---well probably a long time. Even F.R.I.D.A.Y reaching out was unexpected to the teen.  Peter stops swinging around Queens, resting on a random roof. “Go ahead Karen.”  “F.R.I.D.A.Y has kept me updated with Mr. Stark’s recovery. It seems two days after arriving home he began to make attempts at getting up out of bed and was on semi-solid foods. By the fourth day he was able to stay awake for most of the day with small amounts of activity and was able to walk around the lower floor of the house with a mobility aid. The most recent update has Mr. Stark walking with a cane, eating regularly with only a few dietary restrictions, and practicing taking the stairs of his home. He so far has shown no hearing, visual, or speech difficulties. He does tire quickly sometimes while other times he struggles to sleep.”
Peter chuckles, “I know that feeling. Karen who told F.R.I.D.A.Y to give me these updates?”  The AI was silent for a moment before responding. “According to F.R.I.D.A.Y Miss Morgan Stark said ‘tell my big brother how daddy’s doing because he will be worried.’ Mr. Stark’s AI connected that she was most likely talking about you.” Peter smiled behind the mask. Morgan was right, he did worry.  “Hey Karen, can you tell F.R.I.D.A.Y to let Morgan know I’m really grateful for the updates.” “Yes I can Peter. Would you like to scan for crime right now Peter? Because if so, I’ll have to report that you are out fighting crime past your curfew.” Peter sighed. He should probably stop crime since he’s awake. But he didn’t want to find out what happens if the ‘out past curfew’ alert goes off. Will Tony even know since he’s at the lake house? He also was tired. So tired he wanted to lay down and sleep but yet unable to relax enough to reach the point of falling into dreamland. “Hey Karen, would it make me a bad person to just swing around and not stop crime?” The AI was silent for a moment. “I do not believe so Peter. I’ve scanned you and found your body is not in top shape and you’re
