Chapter 1: Scott
    




Chapter Text
Scott wasn’t one to focus on relationships of the other Avengers. He was there to train alongside them as the Accords were amended and all the rogues could return home once more.He didn’t argue too much with the regime. He liked to focus and his hand-to-hand combat had dramatically increased to the point he felt more confident in his abilities. Scott tried to ignore the fact that he was still bested by the spider brat (Spider-Man) but noticed that the Spider could take on Captain America with ease.So he wasn’t too upset about it.Scott had pushed thoughts about aside Spider-Man for the time being. He was elusive and rarely seen at the compound or tower really. While they were all curious about the vigilante they agreed to not look into the guy and respected his privacy as he respected theirs. It was courteous as the guy never seemed to question them despite the curiosity and questions they knew he had for them.Scott admired the vigilante because of that.Not everyone could keep to that level of dedication of secrecy about their identity either.Scott was walking down one of the many corridors of the Compound before turning the corner and running into another body.Scott stumbled slightly and shook his head. “Sorry, sorry. I should’ve been paying attention.” He looked over at the person who he ran into and was taken aback by the sight of a teenager in front of him. The teen’s wide brown eyes reminded him so much of Tony Stark that it was almost even more surprising. “Oh…Um…”“No, it’s alright, sir.” The teenager spoke up, a flush settling on his neck. “I shouldn’t been paying attention more so as well. I was just messaging one of the other Stark Industries interns over the project we’re working on.” He finished though he sounded breathless and Scott wondered how he managed to even breathe through that ramble. “You’re Ant-Man.” He managed to gasp out.Scott’s mind focused on one point (though he felt pride bubble up in his chest that the kid knew who he was) and tilted his head out of curiosity. “You’re an intern? You look…” He paused and studied the kid. He knew he was a teenager and because of his own child he knew that the teenager was more adult than kid. “You look like you’re fifteen. Doesn’t Stark Industries only accept college students or are you actually in college?”The teenager paused and shook himself out of his shocked stupor. “Uh…I’m sixteen actually. Still in high school even though I could be in college.” He chuckled awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck as the colour crept up his neck and to his cheeks and ears. Seems like his intelligence is something he doesn't like to brag about - nice. “I actually got the internship out of sheer luck. Stark Industries found me, took an interest in me and Mr Stark sort me out personally. About a year ago now.”“Ah.” Scott nodded. During the time the Avengers were broken up, no wonder they hadn't heard about him yet.The teenager shifted on his feet before blurting out. “I’m Peter Parker, sir. I’m still sorry about running into you. Really, I’m usually a lot more focused on my surroundings than that.”“It’s alright, Peter.” Scott grinned. “Scott Lang, Ant-Man as you seem to know.”“Of course I know.”Scott blinked in shock before Peter blushed and ducked his head. “Okay.” He laughed loudly. “Anyway, what are you doing here, kid?”Peter looked startled as he looked around. “Oh. I was just getting some food before going to meet a few interns in one of the labs.” He grinned brightly up at Scott before looking down at his phone and letting out a yelp. “Shit! I’m late!”He shot another smile at Scott before rushing past him. “See ya, Mr Lang! Sorry but I really gotta go.”Scott didn’t even get the chance to say ‘bye’ before Peter had disappeared down the hallways. He watched him go and felt like there was a niggling feeling in his mind about Peter.Did he recognise him from somewhere?That voice was familiar.He shook his head.Nah. He was probably just imagining it. Scott didn’t know many teenagers after all and therefore he could just be lumping voices together.So, Scott had forgotten all about the mysterious intern.That was until he saw Tony talking with said intern. Both seemed very ingrained with a conversation that was hushed though it looked as though the kid was on the verge of chatting loudly and excitedly. He waved his hands around, gestures that meant nothing to Scott but seemed to be something Tony understood with ease.Scott never took Tony Stark as a guy to interact with people, let alone teenagers.Let alone look very invested in whatever Peter was saying.It was intriguing and Scott wanted to observe for a little longer but he needed to speak to Tony about a few things. That meant he should probably interrupt this conversation. A part of his mind whispered at him to not interrupt and that it wasn’t all that important anyway.“Tony!” He called out to him and drawing the attention of both people, they turned their heads towards him.
