Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter Parker swung along the streets of New York, the glowing windows of the skyscrapers a blur in his peripheral vision.  He released his web strand for just a moment, letting his momentum carry him into a double flip before he fired another strand.  It hit the next building and the line went taut as he whizzed down the street.  The web-slinger let the web carry him high into the air before he released the line again and he launched himself high enough to clear the next rooftop and land lightly on the edge.The superhero settled on the lip of the roof and looked out over the bustling streets.  “Street crime is down, all the major players are laying low or in jail, no new psychos have shown up in almost a month…”  He relaxed and let his legs hang over the edge.  “Looks like a quiet night.  Which means I’m probably due for a major catastrophe any day now.”  He sighed and absently rolled his shoulders as a soft, almost sickeningly sweet scent drifted through the air.  Suddenly, he felt the hair on the back of his neck sticking up and a very familiar tingling at the back of his head.  “I had to say it.”  I jumped to his feet as the scent thickened and a cloud of pinkish fog seemed to seep out of the stones at his feet.  Then something clicked and he recognized the familiar swirl of mist.“Good evening Spider-man.”  The fog parted in front of him and a large web-like throne appeared, with an elderly woman sitting regally on it.“Madame Web.  It’s been a while since you paid me a visit.  Here to deliver some cryptic wisdom?”The elderly psychic actually smiled.  “In a sense.  I come to give you a warning of a sort.”Peter’s shoulders slumped.  He really didn’t need this right now.  “Business as usual then.”Web nodded and raised one of her hands.  The fog spiraled above her, before parting to reveal a massive web, glowing with golden light.  “I hardly need to explain the concept of the multiverse to you, do I Mr. Parker?”“I get the general idea,” Peter deadpanned.  He’d been to more than enough alternate universes, timelines, and pocket dimensions to know the concept.Web nodded again and waved a hand again.  “This is the Web of Fate, a sort of representation of the bindings that hold all realities together.  Every strand representing a bond between worlds, and every intersection another reality.  In fact, ours is right here.”  She pointed right to the middle of the web.  “Now, tell me what you see.”Peter hopped up to the top of the throne, looking over the glowing strands.  “So we’re the center of the universe and…”  He trailed off as he examined the threads around central axis.  They seemed to be growing shorter, each of the small intersections being pulled in closer to the center.  “Oh.  That’s bad.”“Bad or good, I really can’t say.”  Spider-man spun around to see the psychic now hovering a few feet behind him rather than sitting below him.  “This is not the first time that I’ve seen worlds come together.  Worlds merging and separating is simply one of many phenomena that I have observed watching the ebbs and tides of many worlds.  But I have never seen our world drawn so close to so many others.”Peter turned and squatted down on top of the throne.  “So what?  We’re about to get some uninvited guests from another world?”“If only it were that simple.  At the rate these worlds are drawing closer, they will begin to mingle with our own.  Eventually, they will become part of it.  Indistinguishable from what always was to all but a select few.”“Let me make a wild guess,” the hero interrupted.  “Me and you?”“You, certainly,” the fortune teller replied.  “Myself… I cannot say.  I am not entirely certain that I will remain as I am when this world becomes something new.”Peter tensed up.  “How long to we have?”“Minutes, at best.”The hero just shook his head.  “You could have warned me a little bit sooner you know.”  He flipped off the top of the seat and landed on what passed for the ground in Madame Web’s psychic projection.“If I had known, I would have.”  The psychic walked back over to the throne and sat down again.  “It has been a pleasure to work with you, Spider-man.”Peter crossed his arms.  “You know, I’m actually going to miss your cryptic hinting.”Madame Web smiled.  “If I do not see you again, I will miss you too.”The fog began to boil around them as the strands drew tighter and tighter.  Peter looked up at the web and finally raised a hand to try to ward off the swirling fog.  There was a rush of air and suddenly he was standing back on the rooftop in downtown Manhattan.  The hero looked around for a few moments, taking in the busy city streets.  “Well, Doctor Doom hasn’t taken over the world and everyone has the right number of body parts.”  He fired a web down to the next building and leaped into the empty air.  “Let’s go see what’s what.”He felt the air rush by his face and the tug of gravity in his gut before the web snapped tight and his momentum carried him forward.  The city seemed
