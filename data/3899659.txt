Chapter 1: The silver haired boy
    




Chapter Text
“You… you should have done better…”
Those were his words. As if they had been uttered just a moment before, they kept resounding in (y/n)’s head: over and over like the beat of a drum.
“I should have saved him” were the only coherents thoughts in her mind.
She looked at him again. The vision of his lifeless body and  his gaze lost in the sky became blurred… He was her brother…
(Y/n) buried her head in her trembling hands and rocked back and forth. She was unable to speak, unable to breath, unable to think… There was nothing inside her… The world around became a blur of colours that melted to gray. The weight in her chest and locks in her throat were unbearable…
“Clint…” she whispered, “you can’t die…” her voice broke at that point. Her brother was not going to get up. He was death.
She lay down next to him, her gaze lost in the same sky.
“Don’t leave me, Clint” she cried.

“Stop it, Wanda”, said the silverly-blonde haired boy.
Wanda looked at him, confused, while her hands still surrounded (y/n)’s head, reddish energy emanating from them.
“… you can’t die…” (y/n)’s voice cracked.
Her low pray clutched at Pietro’s heart. He observed that girl suffering, her eyes filled with pain…
“Stop it, Wanda!” he yelled, but the Scarlet Witch continued manipulating (y/n)’s mind.
“Well, you didn’t seem to care when I did the same to the other Avenger… Romanov…”
Pietro kneeled next to his sister and (y/n).
“What is her vision about?”
“It's her worst nightmare: her brother dying. By the way, his brother is Hawkeye” she informed as more reddish flames entered in (y/n)’s head, “So, if I were you, I would be careful when asking her out” she said cheekily.
Pietro took hold of one of her sister’s hand and moved it away from (y/n). Red energy vanished from them while Wanda looked at him surprised.
“Why are you  making her see that? She must be going through a lot of pain right now!”
“For god’s sake, Pietro! She’s an Avenger! She’s in their side! She’s in Stark’s side!” But, as she spoke, she saw suffering in her brother’s eyes.
“Even if she’s not in our side, she doesn’t deserve to see her brother dying” he said meaningfully.
Pietro took one of (y/n)’s hands. They were cold, and her eyes were still fixed in a far away point. She breathed heavily.That was the first time Pietro was so close to her. He had seen her before, when the Avengers broke into the building to stop Ultron from getting the vibranium. In that moment, which had just happened half an hour ago, she stood behind Stark and Hawkeye, her brother.And the first time their eyes met, his heart began pumping madly.She had an air of carefree confidence, noticeable in her (e/c) eyes, that moved around the place, inspecting it. She had a serene but fierce look in her soft face. Her long and (h/c) hair spilled down between her shoulders wildly, with some locks caressing the skin of her collar bone.
Her thin pink lips curved into a half smile as she looked at him. She had noticed how he had been studying her features. Her look was still fierce but curious as she winked at him. Pietro smirked. Definetly, that girl was (y/n).
Ultron had already informed them about her. She also had powers, like them. She was dangerous, but unexperienced. Her weak point was her brother and team mates, for whom she deeply cared (and viceversa).In addition, as he had seen some minutes ago, she was a formidable fighter.
And she had an unnerving effect on him, which he tried to push aside so that he could focus on the fight.In that moment, she was there, lying on the floor. When Pietro touched her hand, he felt a tingling sensation throughout his body.
Her breath was going back to a normal pace.
___________________________________(Y/n)  blinked several times. She wasn't with his brother anymore.Just some centimetes away from her face, two electric blue eyes where gazing intensely at her.
She blinked again, surprised. Suddenly, she realised of her situation:  the vision of her brother’s death was just that, a vision. The Maximoff girl. She had done it, and right in front of her was the other Maximoff twin, Pietro, who was looking… Worried? How could he be worried? Why hadn’t he attacked her yet?
The silver haired boy grinned cheekily at (y/n).
“Like what you see?” he said in a soft voice with his strong accent.
He was holding her hand and she could feel her heart throb.Pietro Maximoff... She had seen him half an hour ago. While she inspected the building, she noticed his look. He was probably  trying to discover any weak point or reassuring his tactics against her. When she met his look intentionally, she couldn’t help to notice his breath-taking blue electric eyes, partially covered by some silver hair locks. His finely toned body along with his smirk attempted to melt her heart, but she set aside her strange and sudden feelings. She smiled at Pietro, challenging him with a fierce look.
“If that’s his tactic, it won’t bee
