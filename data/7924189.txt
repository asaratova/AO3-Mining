Chapter Text
 PastWhile it was known that Hank Pym and Howard Stark were acquaintances, few knew how good friends Janet and Maria were. Both wives of famous inventors and entrepreneurs, the two instantly connected in a party and created a friendship that the two depended on.The two women got to know each other better through science and organizing charities to encourage women in STEM fields. They grew immensely close to each other, considering themselves as sisters rather than friends.Howard had Peggy and Jarvis, while Maria had Janet.Maria knew exactly what Howard and the Pyms were part of. So when Tony was born, Janet was with her when Howard wasn’t. She cried while Janet held her hand as she learned that Howard was compromised. Hank and other agents were out rescuing, while Janet stayed behind with Maria and Tony.Tony was so beautiful, with big brown eyes that stared at Janet.“He’s your godson,” Maria whispered to her. Janet stared at her, holding Tony in her arms and promised this little boy the happiness he deserved.…..PresentRhodey was worried. He hasn’t heard anything from Tony so far since he got up from the hospital. All he knew was that Tony had gone to RAFT and then he couldn’t be tracked. It’s been hours and even Vision doesn’t know Tony is. Natasha isn’t even here either.“Rhodey!”He looked up from his bed to see Hope and Pepper by the door, as they rushed in to be beside him. Pepper was crying openly while Hope seemed to control herself. “We came as soon as we could,” Hope starts to say but Rhodey interrupts her.“Did Tony contact you?”“He did,” Hope said, as the two women sat down. “He said what happened to you and where you were. I am so sorry for what Scott did-““Listen Hope,” Rhodey interrupts her again, his worry and annoyance turning into one. “Did Tony tell you where he was going? Or contact you again.”“No,” Hope replied with a confused look, not understanding where he was going. Then it hit her. Tony would have never left Rhodey right now, unless something big had happened.“I know he went to the RAFT and then nothing,” Rhodey tells, panicking. Pepper holds his hand, whispering comfort words but the damage is already done. Nurses come in and shoo the women out of the room and stabilize Rhodey. Pepper wordlessly hugs the younger woman in the hallway, both too worried about what is going on and where the hell is Tony.“Miss Potts?”They turn to see Vision, standing awkward in the hallway. “I know where Mr. Stark is.”…..PastTony was six when he first met Hope. She was a baby and Mama had told him to be careful around her. Aunt Janet was in the bed, looking tired but happy as Mama was holding the baby in her arms.“Mama can I hold her?” Tony asks. Mama looks at Aunt Janet who nods with a smile. Mama carefully explains how to hold a baby, and hovers behind him as he holds the little girl named Hope.“Hello Hope,” Tony whispers. “I am Tony, your god brother.”He doesn’t noticed the soft smiles Janet and Maria share.…..Present“I am going with you.”Pepper sighs as Hope and Vision continue to argue. Hope wants to go to Siberia while Vision retaliates with Hope hadn't signed the accords, thus not able to come with him.But why would Tony go to Siberia? Pepper thought.“For God’s sake,” Pepper interrupted their argument. “Both of you go. Tony might need all the help right now. Hope, did you bring the suit?”Hope nods and turns to Vision. “Like it or not I am going with you.”The android didn’t comment but nods anyway. Right now they didn’t have time to fight when Mr. Stark could be in danger.Pepper swiftly turns to Hope and kisses her goodbye. “Be safe and get him back,” Pepper whispered.Hope nodds in determination and followed Vision.…..Past“Tony!”Tony just turned in time to catch Hope as they both crashed to the ground, the girl laughing her ass off. He holds on to her, the strawberry smell easing his tired heart. “Did you miss me?” Hope asks, her brown eyes filled with innocence. He pulls her up but the girl doesn’t let him go. The five-year-old hangs onto him and Tony missed her too much.He looks over to see his mother and Aunt Janet talking to themselves, his mama’s worried face as Aunt Janet tried to comfort her. He knows why his mother is worried and sad.He is going to boarding school. He doesn’t want to, and his mama doesn’t want him to go, but his father is adamant.“Are you okay Tony?”He turns to the small girl and kisses her forehead. He can do this. He has to do this.“Of course I am, now that my formichina is with me.”…..PresentThey land the quinjet away from the location. Hope gives the android a nod as she minimizes herself. She flies ahead, knowing that Vision will be at her side the moment trouble will start. The location was in the middle of nowhere, but why would Tony go there. 'it doesn’t matter for now,' Hope thinks to herself as she carefully enters the abandoned building. She swiftly goes th
