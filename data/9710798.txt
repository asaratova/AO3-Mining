Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Harry winced at the state of his hands. His whole body was crying in pain, but he refused to let the tears fall. He couldn’t let his uncle see the state of his weakness, knowing that Vernon would take the opportunity to abuse him further, verbally or physically.With every breath he took, his ribs groaned in pain, his legs stretched carefully as he made his way to the broken floorboard that held his precious positions: his wand, cloak, and muggle medical supplies. Harry reached for the medical box, carefully disinfecting his bleeding hands, stifling a cry of pain in his shoulder. With shaking hands, Harry wrapped them in white bandages, quickly becoming red from the blood.From her cage, Hedwig hooted sadly. Harry looked up at her, his Avada eyes bright with tears, but a small smile on his face. He stood up, extending his left pinky, the only finger that did not sustain injury from his beating, to rub against her white feathers without staining her pristine coat.“Tomorrow, we leave this place,” he whispered to her reverently. “You don’t deserve this,” He said, a silent tear falling from his bruised eye at the thought of Hedwig being put through such pain every day. He would take a thousand beatings from his uncle, aunt, and cousin before he let a single beating be subjected to his familiar.“Hedwig,” Harry said after a moment of the two of them gazing out the barred window that his uncle fixed, “we are never coming back here.” He promised. The half-moon was the only thing that illuminated his room, not being allowed a light source. “I don’t care what it takes,” he promised to her, his voice a mixture of anger and desperation, chin quivering under the burden of weakness. “I will be a slave no longer,” Harry said, Hedwig brushing her head against his finger.Harry weakly smiled, another tear falling from his bruised eye and burning his split lip. Harry licked the wound, thinking about how he got it, and making it worse in the best and, inevitably, worse way, as he pulled his hand away from her and made his way to the bed.Without noise, Harry lay on the bed, one of his fingers touching his lips, remembering the other that fell on his.
The boy was older than Harry was by two years. He was taller than Harry, a muggle, and had longer brown hair. He sat next to Harry on the swing set the first day Harry met him. The boy said nothing to Harry that first day.

Harry became uncomfortable in his presence and left after five minutes. 

That was the beginning of the summer. None of his friends had contacted him over the holiday like they promised, leaving Harry alone to the abuse that his ‘family’ subjected to him. 

The next day, Harry was told by the boy his name was Alex. Harry replied by just saying his own name. Alex smiled at Harry kindly, stood from his own swing and walked behind Harry. Harry thought he was leaving once he got his name, being further humiliated by doing something as stupid as trusting someone. Harry was wrong. 

Alex began to push him on the swing. Harry was so surprised, he flinched violently, almost falling off the plastic seat, but Alex caught him gently, rebalancing him, then rocked the swing set gently with no words exchanged between them. 

For the first two months, Alex and Harry barely talked, but Harry found it nice to have someone near him that didn’t know him as ‘freak’ or ‘the boy who lived.’ When Alex saw his bruises on his arms, he left. Harry felt so alone, rejected and more like a freak than ever for being comforted by a random boy. 

But Alex returned with a muggle medical kit. Again, no words were exchanged as Alex bandaged him. 

Harry didn’t know if Alex told his family about Harry, but no one came to help him from his uncle. Harry didn’t ever thank Alex for fixing his wounds. 

Two nights ago, his aunt slapped him across the face, his lip caught on her wedding ring and split his lip. He fixed it as best as he could, continuing with his slave tasks, before going out to the swing set. 

Alex came up to him, smile on his face and said,

“Want me to kiss it to make it better?” Harry shot his head up in surprise, giving Alex enough time to lean in and kiss his wound. Frozen at the foreign feeling, Alex took the time to swipe his tongue over the wound, opening it. Harry pulled away, confused at the feelings consuming him. 
What resulted from that kiss was an awkward silence. Alex apologized, thinking that Harry was gay for Harry to say that he was in a rush to try and avoid more awkwardness, then he rambled that he thought of Alex as a friend.He and Alex parted, Harry not telling him that he would be away for the rest of the year.When he got to the Dursley residence, (never home,) Vernon pulled him into the house with a smug looking Dudley and a disgusted Petunia. His hands received the blunt of the blows. Sometime over the last school year, Vernon got it into his thick head that if he beat Harry’s hands, he could break the freak out of him.Harry knew that h
