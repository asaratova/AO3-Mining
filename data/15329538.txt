Chapter 1: Maria Collins Carbonell
    




Chapter Text
‘Again, sir?’ Jarvis asked, with something like exasperation.‘Oops?’ Howard offered with only the minimum amount of assumed repentance.Jarvis sighed. ‘Sir, there is only a finite number of young women qualified to undertake the duties of a secretary to yourself. You cannot keep on seducing them into your rooms.’‘Oh, so they’re all my fault?’ Howard asked with a slight pout. ‘You do realise that some of them come onto me in this very office.’Jarvis balked. ‘You mean that I need to clean that chair?’Howard looked down at the chair in interest. ‘You mean you don’t clean this chair?’‘I didn’t realise you were cavorting in the chair!’ Jarvis insisted defensively, cheeks flushing.Howard threw his head back and laughed. He stood up. ‘It’s all right, Jarvis. Geez, you need to calm down a bit. I’ve got a meeting to get to. You can clean the chair while I’m gone. Then you can look into getting me a new secretary.’ He picked up his briefcase and walked out of the office, leaving Jarvis to it.Howard strode down the hallway of his office building and stepped into the elevator. As the lift moved, he sighed. With the Korean conflict called to an end (finally!) Howard’s number of military contracts had lessened. Many of them pertained to the conflict so, with its end, Howard was freed up to work on the sort of things he much preferred.One of which was the results his scientific division had come up with. Once the Sarge had found out what’d happened in ’46 with Steve’s blood he’d had pretty much the same reaction as Howard’s cousins. But he’d gone one step further. Seeing as a similar serum had been used on him, the Sarge had rolled up his sleeve and given Howard a blood sample.Dr. Shields was the head doctor commissioned for the experiments with the blood. He’d picked out various other doctors he knew from work and various medical conferences that would have the expertise and the interest in curing the diseases to work on the project. Howard had received a lot of criticism, mostly from his business associates and board members, on the extremity of his security measures around the project. They all insisted it was overkill. Howard spoke to Shields about it.‘More like under-kill,’ Dr. Shields said. ‘Sure, it’s the best technology you can come up with, but this is the most coveted thing in the world right now, if it was publically known about. Super-soldier blood is so rare, it would fetch a mint on the black market. If anyone’s calling your security overkill, either they severely underestimate how valuable the blood is or they want to get their hands on it themselves and the security measures make it impossible.’With that statement, Howard dismissed the issue from his mind. Dr. Shields was right. Already three lab assistants were on the watch list because of things they done or said which left Shields with the feeling they’d like to walk off with the blood, and one man had been fired because he’d tried to pocket the vial of blood and walk out with it.The lift opened and Howard walked out.Immediately, the women in the office turned their attention towards him as he walked through. Howard watched, in his peripheral vision, as several women fluffed their hair, checked themselves, changed the positioning of their clothes on their bodies, or shifted their sitting positions. Women practically threw themselves at his feet.Just once he’d like to meet a woman he had to work for.***Jarvis slipped his spectacles on as he went through the relevant paperwork.The woman was certainly qualified. She’d been recommended by a colleague. Miss Frasier had been very...enthusiastic upon the recommendation of the young blonde lady before him. She was young, certainly. He’d place the girl in her early twenties. A quick glance at the data in front of him told Jarvis that she was, in actual fact, just 21 years old. The information made Jarvis cringe. She was young enough to be naive and gullible but old enough for Mr. Stark to justify it if he did take her to bed.Unfortunately, the final decision was not up to Jarvis. He was only Mr. Stark’s butler. He handled his home and estates. His business, on the other hand, was someone else’s responsibility. Miss Maria Collins Carbonell was hired due to her impressive work record – the sort of precision and efficiency generally seen in one of middle age or late middle age.So Jarvis ended up leading her through the Stark Mansion to Mr. Stark’s home office. He knocked on the door and led her in. ‘Your new secretary, sir.’ He handed Mr. Stark the papers.Mr. Stark looked at the papers first – Jarvis knew he’d oogle her in a moment. ‘Maria Collins Carbonell.’ He lifted his eyes and gave her a smile – the kind of smile he generally reserved for women he found particularly attractive. ‘Two last names? Mind if I ask why that came about?’‘Oh,’ Miss Carbonell said. ‘I was originally born Maria Collins, but my parents died in a car accident when I was a young child.
