When Tony gets his first Imprint, it’s like throwing up- an itch at the back of his throat, then the slow pinching haze behind his eyes; the stumble, and then the surge.He’s six and isn’t experienced with throwing up yet, not like he’s going to be, with sweet tequila going up the same as it goes down- he’s had food poisoning, though, from the fancy restaurant with fancy tables and fancy wallpaper that Howard had made a face at, so that’s what he thinks back to when it happens.He thinks back to the smoothness of the oysters and how they had lumped together in the shiny metal bowl that the maid was holding, slick with his own saliva and the carrots he had to go with them; but the itch, the surge, isn’t in his throat.Instead it’s in his chest, like it’s just under the skin, like spiders playing with his ribs, and Tony turns off the tap with a shaky hand. He rinses his toothbrush and slots it back into the jar, swallowing what’s left of the toothpaste in his mouth. It turns into a thick paste as it goes down, so he has to try a few times before it does.He reaches a hand down to pull up his shirt, holding it up in a dark bunch to his neck.Blink and you miss it:A blue he hasn’t seen even when he went to the museum last week, when Maria had been smiling more genuinely than usual (and Tony’s getting better at that, he’s getting better at telling when people are faking it; when he told her this her smile faltered) and Tony had had his head tipped back and the layered, papery blue of the ocean twisting is nothing compared to the electric blue in his chest.Blink and you miss it- a clear-cut circle, not stretching when his chest comes in and out with his breath, taking up almost all of his chest as it flickers, flickers, and then fades.He holds his breath until his head starts to swim, just in case it comes back.It doesn’t, and Tony is halfway down the hall before realizing that the maid is gone for the night along with Jarvis, and his parents are already asleep by now, so he has no-one to tell until morning.A few weeks later, he finds that his hand keeps coming up to the middle of his chest, curling there reflexively, so he clenches his fingers and makes himself stop.   A nudge from the universe, Steve’s mother calls them, and scoops back her hair- blonde, like his, and the same texture, just shorter- to show him the thorned rose, and the wisp of white on her shoulder when he asks about them.He asks what both of them mean, and doesn’t notice her smile is sad when she says, it’s a long story, Stevie. I’ll tell you later, okay? 
Okay.
Okay, she grins, and makes him squeal when she kisses him hard and repeatedly on the nose. Come on, off to bed with you.Three months after that, Steve’s mother pushes up her sleeve- it’s winter, it’s snowing and she’s shivering- to show him the wisp of white.It’s a bird, she tells him, and there’s something clouding her expression; not loss but almost mirroring it.Steve looks up at it, at the curves that could be eyes but could just be holes. What does it mean?She tells him to go to school, and he gets to ask again three more times in the next year before he forgets why he even wanted to, because her hair keeps coming away when she puts her hand through it.   Tony has a birthday party when he’s thirteen, and no-one from school comes because Howard didn’t buy any alcohol for it, so Tony’s kind of expecting the empty house, anyway.His parents at least have the decency to tell him they’re sorry they can’t be there for his birthday, and Tony doesn’t say much and doesn’t wave them off when they get on the plane.He sits on the couch with his feet tucked up underneath him, and eyes the locked liquor cabinet for a few minutes as he does his homework (easy, too easy, everything’s easy to him except basic human fucking contact and he hates it, hates how he can run rings around professors with PHDs but can’t make one single friend in his boarding school).Howard’s a hypocrite, anyway, he decides as he corrects a mistake the professor made, because he still remembers the slur in Howard’s voice, the vice-grip of his hand on Tony’s small shoulder.Drink this, Howard had said, it’ll put some hair on your chest.He remembers his mother, with the stiff lines near her mouth, saying, Howard, he’s only four-But Howard had barked something back at her and Tony had taken the glass and downed it, wincing when it had burned all the way down, and had almost hacked up a lung coughing from it.Howard had patted his back throughout his coughing, and every impact of Howard’s broad palm on his back only made him cough harder.Tony feels it then, as he’s thinking back to the brunt of Howard’s hand and the heavy glass in his own- the itch, the stumble, then the surge, and he trips over his own feet running across the room to a mirror, yanking up his shirt as he goes.His chest has grown but the Imprint hasn’t, as they never do, and there it is, there’s the blue he hasn’t been able to re-create, there’s the circle of
