Chapter 1: Waking Up
    




Chapter Text
Peter strolled lazily across the lavish living room, the carpet soft against his feet, but causing a slight drag where his pajama pants got caught. The blinds were up, sunlight streaming in from the rising sun through the floor to ceiling windows, Manhattan bustling far below them.Even though he had been out until some ungodly hour last night on patrol, he felt weirdly not like absolute death today. It was a pleasant change.He smelt the delicious aroma of bacon before he even heard the sizzling of the pans and the scrape of a spatula against enamel. The hardwood floors creaked in time with the soft humming that was emanating from the kitchen.With a grin on his face, and a soft grumble of his stomach, he rounded the corner to find Steve. Dressed in a 'Kiss the cook' apron with a picture of Iron Man in a chef hat, courtesy of Tony, and spiderman pajamas, courtesy of Clint, matched with an unnecessarily tall chef hat with the Avengers 'A' on it, courtesy of Bucky, he was a sight to behold. Quickly moving to take a seat at the counter next to Natasha, who was sipping coffee and scrolling through the news on her phone, he grabbed at the plate of pancakes that was stacked high.Successfully snagging one before Steve could turn and whack him with the spatula, he stuffed it into his mouth, cheeks puffed out in an effort to eat it all in one go."Hello маленький паук," Natasha greeted fondly, glancing up to ruffle his hair.Her own now long, red hair was plaited intricately into a rather messy braid that was wound around to form a delicate bun. The hairstyle had obviously been dishevelled by sleep, but when Bucky, Peter, Wanda, Pepper and, on this rare occasion, Clint had done it up it had been gorgeous.He grinned back, mouth too full to reply."Morning kiddo," Steve said cheerily, turning to place a huge plate of bacon next to the pancakes.He grinned and waved in return.He got up to make a cup of hot chocolate and marshmallows that he added cold milk to so that it became,  essentially, a cold drink.It was something the Mother Hen #1, aka Bruce, Mother Hen #2, aka Steve, and even Pepper, hated and consistently told him not to do.Steve glanced at the teenager, holding his Captain America mug in his hands, a small smile on his face, noticing the condensate that formed on the cup and rolled down onto the marble countertop."Peter." He said sternly, causing the boy to startle slightly. "We've had this talk before. Hot drinks in the morning. They're good for you. Cold tea is just gonna mess up your digestion, and cause all kind of problems you'll have to deal with," he reprimanded.Peter nodded mutely, not taking his eyes off the super soldier as he took another sip, causing Steve to roll his eyes and turn back to the eggs he was scrambling.Natasha snickered softly beside him, and reached over to ruffle his hair again."Good morning," Clint chirped suddenly, startling just about no one.Peter glanced up towards the vent above his head to wave at Clint, who was dangling upside down."You should fall," Natasha said, not glancing up or otherwise acknowledging his presence."You should fall," he mocked childishly, moving his hand and body with each syllable, as if he were 5 years old.Natasha rolled her eyes, a slight smirk lighting her features."See Nat. I'm set here. I won't f-."As of he had just jinxed himself, without any sort of warning, Peter watched as Clint dropped to the ground like a 230 pound sack of potatoes that had landed on its head, missing the carpet by about half a meter."Ow," he mumbled softly, remaining sprawled face down on the ground, showing no intention of moving.Peter struggled to retain his giggles as Steve barked out a loud laugh, informing the archer that he had deserved it."Yeah yeah. Shut up," he mumbled from the floor.•-•"Pete, could you go get Tony? I have a feeling that he's asleep in his lab again," Bruce asked the boy, his voice soft and tired sounding.Peter nodded quickly, giving the doctor a smile. He had clearly been working with Tony, but had enough common sense to go to bed while it was still dark. He obviously didnt get nearly enough sleep however, gauging from how he struggled to keep his eyes open."I'll be right back. Don't touch my food," Peter said quickly, glancing accusingly at Clint and Sam.Both men held their hands up in feign innocence, causing Peter to give them both another hard look.Natasha grinned as she smacked Clint upside the head, like she already knew his evil thoughts.Jumping out of his seat and racing down to Tony's lab, Peter squeezed himself out of the elevator without waiting for the doors to properly open.Another thing that he got in trouble for, but it was now too late for the impatient boy to change."Tony," Peter called, knocking softly against the glass door as he entered.Getting no response, he moved toward the larger than usual pile on the couch at the back.That couch had been put there from when Peter would come up to the to
