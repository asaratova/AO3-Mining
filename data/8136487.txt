Chapter 1: Kinda, Sorta.
    




Chapter Text
Tony was crying and he didn't even know why. Daddy said it was cause he needed a nap but he most certainly didn't! He wasn't even supposed to be little but somehow it snuck up on him. Daddy said that was cause he worked too hard and needed to get away from the stress sometimes. Tony thinks his Daddy is being super silly when he says things like that. Back to why he was crying though. If he were honest with himself it was because he missed his big brother Bucky, but Tony Stark was known for being the king of denial so he refused to even acknowledge that he kinda, sorta, missed him, a lot. "I know baby. It's so hard sometimes isn't it?" Steve crooned to the upset little. He knew that Tony having an accident when he was big was something that would hurdle him straight into his little space but this crying was not got to do with that. This was Tony missing his big brother and using this as a handy reason to cry. Steve passed by the communal area where Clint was playing with some action figures while Phil went over his paperwork, wanting to get Tony cleaned up and comfortable before the baby became even more upset than he was right now. It was Steve's fault he had the accident really. He should have thought to bring the diaper bag with him down to Tony, instead of hoping that he would stay big until he got upstairs. He hadn't expected him to have an accident while he was still big but it was the way of it he supposed. "Uncle Steve? Is Tony okay?" Clint called worriedly from where he was now watching the two pass."He will be bud, he's just a little tired. We'll be back out in a few minutes." Steve sent Clint a reassuring smile before looking over his head to Phil. Phil, understanding the silent enquiry, nodded and got up to get a bottle ready for Tony, Clint following behind, wanting to help out with the baby.Steve made his way to the nursery on the communal floor and into the bathroom connected to it, Jarvis turning the lights on as he went for them. "Now, here we go, let's just get you all nice and dry. Just a quick bath to get all the ick away and then we'll get you a bottle."Tony looked up blearily at his Daddy at the mention of a bottle. "Tony's Baba?" Steve smiled as he sat Tony down on the toilet seat to strip him while the bath filled (Having an AI in the tower was a big advantage sometimes.) "Yeah baby, you're baba. Uncle Phil is making it right now for you so how about we get you cleaned up super quick and then we can got out to Uncle Phil and Clint." Steve made sure to avoid Bucky's name, knowing it would just bring the tears back in full flow. Tony sniffled sadly as his Daddy lowered him into the bath but nodded nonetheless. He wanted to see Clint and Uncle Phil, even if they weren't Bucky he still liked them lots. Uncle Phil told the best stories and Clint was really funny! Daddy wasn't kidding around when he said it would be a quick bath. Tony felt like he had only relaxed into it and he was being swaddled into a bath towel to be dried off and carried into the nursery. Daddy laid him on Bucky's bed instead of the changing table though, which was odd, because it was always the changing table. He looked up quizzically at his Daddy. It made a lot more sense when his Daddy took out the powder and started to rub it all over him. Tony was very nearly asleep when his Daddy stopped, making Tony let out a whine in displeasure. The whine was quickly cut off though with a rubber nipple being pushed between it lips. Tony latched onto the pacifier immediately, delighted to be reunited with him beloved paci. Now if he could have his green bear (aptly named the hulk, something that still makes Bruce smile widely when he hears it), everything would be aces. As if his Daddy was reading his mind, his teddy was settled against his head so that the soft fur brushed his cheek as he suckled on his paci. After that it was a bit of a blur to Tony. He kind of remembered Daddy strapping a diaper around his hips and taking the towel away but not really. He doesn't even realise they were moving until they were in the living room again until Clint was shouting out a hello to him. The loud noise made him flinch and whine and made Daddy and Uncle Phil shush Clint. He whined once more when Daddy sat them back and settled Tony so that he could exchange the pacifier for the bottle. His face screwed up with the threat of tears before the paci was replaced for the bottle. He instantly began to suckle, the warm milk doing its job in soothing him. He was asleep before the bottle was even half finished. ***Bucky took out the last of the hydra camp with grim satisfaction. Mission accomplished. It took the best part of two weeks for this to happen but he was now finally able to go home. He needed to go home. He hadn't been little in over two weeks at this point with the way things happened and it was started to wear on him. There was a reason it was written in the law that little's had to go in
