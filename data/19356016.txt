 Bucky gets a cat.Not on purpose.Then again, nothing that’s ever happened to him since the day he’d been drafted to war over a century ago has ever been a result of his own volitation.Though, unlike everything else in his life, getting a cat is a welcome distraction: Steve’s been sulking near-constantly since their return to the United States, and neither Romanoff or Barton do anything more than exuberate his mood. Though thankfully, with the Witch transferred under the watch of a Stephen Strange, nothing more comes of it.Nonetheless, Bucky stays clear as often as he can and whenever he can, particularly when Steve gets into one of his nostalgically angsty moods.Sam’s been of the opinion that they’d gotten the best deal they could’ve after the Civil War fiasco and has taken their probationary house-arrest with all the grace no one else has.Scott’s just happy to be here.But back to the topic: the cat.Bucky had discovered the thing in one of his haunts – a shadowed corner of Tony’s ‘shop – where it claimed sovereignty over some scrapped parts that Tony himself hadn’t known what to do with.Tony’s made it a point not to be around too often since the Rogues moved back in, and while it’s a shame that Bucky had to avail himself to the muffled noises of Tony’s tinkering from deeper in the ‘shop, it’s not like Bucky doesn’t get it.Which is to say that Steve doesn’t, and that’s at least eighty percent of the reason why he’s been in such a mood since Tony had cold-shouldered him and relegated all of them to the metaphorical dog-house in a mostly-undeveloped part of the Compound as far away from Tony and his family as possible. Barton had claimed it cursed when, not for the first time, the ice-machine was suddenly using him for target practice.Two years isn’t nearly enough to get over a betrayal from the monument of righteousness that is Captain America nor the total abandonment of more than half of his team.Bucky comforts himself that Tony, no doubt, knows of Bucky’s occasional visits and hasn’t done anything to deter him.Until now.The cat scratches anything that gets too close, hisses at shadows and is generally a surly little bastard. She (as Bucky will find out later when he manages to wrangle her in and take her to the vet) also has a white forepaw as opposed to the other black ones, so, whether Tony meant the little thing to scare him away or not, it only succeeds in giving Bucky a friend instead.That she happens to dislike everyone on principle only adds to the positives of formally adopting her.Never mind that she’s clawed his arms up multiple times since. He figures if he can’t get cut up petting his cat then what is even the point of the Super Serum? Besides, as the Winter Soldier, he practically qualifies as an apex predator, she’s just making sure he knows what she’s capable of to keep him on his toes.That she wasn’t much pleased with Sam when he’d tried to pet her – to Bucky’s own anticipation of her reaction – only makes him grin which in turn makes Scott slightly uncomfortable because apparently Bucky has a natural serial killer aura and smiling only makes it worse.Bucky’s pretty sure he loves the little darling.Tony, it turns out, hadn’t gotten the cat to keep Bucky away (which had clearly failed spectacularly given the way Bucky’s taken to carrying her whenever she refuses to take her naps anywhere that isn’t on him).In fact, Tony doesn’t find out about the cat until a month later:With the kids and the Colonel out of state, and Bruce hiding out in the labs with Doctor Cho over a toy they’ve refused to let Tony play with unsupervised – the man had made every excuse to be away. Not that Bucky was counting down the days until he showed his face again. It’s not like Bucky wanted to introduce his cat to the engineer or anything.While they’re far from antagonistic towards one another, and practically chummy compared to Tony and the Rogues, they aren’t exactly friends.Bucky would like them to be from the interactions he’s been a witness to since his defrost from Princess Shuri’s freezer, but he’d never presume anything. Tony has every reason in the world to hate him after all, even if Tony’s also taken to leaving food in the lab that’s way more than he eats and definitely enough for two people, and has moved his couch nearer to Bucky’s preferred hiding spot. But it probably doesn’t mean anything. Right?Anyway, when he hears that Tony’s back from the grapevine aka Friday, Bucky’s surprising ally in his new home, Bucky’s suddenly distracted by the fact that his damn cat is missing.He wasn’t going to introduce them. He wasn’t.He just figured if there was a good reason to talk to Tony, the cat would be a good opening, Bucky’s prosthetic malfunctioning aside – which would be impossible since it was a joint collaboration with both Princess Shuri and Tony himself. Short of having it ripped off, Bucky has doubts he’d need maintenance at all until the yearly physical which is too damn far to wait on.In any c
