Peter was sad, sure, but Loki would be back. For now, he had a bigger problem on his hands.
 
The Avengers still wanted to know who was his favorite.
 
Peter thought they would move on, but no, they were still asking. Peter had half the mind to just tell them so they would stop annoying him.
 
But he wouldn't give in.
 
Not yet.
 
Thanksgiving break was coming up soon, Peter almost forgot about that. May would be coming down, which made him excited. He hadn't seen his Aunt in person for a while, so this would be good for him.
 
Peter still had school for the time being, and a substitute in history. And he didn't like the substitute, he didn't take any shit. He wouldn't believe that Peter was adopted by Tony, and Peter hadn't told his dad yet. The substitute would be gone in a couple of days, anyway.
 
But Peter would just have to deal with him. Mr. Blans wasn't too bad.
 
That's what he thought, anyway. As Peter made his way to school for the last day before Thanksgiving break, he had a funny feeling.
 
Not his spidey-sense, it didn't feel like that. So he brushed it off as nothing.
 
He met up with Ned and MJ outside the school and they all went into class together.
 
History class.
 
With Mr. Blans.
 
Peter checked the time on his phone as he sat down at his chair, but he got distracted when he saw a weird notification.
 
He had been put in a group chat, with the Avengers.
 
Peter still had a few minutes before class started, so he decided to check it out.

Peter smiled, deciding to answer. He could pay attention to class later.
He was just typing out his answer when he heard someone clear their throat. To Peter's dismay, he looked up and made eye contact with Mr. Blans.
"Peter, what do you think you're doing?" Mr. Blans asks, taking Peter's phone out of the poor boy's hands.
"Wait- No, I can, I can explain." Peter says, trying to grab it back.
"You will explain in the principals office, how about that?" Mr. Blans asks flatly, looking at Peter's phone. Luckily, he was too old to figure out that Spider-Kid was Peter.
"What are these names? Tony Stank, RedWhiteBlue
