One.

The Stark helicopter must have just landed, its blades still blurring with movement and creating a gust of wind that swept up Pepper Potts' hair as she leaned over the gurney, one hand on the sidebar and the other on the Iron Man face plate. The seemingly invincible Iron Man, always in motion and soaring through the skies of New York, lied eerily still. The structure of the stretcher and the angle obscured the torso of the suit, though marks of damage were visible – particularly the harsh horizontal line across the chest. Vision floated above the frenzied swarm of medical personnel, amber eyes cast downward. Near the doors leading into Columbia Medical, James Rhodes sat in his wheelchair, fear and fury warring in his narrowed eyes, thinned lips, and tensed shoulders.
*Tony returned from Siberia with three broken ribs, five bruised ones, and one shattered artificial sternum. He also had a severe concussion, bronchitis, and the beginnings of cardiac failure. The doctors said it was sheer luck, an absolute miracle, that Tony did not suffer any internal bleeding. Pepper shook her head, ruefully noting that Tony's never really been lucky while Jim clasped his hand and said a prayer for his friend.The surgeries took place over three days. FRIDAY had provided necessary documents and instructions for reconstructing the sternum, nothing more and nothing less. She would protect Boss in her own way. Vision stood guard outside Tony's private room and watched everything with cautious and regretful eyes.*Government officials, domestic and international, fought over who would be first in line to question Tony when he woke from the medically induced coma – Jim found comfort in their certainty that Tony would wake. General Ross, however, was not one of them; anonymous files containing his illegal and inhumane activities were delivered to the United Nations as well as each of the 117 countries that supported the Accords.While he was not a showman, Jim had learned a thing or two from Tony over the years and managed to soothe most of the ruffled feathers by either calling in favors owed or appealing to egos. None of Ross' allies spoke up in his defense, resulting in the former General receiving the maximum sentence for his many crimes."Tony would have been proud." Jim thought as he exited the latest joint panel meeting."Colonel. A moment." General Summers said, posture unyielding as he joined Jim's wait for the elevator. It was clearly a command and not a question, given the fact that General Summers had a long and decorated military career and was used to giving orders. "The Army will be making a formal announcement to strip Mr. Rogers of his title in the next few days. I imagine the Air Force will do so similarly with Mr. Wilson's status.""Yes." General Rosenberg joined them, back straight and shoulders stiff. "We don't take kindly to deserters.""Nor those who would leave a fellow soldier behind." General Summers added sternly, then his tone shifted to something kinder. "How goes your recovery, Colonel?"Jim looked up, he was always looking up these days. "As well as to be expected, sir."The downward arrow lit up and the doors slid open. General Rosenberg walked in first, extending a hand to keep the doors open. "I've seen Mr. Stark accomplish some extraordinary things, I've no doubt he'll continue to do so. The Iron Patriot will fly again.""Thank you, sir." With steady movements, Jim maneuvered the wheelchair into the elevator, pivoting to face away from two of the most powerful men in the United States armed forces. He couldn't care less about War Machine, he would be happy looking up at the sky for the rest of his life as long as it meant Iron Man would be soaring above.*Pepper held the Stark Industries board at bay, both with her particular brand of polite threats and new schematics FRIDAY provided for the next generation of Stark Phones. She hosted several press conferences, addressing inquiries about Tony Stark with her usual precision and professionalism. The quiver in her request for prayers for Tony, who remained in intensive care, garnered astonishing airtime.The most popular clip, however, was the interview she granted Christine Everhart. It started out cordial enough, given the history they shared, but soon derailed into animosity as soon as the Avengers were brought up."Miss Potts, how do you respond to allegations that Mr. Stark drove the Avengers apart through his unwillingness to listen to other points of view?" Christine said, voice saccharine and eyes vicious."Is it unwillingness to listen if Mr. Rogers never said anything of substance?" Pepper parried. "My understanding is that Tony reached out multiple times to open a line of communication and Mr. Rogers shut down each attempt with increasing hostility. Tony has repeatedly pled their case and sought pardons and leniency for these fugitives–""Fugitives? That's rather harsh, don't you think?" Christine interrupted. "It makes me question your
