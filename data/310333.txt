Darcy knew at an intellectual level that it was coming but it didn’t make it any easier.“No, that’s great,” she says anyway because she’d been prepared, had rehearsed her reaction so as not to show her own disappointment. It comes out a tiny bit stilted but she’s pretty sure not enough for Jane to notice.Jane notices. Of course she does.“It’s your... I’m happy for you,” Darcy insists and Jane just stares at her steadily, waiting her out in that patented patient Jane way. She should not be brilliant and also have overlarge manga eyes to break people’s will with.It’s just unfair.“You’re obviously not,” Jane says, always straight to the point.She’s not unhappy is the thing. Of course she’s happy for Jane, that Jane is moving in with her fantastic demigod boyfriend and they’re going to live in a mansion amongst superheroes.She’s just not happy on her own behalf because while again, intellectually she knew it wouldn’t last, she’d still grown to like living in the small, SHIELD provided apartment with Jane. The fantastic demigod and sometimes his demigod friends would drop by and there was always the chance of something exciting happening. While the apartment’s nice and all, it’s just not the same without Jane in it.Darcy on her own, again.“You’re coming too,” Jane says, surprising Darcy out of her maudlin thoughts.“I... what?” Darcy says, blinks at Jane.“It’s a mansion. Apparently there’s a whole wing that isn’t being used by anyone. I told Thor I’d only move if you could come with us and SHIELD were really pleased to get one of their safe houses back.”“You... I’m coming too?” Darcy repeats, because it bears repeating.“You sound surprised,” Jane says, looking puzzled.“I just... never expected to be moving into a mansion without having to sleep with some old guy,” Darcy says and then it catches up to her, what’s happening. She’s moving into a mansion with Jane’s fantastic demigod boyfriend and a bunch of superheroes.“They’re coming over to help us move on Thursday so we’d better start packing,” Jane orders and Darcy groans, because the euphoria of moving is short-lived with the prospect of packing in their future.*“Do you really need this?” Captain America is asking her, hefting her ancient television set. “Tony’s got a widescreen in every room, sometimes two.” Darcy just stares at him because Captain America is carrying her television. The thing is about a million years old, from the dawn of television time and Darcy knows for a fact that it weighs more than it looks like it does tucked under Captain America’s arm.He’d introduced himself as Steve but Darcy just can’t get there mentally yet, she’s having enough trouble with the idea that she’s going to be living in the same house as the guy, seeing him in a t-shirt and jeans and wearing sunglasses like an every day person which he is not.“It’s got sentimental value,” she blurts because it does. It was her dad’s television and she has real trouble letting go of things that still work like he always did, even if they were surpassed by something newer and shinier. She has an ipod because she’s actually living in this century but it was bought only under protest when her walkman gave up the ghost and could not be salvaged.Captain America... Steve smiles at her gently like he totally understands and heads for the truck that was sent over for their stuff, Thor behind the wheel looking altogether too gleeful about it. He’s just got his license and he keeps saying how he missed controlling a mighty steed or something like that, thinks the truck with its size is a sufficient substitute.Jane drops down beside her. She’d been trying to help but had given up when Thor had taken a box out of her arms for the fifth time. “I feel like I should object being a modern woman and all but it is fun watching these guys work,” she leans into Darcy to confide. Darcy nods as they watch Thor carry a refrigerator out like it weighs as much as a feather pillow. “Honey, I think that came with the apartment,” she calls, darts up and over to Thor to steer him back towards the apartment.She’s back in a few moments, grinning and blushing because Thor had paused long enough to juggle to refrigerator sideways so that he could kiss her soundly. “It must be nice,” Darcy muses. “He’s not likely to ever disappoint you.”“No, he really isn’t,” Jane agrees.*Darcy meets Natasha when they first arrive back at the mansion. She was described by Thor as deadly and beautiful and Darcy can see why. Natasha just looks at her for a moment before offering a hand to shake. Darcy takes it, expecting to get her hand crushed or something equally combative but the shake is just warm and firm.“Thank god,” Natasha says simply. “Other women.”Darcy grins at her, likes her immediately, more so when she discovers Natasha has a secret shared passion for bad karaoke and good sushi.Tony Stark proves more elusive, it takes a full week before Darcy even so much as glimpses him, another before he finally gets around to s
