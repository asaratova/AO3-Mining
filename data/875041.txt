Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
It could very easily be said that the events that lead to the meeting of two unlikely souls, were set in motion by fair Lady Jane herself. That it was her delicate hand, her dainty finger that upset the balance that kept two kingdoms on a thread of peace where both parties danced around each other, touching that thread but never truly breaking it. Asgard was powerful, stronger than all realms combined and Jotunhiem was wild, feral to the point of being barbaric and though they would be rather easy to defeat without their casket, neither realm wanted to test that fact. Asgard was careful, Jotunhiem was wary.And it rested solely on the mutual respect both kings had for each other.Where Odin was an all knowing, powerful man, wiser than all, Laufey was clever and knew nothing good would come from fighting the Golden Realm herself. They met often, talked often and it was understood that they had a standing, though tense, friendship.It was also known that while Frigga, All mother and Queen to Odin accepted this friendship and met Laufey with the respect he deserved every time they met, Laufey’s mate and consort offered no such hand of camaraderie.For Farbauti was of the old thinking, coming from a Jotun land that still harbored a deep hatred of the Aesir and would do anything to annihilate them. He was tough, cruel, sadistic and feared in his realm and most others because of his ruthless attitude. He moved without mercy and killed with a sadist hand that left none alive.All the nine realms knew him, all the nine realms feared him.For they knew the only thing that was stopping him from destroying everything around was Laufey.Farbauti may insult all realms and declare himself above the rules and destroy what he needed to without cause if he had something to gain, but since he came from his tribe, the one still bound to the old ways, he obeyed his king. He roared about it, he threatened and often hit Laufey, but he obeyed him when the order was given and no matter what went through him, what internal rage feasted on him and stoked his rage, he would move off, back off and stay where Laufey told him to.Because in the end, he was still a consort, brought to the royal city because of his strength and unwavering loyalty to Jotunhiem.But that was all about to change, because a mortal, one fair Lady Jane had already set in motion the ripples that would invoke a second war between the realms and change the destiny of every living being that resided above.Especially the fate of two who never saw it coming…***Golden prince Thor was born in a palace of gold and amber, with a gold spoon in his mouth and the power of an entire realm behind him.It was said it thundered and shone the skies, the might of this young babe, so small in the hands of his mother, Queen Frigga who had fallen into a slumber an hour after the birth, far too exhausted to keep track of who now held the bilgesnipe she had pushed into the world.  For Thor wasn’t an easy birth.And Odin, one who remained by his wife while she transformed from a gentle, soft woman to a screaming, cursing hellion, vowed to eternal celibacy if it meant never seeing this side of his wife again.But he remained with her, stroking her hair as their child was born, as the thunder roared above and lightning clashed, falling to the ground with every painful contraction poor Frigga had to endure. He chanted to her soothing words every time she cursed him and he made her promises when she threatened him.Gifts so lavish it shamed the elves were already piled in his room, ready for his wife’s acceptance. For Odin knew from experience that once the child was born, once her cursing was faded and once she went back to being a calm woman, Frigga would love everything he did for her.And gifts were only the beginning.Odin had yet to hold his new babe. He had seen him, of course and named him, but didn’t hold him. It was the simple fact that his wife needed him more at the moment that kept him away from Thor, who was now cuddled and bundled in the softest silks, lying in a crib in the healer’s room while his brother, four year old Balder, watched from his tip toes.Balder was the said experience that taught Odin most of the tricks to please his wife and as Odin looked upon the brown haired, blue eyed First prince, he smiled.Balder, wise even in this young age, was afraid of touching his new baby brother, though it was plain he wanted to. He would raise a hand and try to touch the golden locks his brother had taken from their mother but stopped every time.Their nursemaid, one beautiful Idunn, brought here a millennia ago and a Queen in her land before her ousting, had insisted she become Balder’s nurse the moment Odin had called her to see the child. She fell in love with him and her eternal youth had the boy captured immediately.And what a pair they made, running about like brother and sister more often than mot and planting seeds of trees Idunn was fond of gr
