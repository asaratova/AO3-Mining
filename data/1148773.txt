Chapter 1: It's What You Do
    




Chapter Text
Tony woke up slowly, at peace.Why was that?Why was he so warm?Did he have to get up? He didn’t want to.For the first time since Phil had died…Oh, right, Phil had died.His eyes flickered open to meet calm blue eyes….And promptly panicked. Because he remembered waking up, he was awake, he had to be and Phil was still here.“I’m alive.” 
I’m alive.
He felt tears slip down his cheeks as he buried his face in a warm shoulder, pressing his face into the safety of Phil. “I missed you,” he said, in that small, broken voice that he knew Phil hated but couldn’t keep himself from using.“I love you, too.”And after three and a bit months, fourteen weeks (ninety-seven days, four hours, seventeen minutes) Tony stopped counting, and just cried. Phil let him, even though he had to be ruining that perfectly tailored suit.
