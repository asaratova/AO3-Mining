peter-man @peterparkour

@IronSandwich mr stark i'm a gen z spider child, i am a gen z child and depression is part of the package that comes with existence when you are in my generation.

Iron Dad* @IronSandwich

Karen @spideysAI

@IronSandwich He is eating a churro and his vitals are normal, I think it is safe to say he is okay.
 

Iron Dad* @IronSandwich

@spideysAI Just okay???
 

Karen @spideysAI

@IronSandwich He is alive and his mood seems to be ‘pleased’ as he is eating a churro, he told me it tastes good.
 

Iron Dad* @IronSandwich

everyone thinks my ‘alcoholic tendencies’ (despite being sober for 3 years) will be the death of me, but it will actually be the kid.
