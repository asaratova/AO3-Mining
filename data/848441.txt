'This doesn't have to be anything at all'- stop draggin' my heart around by Stevie Nicks........"What's wrong? Why are you in my lab, Lewis? You shouldn't be in my lab," Tony says, taking a step towards Darcy where she is curled up, hugging her knees under one of his workbenches. "I think it's pretty obvious I'm hiding," Darcy says."But this is my lab. You need to not be in my space. Go pester Bruce. I have things to do here," Tony says, waving his arms about for emphasis."I'm pregnant," Darcy says, breath hitching."Why are you telling me this?""I don't know. Jane's in New Mexico, and I don't have anyone else, and you asked," Darcy says, wiping tears away as they form. "Why aren't you talking to the golden boy or the one-armed wonder? Aren't you besties?" Tony asks as he fiddles with something in his hands, and Darcy shakes her head no. "No? What it's not Barnes' sprog is it? I thought you knew better that to touch that hot mess, and the Widow called dibs." "No, it's not Bucky's," she says pulling the sleeves of her oversized green sweater over her hands. "Well, it's not like it's Steve-o's, he’d have to take his purity ring off first," Tony says, stepping around Dummy, reaching for a screwdriver, and sitting on the floor beside Darcy. "Hello, Earth to Lewis? Are you even listening to me? That was funny. Captain Freezer-burn, knocking you up. Isn't he with Agent Blondie?" "Agent Carter," Darcy says as she worries at a loose thread on her sweater. "The boys have been on assignment together with her for the past month.""So who's the baby daddy anyway?"  Tony asks. Darcy winces and looks away. "Lewis?""Steve," Darcy says, her voice barely a whisper. Tony stops working on the bits of metal and wire in his hand and looks at her. "That's not funny, Lewis.""No, it's not.""How?""Well, you see the penis goes in the vagina....""But you're not dating. You haven't been on a date since that Agent Walleye spilled his wine all over your yellow dress. Why do I not know about this?""Because it's a secret." "But I should know this," Tony says."Nobody knows but JARVIS," Darcy mutters and Tony narrows his eyes at her."What do you mean JARVIS knows? And not me?" Tony says affronted. "JARVIS?""Miss Lewis and Captain Rogers requested I not tell you of their dating, sir," JARVIS says."We never dated," she mutters under her breath."Excuse me, Miss Lewis. Sargent Barnes and Captain Rogers are inquiring after your whereabouts.""Oh god, I'm so fucked." "That's what she said. JARVIS, tell them Darcy isn’t in the tower today," Tony says.“Very good, sir,” the AI replies, and Darcy lets out a breath she didn’t realize she had been holding."Thank you," Darcy says, throwing her arms around Tony.  He awkwardly pats Darcy's back, and she blinks back more tears. Dummy offers her a box of tissues that she accepts with another watery thank you. "So how long have you been making the Star Spangled Beast with Two Backs?""Since that battle with Doom and that mechanical squid thing that tried to tentacle rape you, broke Barton's leg, and gave Natasha a concussion.""It did not try to do anything to Iron Man," Tony sniffs. "Wait a minute, that was months ago. You've been bumping uglies with Red, White and Blue Balls for four months?""It just sorta happened...and kept happening. And he's with Sharon now and I can't fuck that up for him. I can't ruin his life because I missed a pill when you took the nerd herd out for Shwarma and I got food poisoning and spent two days with my head over the porcelain throne.""Again, why are you telling me this?" Tony asks, splaying his hand over his chest above the arc reactor."Such an asshole. I don't know what Pepper sees in you," Darcy laughs and straightens up on her own. "I'm very flexible and have a huge cock," Tony says, reaching up to play with another scrap of metal. "You okay, kid?""No, not really," Darcy says, hugging herself, "I'm gonna go see if I can book a flight out to Grandma Lucy in Spokane.""Book?" Tony scoffs."It's what us plebeians do," Darcy says as she stands up, dusting off her jeans."Billionaire," Tony says, and Darcy looks at him blankly. "I own a plane, several in fact. Stop looking at me like that. JARVIS, can you have the jet ready for Darcy within the hour?""Yes sir.""I can't—""Don't finish that sentence. Go pack, go visit grandma Lewis, and call JARVIS to send the jet to pick you back up in a few days.""You won't say anything to Steve or anyone?" she asks. It's cowardly, but she just wants to get away and not have to destroy the bubble of happiness Steve has found, even if it breaks her heart."Cross my heart," Tony says making a cross over his arc reactor. Darcy looks dubious for a moment, but really, what choice does she have? She finally nods and takes a steadying breath. "Thank you," she says, and Tony shakes his head dismissively.Darcy is nearly out of the lab when Tony says, "You love him.""Yeah, but he doesn't love me," she says softly and slips out the door.........Months g
