Chapter 1: In Which Fate Kicks Names and Takes Ass
    




Chapter Text
A trainee stood before Fate. He quivered in his spot until she noticed him. Then he really began to quake in fear.
“What is it?” she snapped. “I put up the Do Not Disturb sign for a reason.”
“Y-you might want t-to see what’s ha-happening on Earth,” he said.
“I have no time for that,” she said. “Unbonded souls have been pinging back here and I don’t know why. Some of them aren’t even my souls.”
“Um…”
She sighed.
“I suppose it can wait until later,” she said. “But if these other souls are destined for…” She checked the readings she had taken. “Valhalla, then why did they come to me? That’s not my department.”
“P-please?”
Reluctantly, Fate left her workshop and followed the trainee to the communications hall. She realised immediately why she’d been summoned.
It was chaos. On a scale she hadn’t seen since… since the dawn of time itself. Even then, the chaos was that of creation. Assigning tasks to people. Discovering what jobs needed to be founded and how to carry them out.
This was the chaos of destruction. And a tug on her body soon told her why.
She sank to the ground. The Soul Stone.
“What has happened?” she demanded.
“Half of Knowhere’s population has… has died!” a technician exclaimed.
Fate’s eyes flashed as she dug her nails into her palms. She and her other soul creators had all been born from the Soul Stone. It called to her, as it called to them.
“Where is the being who possesses the Soul Stone?” she said.
Frantically, people began to search screens, radars, and other machines. More soul creators gravitated out of their workshops. The Xandarian soul creator was too busy, and the Asgardian soul creator had been busy for a few days. Both of them were most likely handling the influx of returned souls, from lives which had been ended too early. Fate didn’t envy them. She’d hate to…
A shockwave shot through her. She was already on the ground, but the rest of the soul creators fell to the floor. Everyone did.
“No… one stone… could have that power,” Fate said, struggling to her feet. She returned to her room and saw her shelves filling with returned souls. Most of them had appeared as one, but more of them appeared slowly.
She ran back out of the room, grabbing her cloak on the way.
“D-do you need he-help?” the trainee asked, trailing her to the double doors.
“No,” Fate said. She pointed to one of the screens. “He used the Infinity Stones on Earth. The last planet he decimated is my planet. I’m going to stop him. Just keep my room from overflowing with souls.”
She swept out the doors, cape flowing behind her, and summoned her sleigh with a snap of her fingers. She boarded it and, with a single thought, set out.
According to the reports she was receiving from headquarters, the being controlling the Infinity Stones was a Titan named Thanos. He had now left Earth for his home planet. Technically someone else’s domain, but that particular soul creator had retired long ago, after nearly everyone died. Apparently one lonely soul remained, without its other half.
Fate landed her sleigh on the top of a desert hill. She surveyed the land, searching for the remaining Titan.
“Where are you?” she murmured.
Eventually she found him. A large being, just as his soul creator had been. This one had light purple skin and vertical markings on his chin. He looked surprised to see anyone else around.
“How did you get here?” he asked.
“You are misusing the Infinity Stones,” Fate said. “The one who created your soul would be disappointed that his remaining creation has caused so much destruction. Not to mention an inordinate amount of paperwork for us.”
“How would you know who created my soul?” Thanos said.
“I am a soul creator,” she said, crossing her arms. “The gems will not work on me.”
“All of them, or just the Soul Stone?” he asked, glancing down at the gauntlet on his hand with an evil smile.
Fate’s eyes narrowed.
SMACK.
Thanos’s head whipped to the right. Fate’s hand tingled from the hard slap she had delivered to him. He stared at her incredulously, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Hand me that gauntlet,” she said, holding out her hand. “Now.”
“I do not answer to humans.”
“I am no human.”
Fate summoned her sleigh. It bowled over Thanos, sending him sprawling to the ground, and returned to settle over his arm. Fate stomped on his lower arm with the sharp heel of her left shoe, and used the cover of her sleigh to bend down, grab the gauntlet, and haul it off. Thanos growled angrily, but couldn’t move his arm until Fate was back in the sleigh, the gauntlet between her feet, and rode into the sky.
 
“So you can reverse the damage he has done since the gauntlet came into his possession?” Knowhere’s soul creator asked.
The Grandmaster, as he now called himself, looked over the gauntlet that Fate had retrieved from Thanos. He sighed.
“Sure, it’s an easy fix,” he said. “But what are you going to do about Thanos? I can reverse the deaths he’s caused, but a lot of
