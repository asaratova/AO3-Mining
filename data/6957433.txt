Perhaps the only universal constant that was irrevocably indisputable was the fact that life sucked. Steve had gone and broken the rest of the Avengers out of the Raft, leaving Tony holding the bag, yet again. The actual act of getting the Avengers out of the Raft wasn’t something that Tony had begrudged Steve, but he wished Steve would have let him do it himself. They could hate and rail at him afterwards, but now, with Clint and Scott escaped from Ross’s illegal detainment, the general would be out for blood.Steve and the rest of the former Avengers were, no doubt, living in “hiding.” Wakanda was still insular enough for that to hold water, and though T’Challa was still going through the song and dance of his inauguration from His Panthery Highness to His Pantherous Majesty, Tony figured he would have more than a little time before he had to deal with things falling apart again.Unfortunately, this also meant that Tony was going to have to be the one to clean up Cap’s messes, yet again. Tony, manfully, resisted the urge to hand the flip phone Steve had given him to Dummy and tell his beautiful little disaster of a helper bot to make a smoothie out of it. He would tell everyone about it. Later. When his heart and his brain had time to reconcile whatever it was they needed to reconcile.Tony rubbed a hand over his face, perfectly recalled shards of memory snapping through his mind. A lonely road in December. Falling up towards the stars, the majesty of the infinite spread out before him. More pain than his mind could process as his chest was opened and his heart exposed to the world. Jetting down towards the ground to chase after his soul encased in a suit of silver. Killing the man who ought have been his father. A vibranium shield glinting in snow light as it swung down to cleave his heart. Terrified, guilty, ice chip blue eyes sunken and covered by hobo hair. Cornered, guilty, patriotic blue eyes unimpeded by gold crew cuts. Teary green eyes framed by fiery hair as they left, taking his heart with them. A boy taking a hit and lying on the ground, motor mouth silent for a millisecond too long. A child with bright eyes and a wide smile, reaching out with too small hands. Carefully complied statistics and death counts. Mountains leveled. Children reduced to ash. Cities floating above the clouds. Nations reduced to rubble. The Earth, a mote of dust rendered barren by the wrath of beings from beyond the stars, suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth, a mote of blue and green, verdant, fragile, glistening in the light of her warm star.Tony stood and let the weight of his choices, his sins, his memories, and his dreams slip away.He had families to save.
 “Why are you here?” Laura Barton’s face was impressively impassive. Tony figured you picked up a few things when you were married to asshole super spies who couldn’t keep their priorities straight. She still had her ticks, though, and Tony had been trained from childhood to pick upon those types of things. Her eyes darted behind him, probably looking for tac squads or police vehicles. There wasn’t anything behind him, though. Nothing visible, at any rate.Tony took off his sunglasses, pushing them up so they rested on the top of his hair and behind his ears, so Laura could take a good look into his eyes. “May I come in?”Laura hesitated for a heartbeat before stepping back, motion for Tony to come inside.“Beautiful place you’ve got here. I see Barton did some more work before, you know, he decided to break international law.” Tony said as he sat down on the couch, Laura sitting down opposite him, eyes warry. Tony saw the way she put herself between him and the stairs to the upper portion of the house. He saw her eyes flick furtively to the stairs before refocusing on him. Tony even managed to hear the scramble of what was likely little tykes on the stairwell.“Why are you here?” Laura repeated, looking calmer, now. She ignored the jibe about her husband, though Tony noticed the way her mouth firmed up, tension working its way into her shoulders.Tony tilted his head, “I’m here to offer you a job.”Laura blinked, “What?”Tony nodded, “Ross doesn’t know you exist. Yet. Barton covered his tracks pretty well, but there’s no SHIELD to cover for you anymore. You need to leave. Just so happens I have a very visible, very lucrative, and mostly-kinda-sorta job opening for a PA available. Benefits include family health, family dental, protection from over enthusiastic military assholes, completely new and completely legit identities for the entire family, and a surprising amount of upwards mobility.” Tony leaned backwards, spreading his arms over the back of the couch, “My last PA got ended up as my CEO.”Laura’s eyes darted between Tony’s. Tony let her look, wondering what she would see. Apparently, whatever it was she did see was very different from what Tony expected she would find, because she nodded her head, “When do I start?”Tony took his sunglass off from atop his art
