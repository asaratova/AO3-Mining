Chapter 1: Coupling
    


Notes:
As previously stated in other disclaimers: the following story is a work of fiction.  At the time of this writing, I am a law school graduate preparing to take the bar examination.  My experiences include working as a legal intern in my jurisdiction, and the idea of writing this series came about because of the work I was doing every day in a law office not unlike the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.That said, any similarity in this story to real people, places, events, or cases is entirely accidental. Nothing in this story is based directly off my experience. At no time have I lifted real cases, scenarios, or people from my work life and deposited them into this fic, and I won’t be doing so. Ever.Along those lines, too, please keep in mind: this is fiction. Although some of the law featured in this story is based on the real law of my jurisdiction, I have done no additional research and do not intend to. Legal concepts may be oversimplified, under-nuanced, or simply wrong for the purpose of the narrative.  I also am not familiar with the inner workings of an office like the one portrayed in this story (a legal aid office), and some details may be incorrect or omitted.This story involves characters which first appeared either in Motion Practice or Wade Wilson Explains it All.  Reading these stories for context is not required but may be helpful.  The first chapter also contains spoilers for Permanency.Thank you as always to Jen and saranoh, who have been incredibly encouraging as I embark on this new journey with new characters.

Chapter Text
“I can’t believe Stark conned somebody into marrying him,” Carol says.She’s perched on the edge of the conference room table, case file in her lap and eyes squinting at the television screen.  She’d wandered down the hallway on her way to do whatever she does wherever she usually does it—after a year at legal aid, Wade’s still not sure that Carol really accomplishes anything besides yelling—then came right back to peer at the TV.Wade wipes his mouth on the back of his hand.  “Shotgun wedding,” he explains once he’s swallowed the salsa-tastic ambrosia of the gods known as his breakfast burrito.“Pretty sure shotgun weddings only happen when somebody’s pregnant,” she returns.Wade shrugs.  “Pretty sure their cute little black kid came from somewhere,” he retorts, and reaches for his burrito again.In his defense, he really hadn’t planned on watching Tony Stark on morning TV.  Who in their right (or slightly-right, or slightly-wrong, or wrong) mind’d drop into a chair, flick on the old boob tube, and think to themselves, “Hey, I wanna watch some billionaire lawyer guy talk about needy kids for ten minutes”?  But he’d needed to eat somewhere, and his desk was pretty much just asking for him to dump salsa on a case file or whatever, and it wasn’t like anybody else was watching TV at nine-thirty on a Monday morning.He’d flipped past Star Trek: Voyager reruns and’d almost settled on them when he’d caught Stark on the local morning show.  And when Clint’d responded to his red-alert text with yeah his kid’s got us watching it—Look, the point is, he had a pretty good reason for all this.  Okay?  Okay.“I can’t believe he’s gesturing so much with his left hand,” Bobby offers, because it’s Bobby.  He’s always around, hovering and poking his head into people’s offices like he’s either bored or really concerned about their well-being.  Wade wishes it was the first one—hey, Bobby works with old people, it could easily be the first one—but he knows deep down it’s the second.  Bobby is literally the nicest person he’s ever met.  Like, if he were Catholic (he’s not; Wade’s asked), he’d be sainted or whatever.He’s sitting next to Wade, watching the program eagerly, which means Wade gets to witness the way he scowls when Carol starts laughing.  It’s a big belly laugh, and a chunk of scrambled egg falls out of Wade’s burrito and onto the foil.  “You’re kidding, right?” she demands, twisting around to look at Bobby.She braces herself on one hand, and the way she’s leaning back, it’s at least a little Moulin Rouge.  Wade wishes he found her hotter, ‘cause the twist-and-stare move’s pretty good.  “About what?” Bobby asks.“About mocking Stark for showing off his new bling.”Bobby frowns.  He looks old when he does it, all crinkly and craggy.  It’s a shame, too, ‘cause he’s kind of hot when he’s not scowling like an old guy chasing kids off his lawn.  “What are you talking about?” he asks.On the TV screen, Tony Stark runs his fingers through his hair.  The fingers of his left hand, to be exact, and exactness is important in law and ring-flashing contests.  Wade’s phone chimes while Carol and Bobby glare right through their bitch-off, and he almost chokes on a mouthful of egg and sausage when he reads the thing:Clint: he should just get bruces name tattooed on his forehead at this poi
