Chapter Text
Here is a list of prompts that I found on Tumblr. All credit for them goes to the Creator of them.Feel free to combine or reuse them for different pairings. If you don't see any prompt to like, don't be shy to request anything.

Imagine your OTP exchanging gifts for the first time during the holidays, maybe both a little nervous that the other won’t like their gift. It turns out that neither has any reason to be anxious; both love the other’s gift and kisses are exchanged along with each present.


Imagine person A of your OTP relentlessly flirting with B in public, just to see B blush.


Imagine your OTP studying together, and for every question answered right, somebody has to take off a piece of clothing.


Imagine Person A keeps having nightmares about Person B. They don’t know what disturbs them more— how scary the dreams are, or how arousing they are.


Person A has given up on love. Nope. Love is not for them. Forget that…. And then they meet person B and think; “Annnd this is the asshole who will ruin everything.”


Imagine your OTP is wrestling over the remote.


Imagine Person A of your OTP seeing Person B with bed hair for the first time, and being totally blown away by how cute/hot/etc. they look with their hair being a huge mess. Bonus: if Person A gets flustered when Person B pokes fun at them for liking it.


Imagine your OTP intertwining their fingers together while they’re in bed.


Imagine your OTP have a morning class together and person A always walks in late and has obviously just woken up and person B thinks that the grumpy person who sits in front of him is the cutest thing ever.


Person A leaving thigh hickeys on person B.


Imagine your OTP stuck in an elevator after they’ve had a fight. 

Imagine your OTP getting in a fight and one of them yelling that they love the other one and then it gets really quiet.

Imagine person A of your OTP scaring person B (during Halloween) on accident so badly that they cry.


Imagine your OTP cuddling under a blanket on a cold winter night. Person A gently wrapping their arms around Person B and lightly kissing down their neck making Person B shiver from something other than the cold outside.


Imagine your OTP running into each other under the mistletoe. Person A blushes and goes to suggest that they don’t have to kiss but Person B cuts them off with a kiss.


Imagine person A of your OTP wearing person B’s clothes.


Imagine person A walking out of the bathroom after a shower, half-naked and wreathed in steam, and B immediately dropping whatever they were holding. Bonus if it’s an animal which gives them the stink eye before slinking away.


Imagine your OTP as teachers at the same school who are always flirting and have their students shipping them without realizing it.


Imagine person A of your OTP coming home from the gym all sweaty. Person B sees this and gets instantly turned on.


Imagine your OTP moving in together. They’re unpacking each other’s boxes when they find, ah, interesting things they didn’t know the other person owned.


Imagine your OTP finding fanfic of each other, either separately or together. Alternately, imagine Person A writing fanfic of them and Person B finding it/finding out about it, or they both write it and find each other’s.


Imagine your OTP waking up at the same time for a midnight snack and Person B scares Person A on accident.


Imagine your OTP living together. The air conditioner breaks during the hottest week of summer and your OTP has to figure out how to stay cool. Alternately, the heating breaks during the coldest week of winter and your OTP has to figure out how to stay warm.


Imagine your OTP not having enough blankets for both of them and sharing. It takes some doing, but they settle comfortably into each other’s arms and fall asleep listening to each other’s heartbeat, smelling their hair, feeling the rise and fall of their breath. The next morning, they’re still in the same position.


Imagine your OTP living in a dorm. Person A thinks that person B is kinda cute, but otherwise doesn’t feel much for them. Person A goes to borrow a textbook from person B and walks in on person B in their pajamas with their hair all messed up and person A thinks it’s the cutest thing ever.


Imagine person B of your otp uses person A as a pillow.


Imagine person A of your otp goes to a bookstore and spends hours just looking at books and person B sees them and falls in love with how passionate they are and how geeky they are.

Imagine Persons A and B of your OTP both go to a private school. Person A is really studious and innocent, like never been kissed type thing. In contrast, Person B got kicked out of
