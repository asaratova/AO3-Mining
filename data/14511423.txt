“Woooah what does this one do?” Peter inched closer to the weapon on the table, only stopping when Tony's hand pressed against his chest. “I don’t know. Don’t touch it.”Peter’s wide eyes found another one. A small, grenade looking device made from alien materials. “What about this one?”Tony sounded tired. “That one vaporises anyone and anything within ten feet of it. Stay back.”“What about that one?”Tony grabbed Peters' arms and pushed him back into his seat, away from the weapons. “What did I say! Sit down and watch what I am doing. You are here to observe and not touch. What are you here to do?”Peter sighed, trying not to roll his eyes as he sullenly repeated Tony's instruction. “Observe and not touch.”Tony let go, turning back to his work. “Good, now pay attention.”They’d been collecting all of the weapons Toomes and his team had made so that Tony could find out what they did and could decide on how to proceed. Only, Peter didn’t want to just stay back and watch, he wanted to help. He stood from his chair, craning his head to see over Tony's shoulder at what he was doing. And then something exploded. Tony jumped back when the gun went off, throwing beams of light to the wall and blowing a hole right through it. The lab shook and Peter stumbled, grabbing onto one of the tables to stabilize himself. “Woah, that was so cool!”Tony turned with a smile, only for it to disappear with a shout of panic. “Yeah, that- Peter don’t touch that!”Peter pulled his hand away and looked to where Tony was pointing, only seeing the gun a millisecond before it went off. Tony let out a cry of panic as smoke and light enveloped the lab. “Peter!”Tony's heart pounded as he watched the smoke clear but Peter was...gone. “Peter? Where are you? Oh, god don’t be dead.”Tony looked around, pushing tables out of his way and trying to remember how to breathe because God, the kid could be vaporized, or portalled to another dimension or-“Mr Stark?” Tony froze. That couldn’t possibly be Peter, the voice was much too small but the kid was the only one that called him that. Tony slowly looked up to where the voice had come from and there, clinging, upside-down on the ceiling, was a tiny little Peter. His wide brown eyes and droopy curls were the same, as well as the tiny blue sweater that Peter had been wearing just five minutes before. Everything came together in Tony's head, colliding and exploding like fireworks that made his stomach twist. “Oh, fuck.”Peters' eyes widened impossibly further as a tiny, chubby finger stuck out to point at Tony, a sweet, squeaky voice coming along with it. “Naughty word!”……………………Tony pressed his fingers to his temples, squeezing his eyes shut as he ground out his words between gritted teeth. “What do you mean you can’t fix this?”Bruce pointed to the child happily eating animal crackers with Thor, little legs kicking his tiny trainers under the table as he babbled on about what animals he had. “Physically he’s fine!”Tony curled his fingers into fists, furious. “He’s two!” Bruce nodded as Thor wiggled his lion cracker and moo’d, making Peter giggle.“Well, yes. Judging by his size and developmental milestones he is around two years old but he’s still Peter. From what I can tell, he has all the knowledge that Peter had as a teenager, he’s just in a smaller body. He still thinks, feels and behaves like a two-year-old but he knows who we are and everything that Peter did before.”Bruce turned to Peter, smiling. “Hey, Peter? What’s twenty-three times forty-eight?”Peter held up his cracker, beaming. “One thousand, one hundred and four. Look, I got a hippo!”Bruce gave him a thumbs up before turning back to Tony. “Good job, buddy! See, he’s okay. It’s quite amazing actually.”Tony had to admit he was impressed. “Okay, fine. He’s a genius and he’s about ten times as adorable as he was before but it’s not going to be so amazing when I have to tell May that her nephew is a baby again. And what about Spider-Man? He can’t go back to his old life like this.”Bruce nodded. “Yeah, okay. You’re right. We can take a look at the weapon that caused this and see about reversing it. But until then, we’ll need to take care of him.”Tony watched as Peter walked his little zoo of crackers across the table, Thor following his behind. “I don’t know how to take care of kids, Bruce. I can barely take care of myself.”Bruce gripped his shoulder in comfort. “We’ll all be here to help you. It takes a village and all that. Anyway, it can’t be too hard. Peter is the most polite person on the planet besides Steve and-”“THAT WAS MINE!” Bruce and Tony turned at the tiny shout to see Peter squealing at a very surprised Thor. Peter may have been small but he still had his powers and it was easy as cake for his chubby hands to grip the table and lift it into the air above his head. Tony held out his hands, stopping the kid before be broke the table over Thor’s head. “Stop! You put that table down, right now!”Peter glared at him, red face screwing
