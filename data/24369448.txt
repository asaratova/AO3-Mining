Notes:

Trigger Warnings listed in End Note.
 Thank you to the runners of the irondadbigbang, this experience has been brilliant!  PLEASE READ THISI decided to tag this story 'Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings' because I wasn't sure what categories this falls into, and I want you all to be safe. So full disclosure, there are implications of sexual assault involving Peter, but it is only ever referenced briefly and subtly, it is never defined. It's not directly mentioned and is only ever implied.  This piece was inspired by Room, a book by Emma Donoghue, and the movie of the same name. If you have read, or seen Room, you'll notice a few similarities in terms of storyline, but after the first few chapters, I steered away from that narrative and created a different one that suits the personalities of these characters. I've simply taken a small piece of that world from those stories and thrown are favourite superheroes into the deep end. As AUs go, this one is definitely out there, I know. Note, you can obviously read this without seeing or reading Room, it works without that context, as a standalone. So, please do not worry if you haven't, it definitely still makes sense. But, if you really want to know the context, feel free to watch the movie or read the book first.Side note, spoilers for Frozen II.

Chapter Text
Morgan wanted to know everything. She knew a lot, but there were millions of things that she did not understand. She had questions, more than she could count on her fingers. Some days, she was sure that her head would explode if any more came to mind. Peter told her that was impossible; that could only happen to cartoon characters.Even with all the questions sloshing around in her brain, she knew three things for sure:
The world was destroyed in a massive loud blast when I was a baby, but Petey and I are safe in Room. 
Petey is the best big brother ever! 
Superheroes used to be real. 
“Petey, Petey, Petey!” Morgan chanted; she kicked the duvet off her legs and playfully nudged her brother’s arm, many times, to wake him.The sun was beaming through the skylight, it was morning, so they didn’t need to be asleep anymore.Princess Anna said it best. The sky’s awake, so I’m awake, so we have to play!“Wake up, wake up, wake up!”Peter smacked his lips together and muttered sleepily, “Hm?” He didn’t even open his eyes, “…Yeah?”“Wake up, silly!” Morgan turned; she pressed the back of her head against his hip and stretched her arms out in the air, “I’m six today!”Peter shook his head as he fought for the duvet, “No way.”“Yes, way!” Morgan excitedly thumped her feet against the wall.“No, no…” Peter stretched to ruffle the back of her hair, “Your birthday was last year.”Morgan rolled back into a lying position, so she could look him in the eye, “It happens every year!”Peter narrowed his eyes, “Really?”“Yeah…”“Oh…” He bopped her nose, “And you’re sure it’s today?”“Yes, yes, yes!”“Wow.” Peter tied his arms around her waist and dragged her into a hug, “You’re so grown up!”Morgan laid her head on his shoulder, “As big as you?”“Ummm, almost…” Peter hummed; he sat up and guided her down onto the floor, “Ah….” He clapped his hands, “Do you want your present now or later?”Morgan loved her birthday. Usually, they only got treats on a Sunday. It was a Monday, but it was her special day, so that meant more surprises.Morgan jumped onto the bed, “Now!” She yelled, “Please!”Peter shook his head but laughed; he did that a lot. “Excuse me, birthday girl.” He sang.Morgan bounced over to the end of the bed.Peter buried his hand down the back and pulled out a package wrapped in old newspaper and tape. She hadn’t seen him wrap or hide it; he must have done it when she was sleeping, in the wardrobe, after Bad Beck left. It was a clever hiding spot. Morgan wouldn’t have looked there.She thought she knew about all the hiding spots in Room, but Peter always found new ones; he was super-duper clever, “Here you go.”Morgan took the package and hugged it close to her chest. Excitement shot through her, zoom zoom! She couldn’t stop smiling or jumping; it was like she had eaten too much sugar. This was already the best birthday ever, “What is it?”Peter shrugged, “You’re gonna have to open it.”“Okay!” Morgan tore the paper away fast, “Wow!” It was a book, and she loved books more than the television, “Harry Potter and the….”Peter guided his finger along with the words to make it easier for her to read, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.”Morgan grinned, wider than the C
