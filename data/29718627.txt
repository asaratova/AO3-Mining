Chapter 1: Chapter One: Fuck You, Beck. Fuck You, Buddy.
    


Summary:

There’s a long pause, and Peter watches as the guy who isn’t Beck brushes off some dust in a place. “This will be amazing!” The guy breathes, excitement painting his features. “It could perhaps be our biggest scientific breakthrough yet!”Beck just rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Just get us back.”“Back where?” Peter pipes up.

Chapter Text
Peter wants to vomit. He really, really, wants to vomit.“Ned! Ned, can you hear me?” He says into his comm, jumping over rooftop after rooftop. He swings up and down, landing on the ground in front of an old abandoned warehouse. There’s a long pause, Peter’s heart thumping frantically in his chest.“Yeah, dude. I can. This is so  cool , Peter-”“Not now,” Peter says, alarmed. “Ned, I think I just spotted Beck.”There’s a long pause.“ What ? Dude, are you joking?”“No, I’m not. Do you mind if I vomit?”“Nope, I don’t. Understandable.”Peter snorts. “What should we do?” Peter says, pacing the deck, glancing at the dark sky. Ned doesn’t answer. “Ned?”“I’m not sure,” Ned says. “What do you think?”Peter pulls the warehouse door off its hinges. “Uh, first and foremost, text May, and Happy about it. They need to know and be able to prepare themselves.” Peter continues investigating the warehouse. “This seems too convenient…” Peter mumbles.“What?”“Nevermind. Just, this warehouse. I think this might be Beck’s hideout. But it shouldn’t be this easy to find-?” There’s a loud crash, and Peter jumps onto the ceiling, holding his breath.The damaged warehouse is scattered with a bunch of books, BARF tech (which makes Peter shudder). “Peter?” Ned asks, his voice significantly quieter.“Shh…” Peter whispers, watching as Beck stumbles in, clutching his arm. He’s still in the black suit, except it’s worn and bloody and torn.“Goddamnit!” Beck hisses. “Get over here!”Another man shoves a bunch of stuff away, dragging over a box of things- tools, maybe?“Ned, you seeing this?” Peter murmurs, pressing a button on the side of his mask.“Activating Camera,” comes EDITH’s hollow voice. Peter can’t help but shift uncomfortably. “Yep!” Ned says, popping the ‘P’. “EDITH, scan the box and try to identify what’s in it.”“Scanning…” EDITH says. “There seem to be some simple warehouse tools, a computer… I am unable to identify what the last thing is.”“Could you describe the shape?” Peter asks.“Like a rock.”Peter huffs. “ That’s not very helpful.”“What?” Ned asks, alarmed. “What’s wrong?”“I’m just talking to EDITH,” Peter says. “Everything is fine.”At least, Peter hopes so.There’s a long pause, and Peter watches as the guy who isn’t Beck brushes off some dust in a place. “This will be amazing!” The guy breathes, excitement painting his features. “It could perhaps be our biggest scientific breakthrough yet!”Beck just rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Just get us back.”“Back where?” Peter pipes up, and both men glance up. Beck smirks. The other guy pales.“Well, well, well…” Beck says, clapping his hands together. “Peter! You’re just in time. You’ll get to see the grand final!”Peter rolls his eyes, ignoring the fear building in his stomach. “Uh-huh. Like I’m ever gonna let that happen.” He says, flipping down from the ceiling. “So, let's do this the easy way. Hand over whatever is in the box and  maybe I won’t turn you in.”The guy genuinely looks like he’s considering it. Which is good. Unfortunately, Beck just scowls. “Don’t be cocky.”“No, I’m just being honest,” Peter says with a smirk, feigning confidence he doesn’t have.He shoots a web towards the guy, causing the wind to get knocked out of him, stuck to the wall. Peter makes an attempt to shoot webs towards the box, but Beck dives in front of it, a gun out and shooting at Peter.Peter jumps out of the way, the web landing on a nearby piece of equipment.“Shit,” Peter hisses. He jumps onto the ceiling, doing an acrobatic flip as Beck continuously shoots him.Peter ducks out of the way, letting out a hopefully-cocky-sounding laugh. “Is that all you got?”“No,” Beck says with a smirk, and yanks something out of a box, holding it up for everyone to see. Ned gasps, Peter swallows.“What-”Then, a blinding green.
 Can’t believe I fell for it twice. 
~~~“I’m going to need the suit back.”Peter’s eyes snap open, glancing at his surroundings. He’s on a rooftop… surprisingly enough. The sun is blaring down at Peter, and he looks up, and he sees- No .No nononono, no. This  can’t be right.“I- I-” Peter stammers, staring at Mr. Stark, his throat closing up. This is impossible. This is  impossible. This can’t be happening- this- what’s-Oh.Peter’s eyes fill with tears- which is stupid, he  knows this is fake, he knows he knows he knows he knows. He isn’t an idiot. Beck is an idiot, for thinking he’ll fall for it. Peter can feel his skin crawl- he needs to get away, he needs to, he needs-“Peter?” Mr. Stark asks, sounding confus
