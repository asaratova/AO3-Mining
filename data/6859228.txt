Chapter 1: Nightmare
    




Chapter Text
You sat on your bed, back against the wall, with your boyfriend's head in your lap. Your fingers playing with his long dark strands. He'd woken up from a nightmare and you were doing your best calm him. He'd stopped sweating and panting, but was still shaking slightly. Your fingers scratched at his scalp, bending to press a kiss to his forehead.
“You wanna talk?” You asked softly, leaning back. He shook his head slightly and you ran a hand over his cheek, trying your best to sooth him. You closed your eyes, still half asleep.
“It was about you.” Bucky spoke up, voice hoarse from the crying he'd done not five minutes ago. You opened your eyes, looking down at him. He was staring at the wall, a blank look on his face.
“You don't have t-”
“I should though. I do this too much. I shut you out. I don't wanna do that anymore.” He said, metal hand coming up to stroke your own hand. Your dropped your hand lower so you could hold his.
“So what did I do?” You asked, stroking his hand with your thumb. He sighed shakily and squeezed your hand.
“Died.” He stated.
“Oh, well. I'm here right now, so, no worries.”
“I killed you.” You contained your sigh, he had dreams like this often, hell it was hard enough for him to agree date you. He's always afraid he'll hurt you.
“C’mon Buck, you'd never intentionally hurt me.” You said, swallowing hard. An angry looking scar sat on your hip where, when as the Winter Soldier, had stabbed you and thrown you out of the way from his mission. You were bedridden for a few weeks and had a scar, other than that you were fine. Bucky on the other hand, he was absolutely terrified of touching you after that. It took nearly everyone on the team trapping you and him in a room to get him to speak to you. You eventually talked it out and he slowly forgave himself as well.
“I know, but, still.” He said, pressing his head closer to your body.
“Hey, Bucky.” You mumbled. He looked up at you, eyes with heavy bags under them.
“Yeah?”
“I love you.” You watched his lips curl into a small smile, a light pink coming to his cheeks. Bucky took in a short breath and his lips twitched into a bigger smile.
“I love you too.” He said softly, sitting up to press his lips against yours. You smiled in the kiss and wrapped your arms around his neck, fingers tangling into his hair, god you loved his hair.
“I love your hair so much. It's so soft. I love you so much.” You whispered hungrily against his mouth, pressing yourself as close as you could to him. Bucky broke the kiss to tuck his face in your neck, sighing against the skin there.
“You're too good for me.” He sighed.
“You're too degrading to yourself. Sit up Buck.” You said shrugging your shoulder. He did as you asked, but reluctantly. His head hung slightly, hair in his face. You pushed it back, taking his chin in your hand and tipping it up.
“Hold your head high, Bucky. You always focus on the bad things you've done, but you're a good person. Think of the times when you save people.” You said, smiling seeing a flicker of curiosity and happiness in his eyes.
“Say it, ‘I'm a good person.”
“I'm a… good person.” He said it slowly. He himself didn't believe it, but if it made that smile on your face stay he'd say it like a prayer.
You wrapped your arms around Bucky, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
“Can I braid your hair?” You asked lowly in his hair. He let out a small laugh and nodded.
“Sure, anything for you cutie.” He said running his thumb over your cheek. You braided his hair as he rested his head on your lap. When you were done he was admitting soft snores. You smiled and kissed the top of his head and moved to lay down next to him.
His arms wrapped around you on instinct, soft breathing in your ear. You smiled and threaded your fingers with his, gently bringing one to your face, pressing a kiss to it. Bucky pressed his face into your hair, sighing lowly.
