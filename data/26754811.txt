Chapter Text
Chapter 1: Reminiscence	Peter hesitates in his reach. It’s been almost a year since he’s done this, and he’s unsure. This was always something that they did together. Something that brought a smile to his face after a rough day. The memories that surface almost bring him to tears. Still, he continues his reach, grabbing onto the thin fabric string.	He slips the black apron over his head, the word “Come to the Dark Side: We Have Cookies” emblazoned below a smiling Darth Vader mask holding a tray of the baked goods. Then, he begins pulling out ingredients. Flour, vanilla, eggs, and everything else he’ll need for what he has planned. Then, he starts mixing.	The recipe is something that he pretty much has memorized. Something that he’s made so many times before. The process is second nature to him. It takes a bit longer than it used to. Even with his enhancements, two people would still be faster than one. However, it isn’t too much time before he’s placed his creation in the oven.***	When May Parker gets home from her shift, she’s not exactly in the best mood. She was called in to work a double at the hospital, even though she had specifically requested this day off. She couldn’t very well say no, so she went in. Now, she’s coming home later than she should. Peter’s been all alone today. She can’t even think about how he must be feeling.	The smell of chocolate fills her nose as she opens up the door. Baked chocolate. Something that she hasn’t smelled in this apartment for what’s close to a year now. She closes the door, tears beading up in her eyes as she sees Peter, standing in the kitchen. In front of him on the counter, he’s finishing the chocolate frosting on a beautifully crafted chocolate cake. Her hands cover her mouth as the tears spill out. Looking up, her nephew straightens, showing his Star Wars apron that had gone unworn for so long. He fixes her with a sad smile.	“It was his favorite,” he tells her. “I-I just couldn’t go through today without it.”	She runs around the counter, wrapping the young man in a hug.	“It’s wonderful sweetie. He would be so happy that you’ve started baking again.”	“I felt like he was here with me,” the boy sobs. “I-I just miss him so much.”	“I know,” she rubs his head, sniffling slightly. “I miss him, too.”	The stay like that for ten minutes, just crying about the loss they both feel so harshly. Then, they both rub their raw eyes and look at Peter’s creation.	“Cut me a slice, my little baker. I bet it still tastes just as good as when you last made it,” May smiles....	“Happy Birthday, Ben.”
