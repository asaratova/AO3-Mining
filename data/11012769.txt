Chapter 1: Prologue
    




Chapter Text
This is the story about how an orphan died, and found her family. Skye had grown up in an orphanage since she was nine months old; dumped on the doorstep like an unwanted puppy. Skye had always felt alone, unwanted, and unloved. She bounced from foster home to foster home, never staying in one place for more than a few months. The only thing that kept Skye grounded were her SoulMarks. She had two, one on her wrist that said "Don't trust Hunter, that's all I have to say, he's the worlds biggest douchebag." Her other Mark was on her hip. It said, "Love, Bobbi is a menace don't listen to her." Her Marks were the only confirmation that somebody, somewhere loved her. Skye taught herself how to hack when she was fifteen years old. By sixteen, she had gotten her license, bought a van, and left the orphanage forever. Skye travelled the country, hacking companies and exposing dirty secrets.In May 2012, Skye found herself in New York City. She watched in horror as aliens poured out of a hole in the sky; she felt like the world was ending. Then out of nowhere came The Avengers. Superheroes, who rose out of the ashes of this tragedy and saved the entire world. They fought the Chitauri with all their might, Iron Man nearly giving his life to secure the safety of the world.When the dust settled, NYC was in ruins. The Avengers did what they could to help New York recover. They did charity work, and helped rescue workers around the clock. The Avengers gained a giant fan base all over the world. People would cosplay outside of Stark Tower. Skye would admit to cosplaying the Black Widow once or twice herself.Out of the shadows with The Avengers, came something else, SHIELD. In Skye's opinion, a shady government organization that wanted to control everything and everyone. New York wasn't her first run in with SHIELD. When she first learned how to hack, she hacked into the Child Protective Services database to find her file. She had hoped to find her parents. All she found was a single file, redacted by SHIELD. Skye wandered for awhile after that, not sure what to think. After The Battle of New York, she knew what to do. It was time to infiltrate SHIELD, and find out the truth.
