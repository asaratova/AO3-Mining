Chapter Text
The sound of footfalls on pavement was the only sound echoing through the courtyard of the Avengers compound. The Dora Milaje formed a semicircle in front of the former Avengers, putting on a good show of protecting the king, when in reality they were tasked with watching the former Avengers.T’Challa walked several yards in front of them, approaching the compound doors confidently. Access to the compound was closely monitored, so Steve and Natasha assumed they would have to wait to be given access, but were surprised when, instead, T’Challa flashed a holographic ID card to a camera above the doors, and they were allowed to enter.“King T’Challa,” FRIDAY greeted, warmly, “I’m afraid Boss is dealing with a personal matter right now, but he will be in shortly to—“FRIDAY cut off, and there was a short moment of silence before chaos erupted in the entryway. First, there was the jingling of metal, and the racket of claws on hard flooring, and then:“STEVEN!”Steve stood to attention, confused but ready for a fight, as Tony’s voice rang through the compound. But, it quickly became apparent that Tony was not talking to him, as he finally came into view, sprinting after a large black dog.“STEPHEN! Catch the damn dog!”Just as Tony passed T’Challa and the former Avengers, an orange portal opened beside him, and a curly haired man stepped out.“I’m trying!” The man, Stephen, exclaimed, sharply, as he stepped back through the portal, another one quickly opening further down the hall.This time, he seemed to have appeared in the right place, and the dog skidded to a stop in front of him, panting. Stephen raised his hands, as if in surrender, moving forward very slowly.“Alright, girl…” he began.“She’s dripping all over my floor!” Tony screeched, quietly.The wet, clearly freshly washed, dog’s ears perked up, and she turned her head suddenly, looking at Tony intently. Tony quickly paled.“Oh, shit.”Stephen dove past the dog, towards Tony, bringing up his cloak to shield them both. The dog shook wildly, spraying water in every direction. When she finally stilled, Stephen slowly lowered the cloak, eying the dog wearily.“Little shit knows exactly what she’s doing,” Tony said, scowling.The dog barked, once, as if in reply, and then began panting happily, tongue dangling out of her mouth. Stephen laughed, loudly, warmth lighting up his eyes. Tony rolled his eyes, not covering up the fondness within them, and held out the end of the leash he was holding.“You’ve had your fun, dear, c’mon,” he said, gesturing for the dog to come to him.She did, without protest, and he slipped the leash onto her collar. As he straightened back up, T’Challa cleared his throat, drawing their attention.“T’Challa!” Tony’s exclaimed, seeming genuinely pleased to see the king.A smile grew on T’Challa’s face as they met for a handshake, which quickly devolved into a hug.“FRI, you didn’t tell me they were here,” Tony said to his AI, inquiry clear in his voice.“You were otherwise occupied, Boss,” she replied, amused.Tony smiled sheepishly.“Sorry about that. My protégé found her in front of Stephen’s sanctum, and fell in love. Now I have to keep her around, lest I break his heart,” he commented lightheartedly, passing the leash off to Stephen in a familiar gesture.Tony opened his mouth to continue speaking, but was cut off by another throat clearing, this time, by Steve. Slowly, Tony’s eyes moved over to him. He pulled his yellow aviator sunglasses down, and peered over them, as if to see him better.“Oh, that’s so not my job,” he declared, condescendingly.Just as he said it, a sharply-dressed woman with a sleek black bob walked into the entryway.“No, it’s mine,” she said, formally.“Hope,” he said, relief evident in his voice.She came to stand next to him, looping and arm through his.“This is Hope Pym, she’s currently acting as my P.A., as well as being an active member of the New Avengers roster,” he introduced.She reached out to shake King T’Challa’s hand, before nodding detachedly to the rest of the room.“Pym? Is it sound business practice to trust your rival’s daughter?” Natasha said, disapproval subtle, but evident, clearly hoping to catch him in a fuck-up.“Hope Pym neé van Dyne, Miss Romanov,” she said, with a finality that suggested this explained everything.“Hope’s mother, Janet van Dyne, was a close friend,” Tony explained, to T’Challa rather than the rest of the room.T’Challa nodded, sympathy clear in his eyes, having noticed the use of past tense, but not wanting to derail the conversation further. Hope returned the gesture.“Moving on to business,” she said, pointedly, “the fleet of cars that will take us into the city will arrive after training, as scheduled. Once in the city, there will be a meeting with the ground teams at Stark Tower.”She turned to Tony.“Give Spider-Man a call and warn him there will be company,” she sa
