Chapter 1: The Captain
    




Chapter Text
_______________________________________________________________
I am alive, I’m just playing dead

I’m gonna say what should have never been said

The giants of the world are crashing down

The end is near, I hear the trumpets' sound

Northern Lights ~ ~ 30 seconds to mars ~ ~
_______________________________________________________________Being dead clearly had its advantages. With nobody hunting him or trying to bring him down Loki should have finally been able to take a deep breath and get some rest. Thor and with him everybody else in Asgard thought that he was dead, so there was nothing to fear, nothing to hide from. Loki travelled between the Nine Realms before he simply stopped and lay down. It was the first time in years that he could close his eyes and drift off to sleep without having to worry about some assassin that might want to slit his throat. So Loki slept and he should have woken up well rested and more or less content.That wasn’t the case.Loki had said it himself – satisfaction wasn’t in his nature and now although he was free, free to do whatever he pleased, Loki was far from being satisfied. During his captivity there had been only two things he had been thinking about. Getting out off his cell and taking revenge. The cell belonged to his past now. It had worked out even better than he had planned, all of his enemies thought he was a rotten corpse, thanks to his foolish brother. Now he could do whatever he wanted. Leave this all behind, go to any realm he wanted to visit, search for treasures, learn new abilities, and find a place where he could stay. All that was within his reach, he could almost taste a new life on his tongue. A life he could form any way he wanted to.But Loki didn’t want it.His mind never came to rest, not even a single second. The first night in ages that he should be able to close his eyes in peace and still there was only one thought in his head. He wanted blood. He wanted to hurt them, break them, kill them and savour every second of it. All six of them were his. His to torture, his to hunt down. The so called Avengers.They had beaten him, humiliated him, put him in chains and handed him back to his brother. Just like satisfaction, forgiveness wasn’t in Loki’s nature. Not that they deserved it. Thanks to them and their chains Loki had had a lot of time to ponder. To imagine their sweet cries of agony which he would pull from their lips. It has been way too long since the last time Loki had used a dagger. When he had pretended to actually stab Thor he had been so tempted. His fingers had itched to dissolve his own illusions and to bury his favourite weapon in Thor’s flesh. Maybe that would have been able to satisfy him. The mere memory made Loki’s whole body tingle and he felt regret. His decision had been the good one, he chose to scheme, to get away, and to free himself from his chains. So he had pulled the wool over Thor’s eyes who hadn’t disappointed. Thor would never stop falling for his illusions. He did even more than that, he spread the word. By now he had probably told the Avengers about his passing. They would feel secure, one potential enemy less to fight. Loki didn’t care. His revenge would only taste sweeter when they didn’t see it coming.This time Loki would be himself. He would be smart and he would do things his style, not the Other’s. Not some loud, painfully obvious invasion. Loki could be subtle, he was sneaky and he was the God of Mischief. So he would do what he did best. Instead of bursting into the quarters of the Avengers and attack them with brutal force Loki would plan things out. One thing he already knew for sure – he would not make a show out of it. People may think him arrogant and Loki was, but he was absolutely able to learn from his mistakes. He had to admit that he would definitely enjoy taking them all down at once, making the others watch while he killed the first one. Again, just thinking about it filled Loki with joy and excitement, but he forbid himself immediately to pursue that thought any further.No, he would be better this time. Think ahead. What’s the use in being dead if he didn’t use it to his advantage? So no, there was no way he would face them in all his glory and show them what they were in for. The Avengers wouldn’t know who they were fighting. A malicious grin spread on Loki’s face when a plan was already putting itself together in his mind. They wouldn’t even know that they were fighting at all.Loki Odinson had ceased to exist long ago. Now Loki Laufeyson was also dead.It was time that a new villain entered the stage. A villain in the disguise of a friend. ***Loki’s knowledge was embarrassingly limited. Something he definitely wasn’t fond of admitting. When he had arrived on Midgard Loki had been sure that he would quickly come up with a strategy how to bring the Avengers to their downfall, one by one. Unfortunately he realised pretty fast that he barely knew anything ab
