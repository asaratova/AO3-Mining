Chapter 1: Steve and Bucky
    




Chapter Text
Imagine Being Soulmates To Steve And Bucky  For My People  You were born with your hand prints. It scared your mom a little because that meant your soulmates were older than you but not how much older. The first hand print was warm to the touch and a cool blue. The second was cold and metallic. The blue on was on your left shoulder and the metallic one on the right.  You lived for twenty years before joining SHIELD. You took up a assistant job. Assistant for Nick Fury himself. How you got the job is classified. That's how you met Steve Rogers.  "At ease soldier" Fury orders to a panicked Captain America. "Where am I?" Captain Rogers asks frantically his head whipping around.  "You've been asleep Captain for a long time" you say stepping up. You hold out your hand to his trying to look approachable. Fury brought you to calm him because unlike SHIELD agents you don't look threatening. "Please come with us so we can explain." Steve looks at you perplexed but takes your hand. When he does it makes you blue mark heat up.  "So this is where you've been hiding all along. In the future" Steve breathes.  "And you in the past." Steve willingly came with Shield and joined that day. You taught him about the present and he told you about his past. You fell in love cliche enough. There was someone missing though. You showed him the other mark on your shoulder. He has another too but their glaringly different. His belonged to a man named James Barnes. You'd have like to meet him  A whole year later is when you met Bucky the first time.  "Is he gonna live?" a strange voice croaks. You whims round to see a scraggly man standing in Steve's hospital room doorway  "Yeah he'll be okay. Thank god to the man that saved him" you reply. There was evidence of Steve being dragged ashore but you don't know who by. "That's good" the man says and turns to leave. For some reason you hate to see him go.  Steve wakes up and says Bucky saved him and judging by the description you met Bucky. It isn't until months after that you see him again.  "Agh! Motherfucker!" you scream when the bullet goes through your thigh. You hit the ground hard pain prickling your nerves ruthlessly.  "(Y/N)!" Steve screams but the darkness is already taking you away.  You wake up to your metallic mark freezing cold and a metal hand covering your mouth.  "Sh I'm not here to hurt you" the man attached to the metal hand hushes your almost scream. You nod and he takes his hand off. "You're my soulmate" you splutter.  "I'm just making sure you're okay." It's dark so you can't exactly see but the man or recognizable. "You're Bucky" you state. The man flinches and backs away. You grab his metal hand to stop him.  "Don't go he misses you and we want you. Please stay" you beg. Bucky just sits down in the chair by your bed. "Thank you."  When Steve comes in the morning he's floored and oh so happy. From then on its the three of you together against the world.
