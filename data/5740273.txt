Chapter 1: Introduction
    




Chapter Text
The air in your room was slightly cool on your skin, giving you goosebumps.  You were watching TV after a long mission; some rerun of a Star Trek episode.  Normally you’d be content to sit there and watch the antics of your favorite starship captain, Kirk, but tonight the show just wasn’t holding your attention.  You turned off the TV and lay back on your bed, pulling the thick comforter around you.  Today’s mission had been the same as any; get information from a weak HYDRA base.  It had gone smoothly enough.  They had realized you were there, but they were a bit too late.  You had gotten the documents and were escaping before they could even sound the alarm.  The only injury you had sustained was a small cut on your shoulder, and the knife hadn’t even been poisoned.  Yes, today had been a fairly productive day.  Then why did it feel like you were missing something?            You sighed heavily into the blanket.  You knew exactly what you were missing.  A lover.  You hadn’t been on a single date since you had finally landed a job working for SHIELD, and it was starting to make you a little frustrated.  Even more so since very single Avenger was extremely hot.  It was a privilege to work beside them, and even more of a privilege to have become their friend.  You smiled as you lay in bed and thought about them all.  Natasha had been the first to approach you, and the rest soon followed.  Nat, Tony, Bruce, Clint, Steve, Bucky, Thor, and surprisingly enough, Loki, had all somehow managed to become extremely attached to you over the past couple months.  At first you had been extremely nervous and careful of what you said around them, but then you realized they genuinely wanted to get to know you, you opened up.  Now, you considered them all to be your best friends.  Living in the Avengers tower with them was like a dream; one from which you hoped you’d never wake up.            Speaking of dreams, you should probably head to bed.  You hadn’t gotten more than four hours of rest a night for the past week, and you wanted to take advantage of the time you had back in the tower before your next mission.  You turned on your side and tried to close your eyes.  Nothing.  You just weren’t tired.  Frustrated, you pulled out your phone and scrolled though all the messages you had missed while you were out on your mission.  A few messages from your best friend from high school, and a meme from Tony.  Typical stuff.            You put down your phone and stared at the wall.  You really were feeling lonely.  Sitting up, you glanced around the room for something to occupy your time until you were feeling tired enough to sleep.  Your gaze landed on the book you had been in the middle of reading.             Perfect, you thought as you picked it up and flipped to the bookmark, settling comfortably onto the bed and pulling the covers on top of you again.  The story thus far had been fairly stereotypical, so much so that you could probably guess the entire plot of the book.  Girl has mysterious powers.  Girl thinks she is an outcast.  Girl meets boy.  Boy thinks girl is amazing.  Lots of sexual tension, then some making out.  Girl saves world.  You were enjoying the read, but you weren’t far enough in to discover if the plot was what you predicted. As you continued, you discovered that you were actually way, way off.  You felt a faint heat in your cheeks.            This is not what I was expecting, you thought uncomfortably.  The book was basically porn.  You glanced at the cover again.  There was no indication that there was anything inappropriate, but then you pulled off the cover.  Damned book cover.  Someone had taken this library book and put some random book jacket on it.  You pursed your lips in annoyance, but then stopped.             Might as well try it.            You continued to read, and as you read, you slowly got into the book.  It wasn’t just some dirty porn novel.  It was passionate and arousing and lovely.  You chewed your lip and pulled off the covers.  It was getting a little warm.  The characters in the book were so relatable; you could actually picture yourself as the main girl.  Then you started to picture the love interest as… them.  You your mouth fell open slightly as you continued to read, picturing that certain person as the one making love to the girl.  It was wonderful.  Until the book ended.  It was a very satisfying ending of course, but it left you wanting. You trailed your hand down your stomach and to the waistband of your pajama pants.  You slid your hands into your panties and over your sex, parting your lips to let out a shaky breath.  The wetness made it easy for you to push a finger inside immediately, and you began to slide your finger in and out gently.  Realizing that it wasn’t enough, you slid in a second finger and continued.  You kept going until you were breathing a little harder.  You suddenly noticed how hot it was in the room.  You p
