Chapter 1: Early days
    


Summary:

I posted a couple pictures to Instagram early on, but I had an older phone at the time and the camera was pretty crappy, so I didn't do much at that point.





Chapter Text
The first thing I did with my boys was to recreate this piece of fanart, because I am a giant sap.
