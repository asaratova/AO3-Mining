 He looks perfect, Phil thinks, his entire mind and body thrumming with barely suppressed arousal. Sitting on the couch in front of him, legs splayed slightly apart, is Clint Barton, already down to his underwear and a t-shirt, his smell enough to drive Phil insane despite the hormone patch on his forearm. He coughs, to get Clint's attention, and Clint lifts his head to look at him. “Sir,” he greets and forces a faint smile. “What are you doing here?” There is no surprise on his face, or in his voice. Heat or no heat, he's been trained better than that. Besides, he should know that Phil was coming and why he is here. “You, apparently,” Phil replies and holds up the folded sheet of paper. “Omega Partnering Service contacted me and asked me to come over to your place. You requested an Alpha to assist with your...situation.” “Oh,” Clint says, as if he forgot, and tilts his head to the side. “In that case, sir, get comfortable, because this is going to be a while.” Phil's eyebrows rise at that, but he follows Clint's advice, takes off his shoes, his tie and his suit jacket. The shoes get lined up next to Clint's combat boots by the door, his jacket gets hung over the back of one of the two chairs at the small table, and the tie he rolls up and places in his briefcase. “You came here straight from work, didn't you?” Clint asks, amused. His eyes are bright with fever, he is flushed, and Phil knows that he's been running a low grade fever since before he left for his last mission. He's read the reports, he knows that the heat didn't mess too much with his aim. “You know I did,” he confirms calmly. “Someone has to deal with all of the paperwork you didn't hand in.” Clint chuckles and rolls to his feet. “I finished mine,” he says. “You want it now, or later?” He grimaces. “I better give it to you now, in case I end up breaking your nose later, sir.” Phil has read the file OPS has sent him, the one that tells him Clint never spent more than one heat with the same partner, that he likes to be in control for as long as his heat lets him, and that pinning him down is not a good idea. His last partner tried, and Clint had, in fact, broken his nose for it. “You're not going to break anything, Clint,” he says. “But maybe we can start with you telling me why exactly you thought breaking the last guy's nose was such a great idea?” Clint's file is full of notes about how he usually requests an Alpha only when he's already in the middle of his heat, about how he has little regard for his personal well-being in that area. Phil makes a mental note to talk to him about it, later, when the worst is over. Calling in a heat so late can lead to complications, it makes the whole ordeal even harder on an Omega's body than it already is. “I told him to wait. He didn't,” Clint says. He's shifting from one foot to the other, his body twitching and thrumming with barely contained energy. It would be so sweet to get him to all fours now and rub against his slick ass until he begs to be taken, but there is a defensive hint to Clint's stance that tells Phil to be careful, to be patient. For a moment, he wonders if the memory of Loki has anything to do with Clint's twitchiness, but before he can ask, Clint absent-mindedly reaches up and rubs his thumb across his own chest. Phil's thoughts derail and his eyes follow the moving digit as if he's hypnotized. “Do you want me to wait, too?” he asks quietly. Clint stiffens slightly. “Yes,” he says. “I'm not ready for that yet. Sir. And I have rules I need to go over with you, if you want to do this.” In Phil's opinion, Clint is more than ready. His smell is like a siren's song, and Phil wouldn't be surprised to find his ass slick and ready. By all means, Clint should be asking Phil to knot him by now, not talk about rules. It's remarkable, the self-control he is showing, and also a little maddening. However, Phil is a very careful and very patient Alpha. It's no surprise he gets some of the more complicated cases from the OPS. He's good with skittish, inexperienced Omegas, and he's good with Omegas who are deemed a little dangerous and out of control. “Let's talk about rules, then,” he says and sits down. “What kind of conditions do you have?” Clint looks for a moment as if he suspects a trap, but then he follows Phil's example and sits down. “Don't try to pin me down. I mean, not around the wrists,” he says. Phil's eyes go to the faint scars, leftovers from getting caught by the wrong guys, and he nods. “No blindfolds,” Clint continues, and Phil nods again. “I don't care what your medical file says, you wear a condom. And...” he hesitates and bites his lip nervously. “Please don't hate me in the morning. Or after. Sir.” Phil thinks for a split second. He brought condoms, and lube, just to be on the safe side, and he's sure he won't hate Clint after their encounter. They both know what they are here for, after all. “That sounds good,” he says. “Anything else?” Clint bites his lip. “I don’
