Chapter One
Lachlan Williams believed in the cover of darkness and stealth. He also believed in silence, efficiency, and getting a damn move on when you were doing something which could attract really nasty forms of punishment, was probably illegal in four different realms, morally dubious, or all three of the above.Which explained why his foot was tapping the ground with increasing speed and urgency, a scowl marring his handsome features, as the container literally passed through the glimmering portal at the speed of a crawl and all the ogres pulling the goods through were grunting and cursing loud enough to wake half the neighbourhood.His dark elf client stood nearby, arms crossed, a displeased expression to mirror Lachlan’s own on his face.“I thought you said the gateway would be wide enough for my goods to pass,” he commented archly, flicking back a ponytail of bone white hair.Lachlan bristled at the insult. His fingers itched to curl into a fist and punch the arrogant elf in the mouth, but instead, he schooled his emotions and smiled, bright and pleasant. Don’t fuck with me. I’ll fuck you twice over.“Ceroden,” he said using that infuriatingly reasonable tone which drove people mad, “I recalled the agreement was for a gateway large enough to pass through a shipment two by two by three meters long. I don’t know about you, but your container is at least three meters tall and two and a half meters wide. For the additional energy I’m now going to have to expend in order to allow your container to pass through, I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask for an additional twenty percent to my commission.”The dark elf spun on him, ebony, pupiless eyes dark and despairing like the abyss where nightmares were born, darker than the starless night sky above. His wine coloured lips curled, revealing sharp, pointy teeth. “The container is the size we agreed!” he hissed.“Yeah, and your bum doesn’t look fat in those leggings,” Lachlan scoffed as Ceroden’s eyes flickered down and he stole a nervous glance at his behind. “I can get a tape and do some measurements, but you are way behind schedule, and who knows when those pesky Midgardians will hear this racket, wake up and call police. Or else let me put it this way: do you really want to risk SHIELD showing up to seize your goods and make you provide answers to a bunch of highly self-incriminating questions? It’s up to you.”For all that Lachlan was lean and tall and towered over his client, the elf still tried to physically intimidate him, deliberately stepping into his personal space. Lachlan held his ground, maintained his smile, but there was no longer any humour left in the expression, only a cold, disturbing, vicious and murderous edge. He kept smiling that smile until Ceroden was the first to look away.It also helped that Lachlan had an oversized, starved and feral looking wolf by his side who slavered and licked his chops as if the dark elf was going to be the first decent meal he’d had in a decade.“You play a dangerous game, wizard,” Ceroden said lowly.“Of course I do,” Lachlan laughed. “Otherwise where would be the fun if the game was safe and we played by the rules? Now, we are agreed on the twenty percent surcharge?”The elf shot Lachlan a look of disgust but nevertheless nodded. They each reached into their pockets for their smartphones, Lachlan making a mental note that Ceroden was in fact a closet Apple fanboi, and a few clicks later, the bank transfer had been effected.Smug with satisfaction, Lachlan hefted his ornamental cane, stroked the platinum reptilian figurehead with its glittering emerald eyes, and whispered a few Words of power which tore the fabric of reality and perception wide open.The ogres gave a small cheer, and with one last heave, the container passed through into Midgard.Pleased with his work and his substantially bloated bank account, Lachlan felt generous enough to throw in an invisibility charm over the goods and the couriers. “That’ll take you off anybody’s radar for a good six hours. Use it wisely.”Ceroden nodded, cautious, if not bewildered by the sudden change in Lachlan’s mood from downright bloodthirsty mere moments ago, to the jovial and magnanimous spirit he now felt. “It would seem Malvavan was correct. You do fulfil your end of your bargain and you don’t ask unnecessary questions.”Lachlan shrugged, long and slender fingers idly running through his pet wolf’s mane. “I just open doors,” he said airily. “Who goes through, and what they bring with them, is entirely not my damn business. Keep your presence and activity discrete and don’t rock the boat. We all have a good thing going on here. As long as the Midgardians remains ignorant of who we are and what we’re doing, then we’ll all be doing just fine. Capiche?”The dark elf frowned, unfamiliar with the Midgardian colloquialisms, but inclined his head in the barest form of a nod and motioned for his crew to depart.Lachlan stayed behind, lingering in the shad
