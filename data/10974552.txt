Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“So run it by one more time please. I was too busy picking an outfit for Y/N.” Natasha looked at you and smiled, scrolling through her phone.“Seriously? Why do I feel like you’re looking forward to this more than me?” You replied, giving Steve a stare that only meant he’s in trouble.“Because I finally don’t have to be the only one doing this shit. Another sexy girl on the team means more time for me somewhere else.”“Whatever. Can you please pay attention now? I want to get this over with.” You took the phone away from her.“Steve if you please.”“Alright. In a couple of hours, General Ludvig Gustav will be having “dinner” with HYDRA agents at The Blue Moon. He’s handing them intel on drive. Y/N and Nat, you will be first on scene. Bucky will be in the back out of sight. Sam and I will be waiting in the alley. Now, Nat will be close by so just go to him, get the flash drive and leave. Don’t do anything stupid. Fight if necessary. Bucky and Natasha will be your eyes and ears the whole night. Any questions?”“Ya.” Natasha immediately replied.“What?” Steve looked annoyed.“Can I pick the song for Y/N?”“Fuck you.” You gave her the phone and left before she asked any questions.“Where’s Barnes?” Natasha asked while collecting the papers with Steve.“You know. The moment he knows Y/N is in the room, he refuses to come. I don’t understand why he can’t just go ask her out even though she likes him.”“Well he’s blind so…”“I hope you’re right and this plan of your works. Normally, I would not agree to using an operation to do this sort of thing but I’m dying from the sexual tensions between those too.”“Don’t worry it’ll work. YES I found it! Look at this.” She showed Steve the outfit and he blushed.“She’s going to kill you. Isn’t that too revealing?”“You’re such an altar boy. This will work. Trust me.”“Go get ready then. Meet there in 4 hours.”“See ya.”Walking to Bucky’s room, Steve saw Bucky walking out. “Hey is the meeting over?” Bucky asked looking at his watch.“Cut the crap man I know what you’re doing. Listen, we’re meeting them in a couple of hours. You’ll be inside in the back making sure nothing goes wrong with the plan. Natasha won’t be that far and Y/N will be-”“What do you mean Natasha won’t be that far? I thought she’ll be getting the drive?”“Change of plans. Y/N will get it and Natasha will standby.”“What the fuck man? Why would you put her in that position? It’s dangerous and he’ll take advantage of her. She’s not a pro yet. I gotta go talk to her.” He was about to walk out when Steve held his arm.“No. She’s more than capable. Not changing plans again considering they’re probably on their way there now.”“Steve you know how-”“Which is why you’re waiting in the back. You will not do anything unless the mission goes south. Understand?”Bucky said nothing.“Understand?” Steve asked, almost ordering him to back down.“Ok.”“Good. Now go get ready.” And with that, Steve walked away, quickly texting Natasha that the plan is working and Bucky is already jealous.4 hours later, you were in the dressing room, mentally kicking yourself for ever agreeing to this. The outfit Natasha bought should not be considered as clothing. It wasn’t hiding anything and you feel self-conscious. What made it worse was you had to approach the General in front of Bucky. How were you going to keep your cool when you know Bucky is watching?This was going to be harder than you thought.You took one last look in the mirror, regretting that you agreed to wear this. Not that you looked bad. You might actually pull this off after all.“They’re here.” Bucky spoke through the earpiece. You were more nervous than you thought. You kill people for a living. You could do this.“On your left when you get out. Song will play in a minute. They’ll introduce you now. Get ready and try to catch their attention.” Natasha said and you thought you could hear her smile. Bitch!“No pressure huh?” You laughed nervously.“Exactly.”You could hear the club owner introducing you and walked to the door.“Presenting your favorite, Lolaaaaaaa Dom!!”“Nat you’re fucking dead.” You spoke while walking out.“You know you love the name.” She laughed at your facial expression when you walked out. You instantly wanted to see where Bucky was but figured it would be a bad idea if you saw him.Bucky saw you walking out and took in a breath. That outfit. FuckReaching the end of the stage, the music started and you couldn’t help but appreciate Nat’s taste in music. It was suitable.You started gyrating your hips, exaggerating the movement to the beat of the song. Bending over, you arched your back while standing up, dragging your hands over the lace material of your lingerie, stopping right below your navel.
