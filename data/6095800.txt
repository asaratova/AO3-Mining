Chapter 1: Holding Hands || Stanford Pines x Fem-Reader ||
    




Chapter Text
Holding hands was something that Stanford Pines did not do, it’s not like he was a prude or something. He just was scared, he actually had a nice relationship for once [well it was his first but he’d never tell you that]. He tended to keep his hands behind his back whenever he was with you, he didn’t want you to think he was some freak. Ford knew you did not that that way since you told him thousands of times but what if holding his hand was the ice breaker.He knew it was stupid, to be scared of losing someone because he hated his features but he couldn’t help but feel that way. Ford was bullied for as long as he could remember for having six fingers. Hearing his name the man looked up only to see you leaning on the table with that smile on your face.Grinning you made your way over to the older haired man, watching as he adjusted his glasses out of nerves. You happened to think that was cute, though your smile vanished seeing him then place his hands behind his back. Shaking your head you then decided to do something about this, you hated that he thought so lowly of himself. “Ford, come here okay”Grasping his hand you then waved your fingers through his then smiled letting your thumb glide over his extra finger. “How many times do I have to tell you that I love you Stanford that means I love everything about you.”Glancing down the man then looked at your entwined hands then he felt a smile come to his face.“How about we go for a walk, I have some lost time I need to wake up for not holding your hand.” Ford stated though gripping your hand as he pulled you out of the shack, the man intending on holding your hand tightly as his six fingers gripped yours."See this isn't to bad now is it?" Smiling you looked up at the man, happily leaning into his arm.Though Stanford didn't think he could be this happy, well he was happy when you actually agreed to date him but this, he knew that he shouldn't think low of himself just because of his six fingers. You, his brother, Mable and Dipper were proof of that, and all it took was you just reaching out and holding his hand.
