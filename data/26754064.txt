Chapter 1: Knifeplay: Leon/Krauser
    




Chapter Text
Leon squirmed, his veins scorched from the adrenaline that coursed through the muscle of his body—the veins. Cuts. The tiniest of cuts and scrapes littered the tight, compressed top he had worn - every breeze blown, strong or soft, brushing against him unkindly. He struggled under the grip of his foe, the beret-wearing fuck having drawn the tip of his blade along Leon’s clavicle. “What’s the matter, Leon...?” The blade moved with a painful degree of slowness, pressing nto his skin. The feeling drew gooseflesh to the forefront of Leon’s already sensitive skin. Too sensitive. He was enveloped with a horrid euphoria, his body kissed by the faintest shudder.And the blond... grunted. Simply that. No wit, no comeback, no ounce of snark. It disappointed Krauser, in a way. With a mild look of despondency upon his scarred features in light of that, still he cooed. “Not like the old days, huh-“Leon grunted twice more, eventually finding the words. “Screw you, Krauser.” Short, simple, sweet. Almost naive in a juvenile sort of way - something a goody-goody two-shoes might remark. A grin spread across the dryness of Krauser’s lips. And he tightened the grip around his man. Classic Leon. Krauser jabbed the knife through the thread along his captive’s shoulder, then, cutting through the form-fitting embrace of his top even further. More of it fell away, unveiling the broadness of his bare shoulders and the fresh cuts along his biceps and soon enough, Leon’s pectorals. Krauser chortled. “That’s better!”Again, Leon struggled in his grip, the man’s body fraught in the paradoxical haze of want and distaste. “Desperate to win this time?” he snapped. “Always trying to one-up me, and still a sore loser!”The blond broke free. Just briefly. The men struggled thereafter as Leon crossed his rival with a harsh elbow to the jaw. He went to trip him, but the mercenary moved with a precision he was not prepared for. Krauser spinned him around and, now, he held Leon from behind, keeping the blond’s arms bound behind his back. With the mercenary's pelvis brushing against Leon’s backside, the knife returned, happily grazing Leon’s jaw and down his neck. “Careful, Boy Scout, don’t want you to finish too early again.” Krauser flicked the blade across his cheek, leaving the tiniest cut. He thumbed the wound gently, wiping some of the blood that begins to spill forth. “That’s for talking back to me.”Leon’s composure began to falter. With his shirt torn to shreds his chest was now fully bare - the man was on fire. Irate, ashamed. The feel of a particular hardness brushing against the cloth of his ass made him shudder. Leon braced a hand against Krauser’s forearm, griping it tightly. “What’s the matter, Krauser,” he mirrored. “Not... getting treated right elsewhere? Heh... I forgot you were nothing but a dog - always needing someone else to take care of him!”Krauser snarled, a surge of weakness spreading through him as he threw Leon back. ”SHUT UP!” A surge of false bravado replaced that feeling, spreading through him, through both men—and Leon could do nothing but smile wickedly. Now free—for the moment—the latter knife-wielder was granted ample time to cut his foe down. Once and for all.The clink of steel echoed across the withering walls and rusting steel of the factory. Silhouettes dueling amidst the backdrop of light, shafts shining over them. There was a hungry look in Krauser’s eyes still. He laughed loudly. “Look at us! Just two shirtless boys, having a bit of fun..”Their knives kissed, the screech of metal touching but a minor inconvenience to Leon’s hearing. Krauser swiped - once, twice, thrice - and was promptly decked. The mercenary was... offset now, a mixture of rage, arousal, and shame withering any further move. Leon was keen to take advantage. Krauser’s chest bore the brunt of several swipes, blood trickling faintly from the fresh wounds. Still, Krauser met him with several blows - a jab, a cross, a harsh knee to his sternum. The bastard never pulled his punches. Not then, and not now. To Leon’s chagrin his knife was knocked away, spiraling until it stabbed into the wall from the force alone. Before Krauser wet his lips greedily, gunfire had begun to rain suddenly—focusing upon him. The mercenary barely scraped by, summersaulting out of her line of sight....he was gone, with a laugh. But not before the mercenary shared a harsh few words with the lady in red. Leon hated Krauser, despised the man.But her...Leon rubbed at the wealth of muscle along his bicep, his eyes moving to meet her smoldering gaze. She stood on high, leant against the railing from the catwalk above. Ada smiled, drinking in the view of his figure. “Sorry to... interrupt, but is that for me?”A shade of crimson spread across Leon’s cheeks in light of her appearance. When he looked down, finding the imprint in his trousers. His body burned hotly as she let slip a hungry, devilish chuckle.
