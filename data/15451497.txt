Chapter Text
"Look Pete, I don't even know why you chose to fly in on a plane when," Sam looks around taking note of his surroundings, "you know..."
"You're going to be at the airport, that's all I asked, we're boarding in ten and should be there soon," Peter replies.
"Fine," the human rocket sighs.
~~~Later~~~
Peter gets off the plane and begins looking for Sam, it only takes him about two seconds to spot the big, bedazzled sign, reading “NERD”, and the smirking teen holding it.
"Jerk," the wall crawler hits the other in the shoulder.
"Nerd," the human rocket bumps shoulder with him.
"Get a room!" Another patron of the airport calls.




Notes:

No Incest(That includes adopted), no OCs(reader accepted but I hold the right to decline them), no aunt May, no Logan(I'm sorry, but I can't write him worth shit and I don't want to ruin it), no cheating(if they are in a relationship in the canon and you have a different ship for them it doesn't count)  I Take Requests Here.
