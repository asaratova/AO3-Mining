"This is not going to end well," Steve said, looking at Peter out of the corner of his eyePeter grinned, "Too late to back out now,"
Ten Minutes Earlier
"Yo Brooklyn," was all the warning Steve got before a skateboard was slammed down on the table, mere centimetres away from his fingers.Steve, who before this had been quietly trying out some new graphite, couldn't help but flinch back in fright."What the fuck, Queens?" Steve asked, running his hand down his face in an attempt to school his expression into something that didn't scream 'you scared the shit out of me'.Peter beamed, "Well, I was wandering through the construction area on floor fifty-one and I saw something that gave me a wonderful idea,""Was the idea that you maybe shouldn't be in the construction area at midnight?" Steve replied"Shut up Steve, no one asked. And you have grey stuff on your face," Peter waved him off, ploking himself down on the floor next to Steve before continuing, "As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, is that I have a wonderful idea,""Wonderful is subjective," Steve mutteredPeter just rolled his eyes, "Well, there's a ramp that I think they're using to shift machinery, thing is, the ramp is angled so that it goes off the side of the building. My idea was, I could skateboard off the ramp, shoot a web to the side of the building and pull myself back up,""I hate that I genuinely want to do this," Steve sighedPeter laughed and stood up, offering Steve a hand, "It won't have been the dumbest thing we've done. Besides, web safety protocols, am I right?"Steve grinned, "We're idiots,""Never said we weren't," Peter replied, already halfway out the door"It felt worth repeating,"By the time they'd made it down to floor fifty-one, Steve had already voiced several more half-hearted protests and Peter had listened to precisely none of them. That was how they found themselves standing in front of the ramp, looking out over the skyline and contemplating the idiocy of what they were about to do."This is not going to end well," Steve said, looking at Peter out of the corner of his eyePeter grinned, "Too late to back out now,""Not really, we could always go back upstairs, I could finish my drawing, you could work on that AP Calc assignment that's due tomorrow," Steve bargainedPeter's nose scrunched up in disgust, "Absolutely not," he said, and before Steve could say anything else, the wheels of the skateboard hit the floor and Peter was off.He approached the ramp with speed, a look of uttermost focus on his face as he launched himself up it, growing nearer and nearer to the tantalising lights of Manhattan, but with metres of the ramp left, he started losing speed. If looks could kill, everything in a hundred-kilometre radius would be six feet under as Peter began to roll backwards, eventually coming to a stop next to Steve, who was doubled over laughing."It's not that funny," Peter sighed"Yes it is, you should see your face!"Peter glared at him, "I almost had it! I just need something to give me a boost at the end,"Steve made a show of thinking for a moment before raising his arm and pointing towards where a shiny new fire extinguisher was mounted, "What about that?"Peter's grin was downright evil, "Perfect,"Steve went over to the fire extinguisher and freed it from its bracket on the wall, "I'm thinking you should Fast and Furious it,""Like, only turn it on at the end for a boost?" Peter asked as he accepted the fire extinguisher from Steve's hands"Yeah, just something extra to get you over the edge," Steve replied"Cool," Peter positioned the fire extinguisher under his arm, the same intense look of focus taking over his features as he eyed the ramp, "Let's do this,"He pushed off, unencumbered by the extra weight as he propelled himself towards the ramp. At the last moment, he turned the fire extinguisher on and, in a cloud of white foam, disappeared off the side of the building with a delighted whoop.Steve ran over to the edge and looked down, grinning as he saw Peter hanging from the side of the building, fire extinguisher and skateboard tucked under one arm as he climbed back up."That was so freaking cool!" Peter exclaimed as he pulled himself up over the ledge"It looked it," Steve agreed, taking in the foam covering the ramp (and Peter)"You should have a go," Peter suggested, all but shoving the fire extinguisher into Steve's arms"But I can't skateboard, and how will I catch myself?"Peter waved him off, "You skateboarded just fine when MJ and I tried to teach you last week, and I'll attach a web to you and pull you up,""I feel like it should have taken more convincing, but what the hell, I'm in," Steve shrugged. It looked fun, and he'd survived jumping out of planes without parachutes before, he'd be fine."Awesome," Peter smiled, handing Steve the skateboard.Steve took it, briefly wondering why he'd agreed to this, before shaking his head and walking over to where Peter had started from before."Just stand there for
