𝙄𝙩 𝙨𝙩𝙪𝙣𝙜.~*~Tony’s life had never been the best. Just 4 years old and he questioned the people around him. Because he didn’t understand.Jarvis said that apparently other children didn’t get kidnapped every other week. He said it was because Tony was rich and that people were jealous. Tony didn’t understand.Ana said that it was because Tony was smart and that people didn’t like that he was smarter than them. Tony didn’t understand.Maria said it was because Tony was Howard’s son and that lots of people didn’t like Howard. Tony didn’t understand.Only a week later, Magnolia, his nanny at the time, kidnapped him. She was going to sell him to Howard’s rivals. Tony escaped.Tony understood, for the first time (definitely not the last). In MIT with Sunset and Tiberius, Tony understood.
In that cave in Afghanistan with Ten Rings, Tony understood.
In the Malibu Mansion with Stane, Tony understood.
In the Grand Prix with Vanko, Tony understood.
In the Stark Expo with Hammer, Tony understood.
In the Chitauri Invasion with SHIELD and Loki, Tony understood.
In Rose Hill with Killian and AIM, Tony understood.
In his Stark tower penthouse with ULTRON, Tony understood.
In Sokovia with the Iron Legion and the Maximoffs, Tony understood.
In the Civil War with Romanoff, Barton, Wilson and Maximoff, Tony understood.Siberia.Siberia really drove the point home. In Siberia with Steve and Barnes. Tony understood.~*~It stung. Waking up from a coma was numbing. Telling his Pep and Platypus what happened was tiring. Reassuring the kid (and himself) was calming. Telling Happy he wanted a cheeseburger was teasing. Assuring Vision that his ‘get well soon’ soup was (honest to god) good was heartwarming. But after Helen and her team injected him with Extremis and left him to rest. It stung. Not the liquid fire running through his bloodstream though.He had 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘥 Steve. He trusted so many people in his life yet here he was in a private hospital room with a loving Pepper, a caring Rhodey, a frantic Spiderling, a gentle and kind Vision and an exasperated Happy. Only 5 people, well 6 if you count the worried Harley in Tennessee. He looked around in the room and saw the people he trusted.Even Helen who was watching from her reports as Peter rambled about how his patrol went with a fond smile. He breathed in. The air felt cleaner than it had since his time with Jarvis and Ana. He remembered thinking, ‘𝘐 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳’Who was he kidding? Of course he would recover. He was Tony Stark, The Merchant of Death, he’ll be damned if he went out with a whimper and not a bang. He’d give Rogers hell. But that can wait, his family is more important.~*~Tony moved on, it shows.Here he was at home in Stark Tower with his newly appointed 𝘸𝘪𝘧𝘦 (made his inner consciousness giggle with giddiness every time), Pepper, who was comfy on the couch with her ever-growing baby bump (Tony was s q e a l i n g) getting tips from Laura. Rhodey was pacing, he was back on his feet, while he was on the phone with someone. Happy was dozing off on the armchair peacefully. Peter, on the ceiling (kid was going to give him heart attacks!) doing his homework and Vision was experimenting in the kitchen. Tony recovered. ~*~Tears sprung to his eyes as a loud cry and a scream filled the room.The hand holding his loosened. . . . “Congratulations Mister and Mrs. Stark. It’s a girl.”And Morgan Ana Stark was born.~*~Morgan squealed in delight as she, May, Peter and Happy played with her toys. Pepper and Tony shared a look of fondness as they watched their family.Things finally seemed to be looking up in Tony’s life.~*~ 2 years after the ‘Civil War’ and the Rogues were coming back. Tony only grinned.~*~Tony hadn’t been expecting to be at the Compound when Rogers and his groupies arrived. He had a meeting scheduled and was supposed to be in at the tower. Morgan was sick so he decided to stay and take care of her.He still attended the meeting though, just through video call. He wasn’t like his father, he couldn’t leave all the parenting to Pep especially when tension was high with the Rogues return.And besides, he was looking forward to this.~*~Tony stepped out on to the tarmac as the Wakandan jet came into view. He dressed in a deep red button up with a gunmetal gray vest, a pinstriped blazer and matching slacks. Red-tinted EDITH glasses? Check.Yep, he was dressed nicely. He wasn’t going to let them take advantage of him this time.Carol squared her shoulders as the jet nearly touched down, “Are you sure I’m not allowed to punch Rogers in the face?”Rhodey tried and failed to hide a smirk when he said “Carol, we talked about this.”The woman just huffed.Tony hadn’t bothered to hide his snickering… or his cooing either.(Tony had been reluctant to let the new recruits in and to his credit, he didn’t. They just wormed their way into his stone-cold, mechanical heart, and apparently they like the interior designing that his family picked and decided to stay. In his heart, without his permission
