Chapter 1: i.
    


Notes:

WARNINGS: Due to the fact that this movie takes place in 1912, there unfortunately are some aspects of period-typical racism, homophobia, and sexism (though never as a result of Steve's, Bucky's, or any of the positive main characters' thoughts or actions, just to be clear). None of these things are portrayed positively in any way when they occur; rest assured, they are all depicted as injustice and negative, like they should be. But due to trying to keep things as historically accurate as possible - as much as I can given my parameters I'm working with anyways - they are themes that unfortunately come with the territory and shouldn't be ignored. **I know in terms of historical accuracy, Sam unfortunately wouldn't have been able to board the Titanic in the first place (it is my understanding that there was only one black man who was believed to have been on board the Titanic, named Joseph Laroche), but as the commissioner specifically requested that Sam be the role of Steve's best friend in this story (replacing the role of Fabrizio from the film), I had to bend that historical accuracy to make this possible.

(If this is something you would like to discuss with me further - say, you don't feel you fully understand where I'm coming from on this and would like some clarification, you are absolutely more than welcome to come and message me on my Tumblr. If you would like our conversation to remain private, feel free to either tell me upfront, or place an asterisk (*) at the beginning of your message. :)

***These themes do not make up the majority of the story, but there are still moments where they are present. For example, there is an instance of two back-to-back racial slurs used by a drunken man with reference to Steve and Sam (*the slur directed at Sam is only insinuated, rather than explicitly said). I apologize in advance if this makes anyone uncomfortable, but this I feel is a fair warning, and so if you know this will bother you, please do not read further.

Additionally, Bucky's relationship with Brock is also incredibly unhealthy and psychologically abusive. There is also a substantial age difference between them; Bucky is 17 while Brock is in his mid to late 30s. In the last scene of this chapter, there's reference to a past instance - that only happened once - in which Bucky had mistakenly decided to sleep with Brock while still in mourning over his father's death. If that squicks you, please skip past it. Also, a necessary warning for Bucky's dangerously close suicidal thoughts at the very end of the chapter.

“I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. 

Titanic was called ‘The Ship of Dreams.’ 

And it was… It really was…”

   April 10th, 1912.In a way, this day should be the happiest of Bucky Barnes’s life. Strip away the glitz and the glamor and the excitement around the ship itself, and at the very least, boarding the RMS Titanic could still be seen as the chance Bucky has been waiting for to finally return home. Almost an entire two months forced into accompanying Brock to England had been two months entirely too long, even with his mother and younger sister present.And yet… He isn’t really going ‘home’, is he? Philadelphia is not his home. Brock’s estate and mansion are not his home. But that’s where he’s going to end up. He has no say in the matter. He never did.This is his life now, of course; fake smiles, fancy clothing, and never-ending conversations about absolutely nothing that serve no other purpose than to bore him to tears. At only seventeen, Bucky can remember a time where he’d honestly entertained hopes of traveling the world, maybe going to school; finding his own way.Once upon a time, Bucky thought he’d have a chance at more.At least when his father had still been around, none of that responsibility fell onto Bucky’s shoulders. The money was always just simply there. Lavished on him, yes, but Bucky always liked to believe he could take it or leave it. He’d been fortunate enough to grow up privileged, and yet in the upscale society that always seemed to be surrounding him, Bucky remained the black sheep.That deep, dark love of wealth – the one that Bucky sometimes suspects runs even deeper than the love a parent might have for their very own child – was never passed on to him. In his opinion, money turns human beings against each other – makes monsters out of even the kindest of people.Still, he’s always felt like he had little room to complain. His upbringing had been a comfortable one while it lasted. Loo
