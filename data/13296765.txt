 For whatever reason, people tended to forget that beyond being the operative known as the Winter Soldier, the man that could tear through empires as the Fist of Hydra, that Bucky Barnes was a trained and highly skilled sniper, first and foremost. Before the fall from the freight train. Before Hydra. Before the Winter Solider.He was highly focused, highly disciplined; perceptive and patient, and that was Before.Seventy years of missions and Hydra training amplified (and arguably maxed out) his already existing skillsets to the extreme, honing them to make him arguably the most dangerous human alive. Steve included.The Winter Soldier was the weapon, but it was nothing without Bucky.For whatever reason, people forgot that.Even dear Natalia; so overrated; so caught up in her own importance and legend. He’d be disgusted at how compromised she’d become since his last encounter with her if it actually mattered to him.But Bucky had more important things to think about, like the man before him.Tony Stark was everything Bucky and the Winter Solider were not: like the sun, Tony was bright and warm and brilliant, otherworldly, but so attainably, uncompromisingly human. It baffled Bucky, actually, for all of Tony’s ingenuity, his genius, strength, determination, and unmatched sheer goodness, Tony was everything that was fallible.He made mistakes; he overshot his marks; he insisted on handling everything himself; he was surprisingly naïve; he was an idealist and a realist existing in one body; he still craved approval, still desired to be liked however much he buried the desire, and he hoped for so much more for others and yet expected so little in return. He carried guilt and regret and loss like well-worn shirts, and he could never seem to forgive himself for the things that weren’t always his fault.But he was still who he pretended to be: abrasive and snarky, the genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist. Tony's ability to play any role expected of him was impressive, even by spy standards, and again, Bucky found himself disappointed in Natalia’s inability to see through it. Overtaken by her hubris and distracted by the sparkle of Captain America’s patriotic propaganda reel, no doubt.However, Tony’s greatest error had been this, them - the Rogues. Tony had overestimated the so-called Avengers; he mistakenly put his trust and affection and love in their unworthy hands and they crushed him, and Bucky could see it, plain as day: A ticking-time-bomb of ego and manipulation, and at its center, the famed genius that shaped the future like putty in his hands, who grew more and more tired as the body count piled up and the blame was laid solely at his feet.For Tony’s sake, as well as his own, Bucky knew that he had to take things slow, so slow it could be considered glacial.He had to.He had his own penance to pay, had accusations he had to face and deal with; he owed Tony that much.After all, the man, even faced with the video of his parents’ brutal murder, still had mercy to dole out: Bucky’s seen what the Iron Man suits can do; knows what Tony is capable of. Tony had been a threat level so high that no one in the underground would even consider playing in his sandbox unless they were willing to go all-in. People that crossed Tony Stark tended to die, and Bucky and Steve would be no exception.Except they had been, and they’d left him in a frozen tundra in an armored coffin without a glance back. Bucky still has nightmares about it.And after the Rogues and he are returned to the United States, the first thing Bucky tells Tony with a sincerity that aches is, "Thank you."He didn’t deserve it, the pardon, the forgiveness for the trouble they caused; a safe place to go to, a home with food and protection, and just - none of it. And what had Tony done? He'd shrugged, careless and tired, and that was it.“You don’t need to thank him, Buck,” Steve had said, almost disapproving, and at the agreements uttered in varying volumes of Natalia’s smirk to Barton's vehemence that “Tony’s a billionaire, what else is he good” for to Maximoff's reminder that “Stark has sins to pay for.”Bucky had been resolved in his assessment: they didn’t deserve him. And, on that note, Bucky wasn’t surprised to find that they didn’t want Tony just as much as he didn't want them.For all the tech Tony offered up for personal weapons, protection, communication, and transport; his money that clothed, housed, fed them and then some; his generosity in still providing for them irrespective of their differences and their cruelty; Tony was rewarded by sneers and jeers and downright disrespect. Even, on the occasion – just the once, Bucky wouldn’t allow it a second time – harm against his person.Bucky didn’t even care that Barton had to be hospitalized, you don’t taunt the man that recovered you from exile and prison and god knows what else, to offer the friendly reminder to Bucky that,“We’ve gotta watch our back, or Tony’ll break it like he did his pal, Rhod
