The Starks and Harley live on their own level but go down to the communal floor for movie nights, good homemade food, and gatherings of all the Avengers. They live at the tower along with the Avengers who Peter refers to as his aunts and uncles. The Avengers with families can live in the tower if they want. Clint and his family live in the tower.
