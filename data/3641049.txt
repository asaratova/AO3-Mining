Chapter 1





Chapter Text
In Avengers tower, all comfortable in the entertainment room sat the Avengers and several SHIELD agents. They sat on the couch and chairs provided; Barton holding a tub of popcorn that Natasha absently ate from. All eyes were on Bruce as he and Tony explained the television system and what it would be used for. For months Loki had been back on Earth causing minor mayhem as he went. Not enough to take him down, but enough to want him under supervision. Not that Loki would ever allow that thank you very much. He would never allow himself to be trailed by some creepy agent. So they had to be sneaky with their attempts. They had to slip by unnoticed.It had not been an easy task. Thor having to go through some hoops and several SHIELD agents scrambling for cover during the course of it all, but it happened. The Avengers now had a live feed of Loki Laufeyson and his plots. All they had to do was turn on the television and Asgard's mumbo jumbo magic would hone in on Loki and they would know what he was up to. He was none the wiser."What if he's taking a piss?" Clint had asked and Steve had looked scandalized at invading Loki's peeing privacy. Bruce had rolled his eyes, adjusting his sleeves."It'll give us exact coordinates. We'll know exactly where he is. He's in the bathroom? Wait until he's out. Fury watched the man his face solemn. Beside his Hill shifted, crossing her arms. Tony sniggered from the couch."Okay so we won't accidentally see him taking a leak...but what if he's in his room? Yeah, he's in his room could be plotting next thing you know, we go in and BAM he's having an orgy and we see quite more of Loki then we anticipated.""As if Loki would sleep with anyone." Natasha replied from beside Clint who grinned."So it's like reality TV. Keeping up with the Kardashians, on keeping up with the Asgardian instead." Tony replied while Thor frowned in confusion."It's only to be used in case we believe Loki is up to something. No spying." Steve stated firmly. No one looked at him. Obviously they were not planning on that. Tony held the remote obviously itching to start. Fury waved a hand at him letting him know it was time to watch. Tony hit the button and they waited as the coordinates were marked and after a moment the screen lit up.A room came into focus slowly. Everyone could see a beige couch and upon that couch sat the God in question, curled up and reading. They watched as Loki turned the page every so often. A coffee table sat in front of him and upon it sat a cup of tea. Loki did not drink from it more interested in whatever he was reading. His haired was mussed and the shirt he wore was too big for his lanky form. They watched in baited silence.Nothing."That's it?" Clint asked while a SHELD agent hushed him."It's not like he's going to be rubbing his hands and cackling 24 hours a day." Bruce murmured, crossing his legs, arms folded. Natasha reached for more popcorn, her eyes fixed curiously on the television.Loki turned a page."This is bul-""SHHHHHH!"Loki turned a page."Nothing's happening." Clint muttered, shooting a glare at the SHIELD agent. They watched Loki brush hair from his face."Well we know that it works. We'll come by later and watch some more." Steve intoned standing and glancing around the room. "C'mon. He's only reading." He prompted. Slowly everyone stood. Everyone but Thor who continued to watch as his brother read."You coming Thor?" Bruce asked as everyone filed from the room. Thor did not look away from the screen when he answered."I shall join you later. I would like to watch him." Bruce nodded, eyes flicking to where Loki read."Okay...let us know if anything happens." He stated, heading towards the door. Thor did not respond.Loki turned the page.
