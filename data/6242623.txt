Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“Ask them.” Tony elbowed Clint in the middle of their video game.Steve was sketching on the couch behind them, while Bucky had just gotten back from the garage and was headed for the shower. He was covered in grease and reeked of sweat. He was supposed to have been home hours ago, but one of the other mechanics had called in sick earlier. Because of that, Bucky did not have the patience or energy to deal with Clint and Tony’s shenanigans. He cast the two a dirty look.“Not tonight,” Clint whispered and ribbed Tony.“You’ve said that the last three nights,” Tony hissed.Steve sat up on the couch. “What has Tony been trying to get you to ask us?”“Why didn’t he ask us himself?” Bucky grumbled. He braced himself against the wall.“Because one of you still carries negative feelings towards me, even though I have been nothing but a gentleman.” Tony pouted exaggeratedly. “You really hurt my feelings, Bucky Bear.”“Time heals all wounds, and as a demon you have more than enough time,” Bucky said.“Bucky’s tired, Tony. You already see what a cheerful mood he’s in. You really want that tagging along with us?” Clint asked.“Tagging along with you?” Bucky questioned.Steve frowned. “Clint, clarify.”Clint sighed in defeat, while Tony punched the air victoriously.“Tony wants to go clubbing.”“So?” Bucky asked. “He can go.”“He wants me to go, but I don’t want to go unless you two come, so…”“He wants all of us to go,” Steve completed. “And I am guessing Tony wants you specifically to go because that way he gets to spend more than an hour at the club uninterrupted.”Tony beamed. “You got it, wonder boy. Although, I won’t lie; I really would like to see you three on the dance floor. Do you take turns dancing together? Form a circle? Just grind up against each?”Bucky sneered, his patience shot.  “You do realize just how creepy and disgusting you sound, right? You're objectifying us.”Tony’s smile faltered, but he quickly plastered it back on. “I’m just teasing you three, Bucky. Besides, the whole reason I’m asking to go clubbing is because I would like to see more than just you three and Clint’s classmates.”“You’ve seen my coworkers too,” Clint pointed out.“Classmates. Coworkers. They’re pretty much the same thing. Everyone bitches about the person in charge. You're just more likely to run it huge age gaps with one scenario more than the other.”“I’m not sure I agree with that assessment,” Steve said.“Whatever. Point is…” Tony vanished and reappeared on the back of the couch. “…I have cabin fever, and I swear if I don’t get out and have some fun for more than an hour, I’m going to go from saying cabin fever to reenacting said song from the  Muppets Treasure Island  movie, and you three are going to be a part of it.”“Can I be Tim Curry?” Clint asked.“No, I get to be him, but I’ll let you be Kermit.”“Curry and Kermit don’t even sing that song,” Steve pointed out.“Why you gotta be a stick in the mud?” Tony aimed at Steve.“I’m just pointing out a fact,” Steve said.“There is a time and place for facts, Steve,” Clint said.“Yeah, Steve.” Tony appeared next to Clint and held up his hand for a high five.Clint slapped his hand.Steve turned to Bucky. “Help?”Bucky shook his head. “I am too tired to get involved in this ridiculous discussion, let alone go out clubbing.”“Just for two hours,” Tony pleaded. “You can leave after the two hour mark and that will give me three hours of fun since I don’t have to leave with you right away.”“You could also stay home, and I’ll go with Clint.” Steve offered Bucky. Steve flipped his sketchbook shut and cracked his back. “Everything I’m drawing is coming out crap. I need a change of scene anyway.”Bucky groaned. He massaged one of his temples and closed his eyes. He didn’t have work tomorrow, and any errands he had to run could be put off until later. “Let me take a shower first. If I can find the strength to put on anything other than sweats, I’ll go with you three.”“You don’t have to.” Steve brow furrowed and his lips formed a thin line; he was worried about Bucky.Steve’s concern warmed Bucky’s insides and gave him the strength to shove himself off the wall and head for the bathroom. “Don’t worry about it. It’s been awhile since I’ve gone clubbing; I’m interested in going. I just need to get my second wind.”“There are some energy bars under my bed,” Tony said. “Really good for taking the edge off. Eat one.” He picked the game controller off the floor and unpaused the game he’d been playing with Clint.Clint squawked and jumped in surprise. “Cheater.” He pounded on his buttons as a race began on screen.“Thanks,” Bucky grunted. He swung by the bedroom for aforementioned energy bar and a new pair of boxers. He nibbled on half of the bar as he waited for the water to warm then saved the rest for later.Bucky sighed as he stepped into the shower and let the warm water wash over him. He spent far longer in the shower than he should, but the water worked wonders on his tired muscles. By the time
