Chapter Text
Steve Rogers was one of the most honorable and kind-hearted men to ever have graced the Earth.Now sure, he was weak and skinny at first, getting beaten up by every bully he tried to fight, but he had a good heart, and he was never going to back down. All he wanted to do was help. And help he would, in any way possible, diseased or not.Counting out his mother and best friend Bucky Barnes, no one really saw the good in his heart though, until Dr. Abraham Erskine, who had selected him for Project: Rebirth, and eventually injected him with the Super-Soldier Serum, which made him a foot taller, gave him six pack abs and muscles, and made him a lot more desirable to look at, and feel too, considering the really pretty red-haired agent known as Peggy Carter had touched his nipple for a second just when he had come out of the machine.Unfortunately, Erskine had been killed right after, but not before making Steve promise that he would remain a good man. So a good man he remained, fighting the good fight against Hydra with Bucky and the rest of the Howling Commandos.There was clearly an attraction between him and Peggy, but her shooting at him had made her less desirable to him.And even if she hadn't shot at him, he hadn't been good at talking to women in his entire life, and the Serum hadn't given him that, unfortunately.So all he could do was inspire, lead, fight and fumble at talking to women.Eventually, he and Peggy had shared one kiss but then he had been trapped under the ice, and when he had woken up, it had been 70 years.The world had moved on, and all he could do was adapt to it.Then within 2 weeks, it was under threat by the Asgardian God of Mischief himself, Loki, and a team of special people was formed by Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, to deal with him.Part of the team were Tony Stark/Iron Man, son of Steve's friend Howard Stark, Thor Odinson, the Asgardian God of Thunder and Loki's adopted brother, Bruce Banner/Hulk, a gamma scientist who could transform into a powerful monster called Hulk on getting angry, Clint Barton/Hawkeye, a well-trained SHIELD Agent and master marksman, and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, another well-trained SHIELD agent with a variety of skill-set and equipment about fighting.Steve hadn't been impressed by Tony at first, mainly because of the man's arrogance and condescending attitude, like when he had called him 'Capsicle' and treated the safety of everyone on the Helicarrier as a joke. But in the Battle of New York, the man had actually put aside his ego and listened to Steve, and proven himself a hero when he carried the nuke through the wormhole, proving Steve wrong about how he wouldn't make the sacrifice play. So while he was hard to get along with, Steve could tell he was a good man with a good heart, flaws notwithstanding.Thor was a warrior and of course, behaved like an ancient person. Steve found him honorable and easy to get along with from the start, and there was clearly a mutual respect between them both. Thor respected and followed Steve, who in turn respected him and listened to him, though that was the case with all his teammates really.Bruce was a shy and mild-mannered man really, but definitely good at heart, and Steve could understand why he was so aloof. Carrying something like Hulk within would be taxing, but at least Hulk helped when the time came, and actually listened to Steve, so clearly, he was his own person too.Clint was pretty cool, and his archery was top-notch, the best Steve had ever seen. That dry, sarcastic sense of humor was amusing, and Steve could get along with him very well. He was good at following sensible orders as well, and Steve knew if he did give a stupid order, Clint would oppose it respectfully, and so would the others.Natasha was kind of a mystery, or well, bigger mystery than most other young women. She was calm, collected and cool around him, when almost all women lost their minds near him. The only other woman who hadn't was Peggy, and Natasha reminded him of her. Both were calm, confident, deadly in battle, and red-haired. And Natasha also was much more mature with her feelings, which he always liked. He could see her eyes were haunted by the past, but she didn't talk about it, and he didn't ask.But while he wasn't totally sure, there was a small chance she was into him maybe. She was the one he had spent most of the time with out of all Avengers, and they just connected perfectly, and talked as if they knew each other's thoughts. She had been assigned to train him in modern combat after all, so that had made them closer.Steve wasn't sure if she was interested in him or not, but sometimes, she shot him a look, which was rather different, and almost, well, aroused. But he didn't think much of it. He would make a me
