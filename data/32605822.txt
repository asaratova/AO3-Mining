Chapter 1: Introduction
    




Chapter Text
Tony was used to the public having a low opinion of him, they had his entire life, so nothing was new there. Of course there have been times where public opinion of him has been high, but after the whole 'Civil War' debacle, a lot of people have turned on Tony, blaming his for tearing the Avengers apart, despite the fact he was one of the only ones willing to sign the accords and he was doing everything in his power to get the so-called 'Rouges' pardoned as he realised that the world needs them. One of the members of Tony's PR department approached Pepper one day with the idea of a short TV show showing the daily life of Tony Stark- the idea behind it being to show that Tony Stark is not the selfish, ego-centric person everything thinks he is, it's like people forget the time he flew a nuke into a wormhole thinking it would kill him in order to save New York. When Pepper first broached the idea with Tony he was reluctant, he had no idea how it would help and didn't like the idea of people filming everything he did. And, despite the numerous times he'd been in the press over the years, little is known about the true Tony Stark and he doesn't know if that's something he wants to share with the world. However, with the persuasion of Pepper, and Peter as Pepper knew Tony struggled to disagree with him, Tony agreed- on certain conditions that is. Nothing confidential about the business or tech could be filmed and if Peter, with him still being a kid, wanted something to not be aired then it's removed and his lab is not to be filmed when he's working on certain projects: for example, Peter's Spider-Man suits as that would run the risk of exposing his identity, something Peter doesn't want yet. A couple of days after the decision was made, it was announced to the world that there would be a few episode show that would air the day-to-day life of Tony Stark. Most were excited to see just what his life was like, although some scoffed at the idea, thinking it ridiculous as they were under the impression that Tony Stark was one of the worst people alive. Pepper and Peter couldn't wait to prove these people wrong and show the world the Tony Stark they know, to show the world the man behind the mask...
