     “Peter!”Peter groaned, covering his face with his pillow. He rolled over to stare at the ceiling, covered wall-to-wall in glow-in-the-dark stars. If he ignored it, maybe it would go away.     It did not.     “Peter, get your ass out here now!” The voice yelled again. Peter lifted his head blearily from the pillow. "Fine, I'm coming!" A couple of minutes later, dressed hastily in a hoodie and jeans, Peter wandered into the kitchen. He was met with a sea of faces turned his way, emotions ranging from highly amused to mildly baffled. The only one who seemed annoyed was Tony Stark, who was currently staring at the teenager, a piece of paper clutched in his fist.     “Were you gonna tell me about the trip, kid?” Tony asked. Peter shrugged. He moved over to the counter, opening several cupboards before he found a slightly-crushed box of frosted flakes. He poured himself a bowl, painfully aware of the silence in the kitchen.     “I mean, it seems kinda pointless?” He said. “I could just stay in bed all day instead…?”Clint and Steve, who had been holding in their laughter, shared smiles of utter glee. Peter glanced between them suspiciously. “Look, there’s really no point, I’m just going to head off…”     Tony snagged his backpack and hauled the retreating teenager backwards. Peter yelped as Tony shoved the form into his hands. “Not a chance. I better see you later, kid.”     Natasha snorted into her coffee.--Peter didn’t exactly have a normal life.     He hadn’t, since he was fourteen and an ill-fated trip to Oscorp had left him with genetic mutations and a small, fang-shaped scar on the back of his neck.     At least then life had mostly carried on like normal for a few weeks, weird powers aside. Then Uncle Ben had died, and Spider-Man was born.     Needless to say, things went downhill from there.     Aunt May, unable to cope with the responsibility of caring for the teenager by herself, had sent Peter away, to live with his godfather and father’s closest friend, Tony Stark. The lifestyle change had been jarring at first, but Peter had gotten used to his new family over the next year or so. When Tony and Steve became Peter’s legal guardians, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.     Not long after that, Peter had told the heroes about his alter-ego, and after a rough couple of weeks, he’d gained his fathers’ acceptance and a new super-suit.     Now, Peter was eighteen, having found a comfortable balance between masquerading as Spider-Man and keeping his grades up (because god forbid Tony Stark’s son be anything less than a genius), with a host of bizarre and mildly dangerous family members surrounding him at all times.     He lived at the Avengers Compound upstate, making the drive to school every day in his Aunt’s old mini. Tony hated that car, but Peter refused to let his Dad buy him a new one.    So yeah, Peter didn’t exactly have a normal life.--Mr Harrington looked more than a little tired as he herded the group of teenagers onto the battered and disgusting bus. Thankfully for Peter, this meant that the teacher didn’t give a second glance to the signature written on the bottom of his form.     Technically, no one knew that Tony Stark was Peter’s guardian. On his emergency contact forms at school, Tony had ensured that his real name wasn’t on them, in case any less-than-honest receptionist sold Iron Man’s personal mobile number to the media or worse. The same went for Steve, who’d been insistent that his number was added to the forms. That had been a weird conversation, Peter thought with a smile as he got on the bus, followed closely by Ned and MJ.     The three friends sat down together, Ned and MJ muttering excitedly about what awaited them at the Avengers Compound. Peter was less enthused.     “Do you think we’ll meet any of the Avengers?” A voice from the row behind them could be heard saying excitedly. Peter buried his face in his hands.     “God, I hope not.”     “Why’s that, Penis?” Someone else exclaimed loudly. Peter prayed the ground would swallow him whole, but to no avail. The smug face of Flash Thompson appeared in his periphery. “Afraid they’re gonna call you out on your bullshit lies? ‘Mr. Stark’s internship’ my ass. Next, you’ll tell me you know every Avenger personally, huh? They’re your best friends?”     Peter looked away, trying to ignore him, and Flash flicked his ear painfully. “Answer me, weirdo.”     “Of course I don’t.” Peter said stiffly. “I’m just an intern. That would be stupid.”     Peter was lying through his teeth, and he knew it. He knew every single resident of the compound, and some who only dropped in every so often, would contest that point fiercely. Still, Peter would rather keep that knowledge to himself than give Flash more ammunition than he already had.     “Whatever. I can’t wait to see your face when they don’t even let you into the building.” Flash muttered, retreating back to his seat. Ned nudged Peter’s shoulder gently, and gave his fr
