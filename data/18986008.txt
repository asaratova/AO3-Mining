Tired Intern  @Number1Intern@OfficialTonyStark OMW PLS DONT LET CIOKNNOR DRIKNK TJATH *Tony Stark  @OfficialTonyStark@Number1Intern jfc chill 
  Thomas @NotBlueTrainSo anyone want to talk about those two? The sitting in chair one and tired intern? Thomas  @NotBlueTrainTbh I dont know Tony Stark now has intern Stressed out @twinklewinkleMe neither. But I think it’s a real deal if Stark himself publicly tweeted him Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouSo I just asked my friend who is an intern in Stark Industries Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouApparently Tony Stark HAS an intern, but never bother to announce it. To quote his words, “sooner or later the world will know, so why bother?” Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouThe entire company 100% believe in the power of netizen i just cant jfksfdkjfdkjfs
 
Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouSo anyway. About this intern. Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouHe, yes its a male, is a real fucking deal. Unlike avarage intern, this one was personally recruited by the Tony Stark himself so of course he is a legit genius Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouThey couldnt tell much because some of them related to corporate secret, but from the snipbits itself I am totally convinced this kid (you kid im not. He is a fucking k i d) at least on par with Tony Stark. Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouOnce my friend with her colleagues were in a pinch because there's a fatal mistake in their but they couldn’t spot the causes for days. But later a kid shyly approached them and asked if he could help them. On that time they all were so desperate and sleep deprived, so they just nodded dumbly and said yes Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouLo and behold. In a span of minutes, he spotted their mistake just by glanced at their coding and corrected it. I repeat, coding. The endless sea of numbers that drived a bunch of adults insane. Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouAs if it wasnt enough, he even added several systems to maximize its performances. Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouLong story short he just saved million dollars project just by several minutes. Thomas @NotBlueTrainWh......what the fuck Thomas @NotBlueTrainIs that even legit Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouAsk @canihaveawaffle if you dont believe me Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleHo ho ho I have been summoned Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleYeah, it is 100% true. You can dm my boss for further clarification Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleUsually we are prohibited to talk about this to public, but Mini Boss was exceptional Kree-man @Brookree@canihaveawaffle Mini Boss? Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleOur nickname to @Number1Intern Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleMini Boss always refused to take credit of his handiwork, so its our job to let the world know how wonderful and adorkable our Mini Boss is Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleI can go to a five-hours rant about how sweetheart this boyo is if im not craving sleep rn but fuck sleep Evan Wood @canihaveawaffleFun fact: we make a joke questionnaire what do you think about Mini Boss. Almost 90% choose ‘adopt’ while the others picked ‘a cool guy/genius/etc’. Here’s the prove: [Link] Arnold da pea @AlmondsCanKillYouFKLJFKLFJDFKDJFDK WHEEZE Stressed out @twinklewinkleTHIS IS THE CONTENT IVE BEEN STRIVING FOR THANK YOU GOOD LORD Evan Wood @canihaveawaffle@OfficialTonyStark beware, boss.
