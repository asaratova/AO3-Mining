Chapter 1: Introduction
    




Chapter Text
Tony wasn’t thinking about Obi. He wasn’t. Tony rarely thought about Obi these days, it’d been over a year and a half since Obi died and that was a Good Thing. Tony needed more Good Things is his life, that’s what Pepper told him and he was inclined to agree. Pepper also told him that she was happy he’d stopped sleeping around; she thought it was because he’d matured after Afghanistan or because he didn’t want anyone to see the Arc Reactor, both were true but they weren’t the real reason. Being with Pepper had been weird, he loved her, honestly and truly, but he couldn’t submit the way she wanted even though he knew he could trust her. He trusted her with his heart – let her change the Arc Reactor – but he couldn’t trust her with his mind. He knew he was broken, and that was okay, but she thought he was just difficult; but she didn’t push too hard, she was gentle and sweet and utterly unfamiliar from his usual frenzied one-night-stands or from his Do- no. No. Obi was dead now; he didn’t have any claim on Tony anymore. He was best left forgotten. So Tony wasn’t thinking about Obi, not right now, instead he was thinking about Captain America – his childhood hero who disappeared before Tony was even born, but he’d been found alive by SHIELD. Alive. After seventy years and from the report he’d been given by SHIELD (and then the security cameras he’d hacked into) Captain America was still as youthful as he’d been the day he took the serum, if a little colder.
 
Tony was prepared for every possibility, You’re Just Like Your Father to You’re Nothing Like Your Father. Because Dad was there the day Mr Steven G. Rogers became Captain America and they’d been great friends right up until the plane crash. Everyone knew that Bucky Barnes was Captain America’s best friend, it was in all the movies, comics, and even documentaries, and most people knew that Howard Stark had worked with the war effort during that time, but with the Super Soldier procedure being classified to ridiculous extremes even now, Howard’s contribution had been kept quiet (Tony had heard that Dr. Banner had to sign confidentiality agreements with six different branches of the government and three with agencies outside of the government before he could even start theorising about ways of re-creating the Serum). There’d been lots of old war buddies at the funeral though, Tony had shaken hands with a lot of old men who said they’d never forget the help that Howard had given them during the war, most were talking about improved weapons; some about being picked up in the middle of a no-hope war zone by a cheerful man with a plane and somehow surviving the flight back to base; but a few told him that they had been part of the Howling Commandos, that they had fought alongside the good Captain and drank with Howard in their spare time. They said he was a great man, a great inventor, pilot, and friend. They said they were sorry for Tony’s loss. Tony thought that this great man must have been lost a long time ago, because all he ever saw in his father was disappointment.
 
Tony knew better now, over two decades later; his father cared in his own way, but not like a father should. He called Tony a ‘creation’ like he was something built in the workshop, like he was a thing and not a person. Well Tony was tired of being a thing, that’s what he was to his father, that’s what he was to Obi, he’s not going to be that anymore, because he’s going to meet Captain America and he’s going to make friends with Captain America and he’s going to be his own person for the first time ever if it kills him. So Tony put on his sunglasses, hopped into Happy’s car with the suit in a briefcase and smiled – because nothing can go wrong.
