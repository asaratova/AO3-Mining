Chapter 1: Clint the Hawkeyed Wonder
    




Chapter Text
Tony Stark was reckless. It was as much a fact of life as grass being green or breathing being necessary for human survival.And, speaking of breathing, he really needed to, y'know, do that.Made difficult by being at the center of a giant, watery-amorphous-mass-creature-villain thing. He did have a plan to rectify that, though, which was good, because being unable to breathe sent him to bad, bad places.That being said, he was extremely relieved when his unibeam went off and the creature exploded. He could vaguely hear the others yelling in his ear, but his mind was stuck somewhere between here and burning, endless sand.And Clint saw that, when he arrived where Tony hit the earth, the first one there. Tony's teeth were clenched tight, pupils blown wide, only the barest hint of recognition in brown irises."Oh, hey, yeah, help me out here, there's a catch on the back of the suit -" he's rambling, trying to keep the demons away. Clint was slow, steady, as he pushed the release button to allow the armor to fall to the ground. Tony's breathing was shallow and fast, hands grinding into his eyes, surrounded by bits of scorched metal flame.Clint felt Tony tense and still the moment his arms wrapped around him. He could feel the billionaire's confusion; noticed the genius's arms were hovering somewhere between pulling him closer and pushing him away.Damn, he hadn't realized Tony was so touch-starved. Even Bruce knew how to respond to a hug or a shoulder to lean on after a fight. Tony, now that he thought about it, was usually the one offering a shoulder, even on missions when they got back and learned, much to their horror, that he was injured worse than any of the rest of them, under the armor, and hadn't thought it was worth complaining about.That had been an interesting Mission, with a capital M.And Tony's mind was just...blank, except for a running commentary of crap, safe now, breathe, we're good, we trust this person, I'm safe, we're home safe and crap, what did I do, is this a hug, oh the horror, what the heck, what did I do to deserve this, no, really, I'm a horrible human being.Clint pulled back and rolled his eyes at the half-confused, a bit reassured (even though the billionaire was trying to hide it), and mildly lost expression on Tony's face. "It's called a hug. You with me, man?""Yeah - yeah - I - um -"Clint took a moment to revel in the novelty of Tony Stark without words, glancing over his shoulder towards Bruce, who was waiting to come over. Thinking about it though, he was a little worried; he definitely shouldn't be able to shortcircuit Tony's brain with a hug, seriously. He gently touched Tony's bloody forehead and raised an eyebrow. "Let's get you to medical." Tony's eyes were here now, but he still had a lost look on his face that made him look like a child in need of comfort. Clint had never, ever seen a look like that on Tony's face.He understood when the masks started to fall back in place, surprised when the 'genius billionaire playboy philanthropist' hid what was so purely Tony. It made him want to cry, a little, realizing that Tony still didn't completely trust them, still wore masks, but that even if he didn't, they'd all still look at him expecting to see Anthony Edward Stark, son of Howard Stark; and the vulnerable glimpse he'd just gotten of the man was enough for him to realize that he couldn't handle all the attacks and betrayals and media scorn without attacking back, without a mask to blame the guilt on."I am not leaving my armor here for anyone to grab," he said. "It has to get back to my workshop, not to SHIELD or the army or a villain. Do you know what that suit could do in the wrong hands, it is the most advanced weapon in the world -" Clint let him ramble for a minute, recognizing the defense mechanism as such now, rather than just mindless lashing out."Okay."Tony blinked, mask slipping a bit. "What?""It's your suit. We'll have to wait for the others, though, which shouldn't be long since I can't hear the Hulk anymore. No way can the two of us carry it all, and then you will let Bruce take care of those broken or cracked ribs.""How -""I'm Hawkeye." he smirked. "I see everything."
