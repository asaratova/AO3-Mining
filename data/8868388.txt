Chapter 1: A Young God Stands in His Bedroom
    


Notes:
Hi, future-author here. I originally began this fic as a fun without plot piece during 2016, but a few chapters in, I thought up of a plot. Years later (and a 2 year hiatus in between) we now have the current state of this work. I sincerely apologize for the wordcount, and I hope new readers enjoy their stay here. This fic has a part / arc structure, so here's a handy guide:PART ONE: SESSION FIVE- Chapter 1 - 10PART TWO: THE NEW YORK CITY WIZARDS TROUPE- Chapter 11 - 22PART THREE: RIOT TENDENCY- Chapter 23 - 30PART FOUR: HOMESTUCK HOMECOMING- Chapter 31 - 48PART FIVE: RAGNAROK CRUSADERS- Chapter 49 - 70INTERMISSION ONEPART SIX: NEW WORLD ORDER(PART ONE)- Chapter 72 - 92INTERMISSION TWO(PART TWO)- Chapter 94 - 115Part Six Post-scriptINTERMISSION THREEPART SEVEN: MANIFEST DESTINY- Chapter 118 - ONGOING




Chapter Text



PART ONE: SESSION FIVE

He enters the flat just in time for something to shatter. It’s followed by Jade’s loud, indignant, “John!” and a door slams open as wind races past it, rushes down the stairs, passes him and slips out the still-open front door, carrying the sound of laughter with it.Loki doesn’t sigh. He does close the door behind him.One of the doors in the hallway opens and the landlady pokes her head out. She looks up, then turns to him. She smiles. He gives a small one back.Jade is cursing upstairs.“Another prank?”There’s a shriek.“Yes,” he says. “Although I am quite curious as to what he’s done this time to warrant such a response.”Mrs. Harrison chuckles. “As long as you paint or repair the walls if he’s done anything to them.”“Then I hope it will not come to that,” Loki says, “Since John will perhaps…see it fit to give the décor his own brand of improvement.”The old lady makes a face.Loki inclines his head slightly before making his way up the stairs. The door to his flat is open, and from where he is, he can see something sticky and pink splattered all over the carpet. Jade is still yelling.John is definitely cleaning the mess up when he gets home.He pauses by the doorway to see Jade sitting on the floor with her hair, ears, shoulders and arms covered in whatever the pink goo her brother has created is. Rose is beside her, gloves on, trying to take out as much of the mess as possible.Jade’s aforementioned ears – the dog ones – flick back as she hisses when Rose accidentally pulls out her hair along with the pink goo.Rose sighs, puts the goo and hair in the plastic bag beside her, and looks up at Loki. She inclines her head politely. “Welcome back, Loki.”Jade looks up too, her annoyed expression clearing up for a moment as she gives a little wave. “Heya,” she says. She pulls a bit of hardened goo and takes her hair with it. She hisses again.“I am going to kill him,” Jade says through clenched teeth as she tosses the gunk into the plastic. Rose hums. “It’ll be a Just death, it’ll stick,” Jade says.“What did your brother do this time?” Loki finally asks, crossing his arms and leaning on the doorframe.“Tripwire,” Jade says, “Connected to a bucket of…this – ” she flaps her arms uselessly to indicate the sticky pink goo all over her shirt. Some of it drips to the carpet. Nobody but John is going to clean that, Loki’s making sure of it. “ – that was hung on the ceiling.”Loki looks up. True enough, there’s an overturned bucket held only by a bunch of thick strings attached to a miniature pulley system.“He calls it Tubby Custard,” Rose adds.Jade snorts. Loki frowns, confused, but doesn’t pursue it.“I think it’s just hot gum.”“Where did he even find hot gum?” Jade seethes. She lets out a cry as another lock of hair comes away with the goo.“Factories, I assume,” Rose says. “He has unlimited access to the city.”“So do I,” Jade says. “I’m making sure he knows that.”“Did the teletubbies puke in here or something.”All of them turn to the hallway, where Dave stands with a plastic bag from one of 7-elevens around. Loki tracks the rapid movement of his eyes from behind his shades as he takes in the carpet, Jade and Rose and then the ceiling.“Egbert?” he asks.The girls nod.“Hot gum,” Rose repeats.“Ugh.” Dave’s nose scrunches up. “That’s nasty.”“He is cleaning this up alone,” Loki says. The corner of Dave’s mouth lifts just very slightly.“I’m making him pay.” Jade goes right back to seething. She crosses her arms, not caring about the mess on the sleeves. The shirt is ruined anyway.Dave moves past Loki, giving him a small nod, and makes sure not to step on any of the gum on the floor. One puddle makes him stretch his legs too much and he almost imbalances, but he quickly moves his feet and he steadies. Loki still doesn’t move from the doorway.“I’m going to go all around Earth and destroy everything that has to do with Ghostbusters.”Dave’s head swivels to her direction. Rose is smiling. Loki lets out an amused huff, lips turning up. He does love Jade’s mean streak when she’s pushed.“Aw, man, you’re gonna break his little nerdy ghostbusting h
