Chapter 1: Wade and Matt
    




Chapter Text
Peter is one hot piece of ass but the kid’s so blushy and modest about himself; he never notices when people are actually making a pass at him. Wade, on the other hand, is not so oblivious. Sometimes he wishes he was, because honestly the amount of people hitting on Peter lately has been getting ridiculous. Before Peter and he became an exclusive item, they were mainly friends with benefits, friends with some serious benefits. But because of their lack of exclusivity, Wade had never been around Peter enough to notice his boyfriend was like- the poster boy- of superheroes. During their platonic relationship, things were good. They had known each other for quite some time, close to three years. And what had begun as stilted, icy confrontations slowly, and I mean slowly, transformed into mutually beneficial combat aid, which then developed into a hesitantly realized ambience of mutual respect, which then somehow became sporadic late night rooftop chats, and then inexplicably became the careful chipping away of pre-erected personal barriers. That was a big sudden step. Okay, so they didn’t click immediately. Can you blame them? They didn’t necessarily have much in common except they both wore red and donned masks. Wade was a well- known killer and Peter was a well- established hero. Deadpool had no use of the law and Spiderman was created to abide by it. Peter’s Spiderman was reserved and textbook, while Wade’s Deadpool was unpredictable and senselessly uncensored. The other Avengers would warn him about him too, saying how unstable and violent he was- basically telling Peter to ‘stay away’ in so many words. But as years passed, their interactions became more frequent, out of sheer chance more than anything, as both of them primarily operated in New York. Their first interaction wasn’t the best. Steve had ordered him convince Wade to stop taking hits on international heroes, lest he be kicked out of NY. Peter didn’t know what to expect, but he did expect some degree of proper communication. But Wade had replied with two strategic shots to Peter’s feet and a middle finger, before slipping away.   Nevertheless their relationship began to grow closer, familiarity becoming a comfort. They’d always catch glimpses of one another atop roofs or in alleyways during the night. Both of them worked alone, every night, unlike most of the other Avengers. Occasionally, Wade would spot him crouching atop some rooftop and shout things like, “Hey Spidey cakes!” or “Hey web head!” Peter would ignore him of course but unfortunately, sometimes Wade was the only company around. It slowly, and inexplicably, progressed to the point where they revealed their secret identities to one another, well, Peter did. Wade didn’t have one which may have been a reason why Peter trusted him enough to take off his mask in the first place. They were on their most visited rooftop, the Oscorp building that sprawled its billion- dollar looming- design high across the sky of New York City and lay eyelevel, only a few blocks away, from the Stark Industries behemoth, the neon blue STARK burnt brightly into Peter’s eyes but he still liked to look at it anyways. Wade had managed to sneak up on him, again, which never failed to unnerve Peter. The mercenary flung his long legs over the metallic, square air duct Peter was sitting on and flopped down close to the young hero. They had just finished taking down a crime mob that had been terrorizing the Bronx, and after any good team up, Wade and him routinely met up on the Oscorp rooftop to hash things out and unwind. Wade had become good, reliable company almost a sort-of friend. “Where you been?” “Aw, been waitin’ up on me Spidey?” teased Wade, nudging Peter’s foot with his own. Peter scoffed, “No.” They were quiet for a minute. Then as usual, Wade broke the silence. “You feelin’ okay Spidey?” “Yeah, I feel fine.” “Thought I saw you get smacked pretty hard on the head, you sure you don’t have a concussion? Concussions are at an all- time high for active young people nowadays.” Peter rolled his head to the side, giving Wade an un-amused look. “I don’t get concussions and I’m not that young,” replied Peter, a bit indignantly. “Sure thing baby cakes.” “Wade seriously.” “Okay well then how old are you?” questioned the mercenary, white eyes narrowing challengingly. Peter exhaled tiredly. “Can’t tell you Wade,” reminded the hero. “Oh right, no personal information, you’ve got one of those pesky ‘secret identity’ things.” “It’s not “pesky,”’ retorted Peter, “It’s important.” “Yeah you don’t need to hero-exposition the whole meaning to me Spidey. I’ll just keep thinking you’re a fourteen year old, very into English and art high school student who lives with his two loving parents who work all the time, but make sure to love and dote on you when they get home after fourteen hour shifts.” A brief snort of laughter escaped Peter, shaking his head amusedly at Wade’s random digr
