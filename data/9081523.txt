Chapter 1: The RAFT
    




Chapter Text
He was hurt.Sure, other emotions are there too, anger, guilt, self-loathing, sorrow, bitter. But most of all, he was hurt.He saw Barton stood up, and the claps came next."The Futurist is here, gentlemen! The Futurist is here.""Give me a break, Barton.""Oh, I'll give you a break, once I'm out of this hellhole."He stopped in front of his cell."You were retired, Barton. I didn't force you to leave your family alone, I didn't asked you to fight against your own friends.""If you think we were friends, think again."Tony didn't let his body flinch. Instead, he stiffened his body and clenched his fist. Well, the one that wasn't wrapped up anyway."I admit, it was stupid of me to think we were ever friends, when in reality I'm just your weak provider. Besides, I wasn't talking about me."Barton scoffed."You always talk about yourself.""Wow. I'm impressed."Tony clapped his hands slowly, it was clear it was just for show."Six years you live in my Tower. Six goddamn years."Barton stopped from pacing around in his cell."What are you talking about?"He got a stare from the billionaire."Six years, and yet you never figured it out.""Figured what out?"Tony stepped closer to his cell."And Fury said you're one of the master spy around. Either you're poor at doing your job, or I'm just really good at spinning my webs."Barton visibly swelled, his ego was consumed by anger."You might want to watch your back with this one. There's a chance he might break it."Tony saw Clint slamming his hands on the window of his cell."Yet I'm not the one working as a spy.""Hank Pym did say you never could really trust a Stark."Tony turned his head to the man."Who are you?""Come on, man."He shrugged. "He's right, keep taking his words in face value."He may have acted nonchalant, but inside he was anything but. He focused on the cell containing the man he once loved."Tony --""Wilson."Said man visibly tensed.Ever since they got together, Tony never called him by his last name. Shit."Tony --""Like I said, warmer than jail. How do you like it here?""I'm sorry --"Tony shook his head."No, you're not. You just want to coax me into letting you out.""That's not --"Tony shook his head again."So that's how much I worth to you, huh?""Tony, you're being --"Said man cut him off before he even finished."Was it because he's Captain America and you trust him more? Or was it because Romanoff is more satisfying than me? Hmm, what about because you're completely okay with Rogers because he's the paradigm of good, but when it comes to me you're suddenly homophobic?""What are you talking about? Tony --"He felt his anger rising to the surface."I'm talking about us! Was it always like this? You both are so willing to listen to what Rogers or any one of you had to say, but when it comes to me you ignored me. Was it just me you're doing that to?""No, Tony, we weren't ignoring you, we --""Careful, Sam. He's trying to guilt trip you," Barton warned.Tony scoffed. "Because I'm the one who always screw up in everything I do, including our relationship, right? Answer me Wilson, am I right?"He gritted his teeth."Yes."Tony felt like he swallowed a bottle of acid.He felt more hurt.More anger."That's the reason. You picked him over me without listening to what I have to say because --""You always make bad decisions! The Accords, Ultron, Washington, Killian, New York, Vanko, that was all on you!""What?"He felt cold. How could he... ?"What, reality just slapped you in the face, rich boy?"Anger once more took control."Reality had always torn me to pieces since I was born," he snapped."Bullshit.""Oh, I wish I could've said the same. You think you're the only one who had an abusive past? You're not a special snowflake, Barton."Barton felt anger. And possibly scared.Tony never liked to use someone's bitter past against them, he himself had too much of it, even though it was mostly his fault.What Barton didn't realize is that he never used someone's dark past against the people he considered friends. This just shows how much he was hurt by the betrayal and stubborness of these pig-headed people he once, foolishly, if he might say so himself, trusted his life with.It took a huge hit from the majority of his so-called friends and lovers - ex, lovers, to see they never really appreciated him and always took him and what he gave to them for granted.They never really counted him as an Avenger.And that hurt the most."And you are?""I'm never special, not then, and certainly not now. I'm just your typical snobby rich boy who wiped my snot using $50 papers and was spoiled too much by my parents since I was a baby," Tony said.His mind involuntarily brought up memories of his past.In her cell, hidden in the corner, Wanda saw it.She saw a young, possibly 4 or 5 year old, boy with messy chestnut brown hair being kicked out of a room.It looked like an office.She saw the boy starting to cry, and she expected the father, who was standing in front of him, to kneel down
