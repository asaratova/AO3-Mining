Chapter 1:


Inside a dark room, several glass orbs rotated in a circle. A figure of an unknown gender, observed complete in shadow, observed the images of many heroes. From speedsters to archers to magic users to alien heroes to billionaires in fancy suits to living gods and everything in between, and the enemies they fought, the figure observed.“The distinction between good and evil has always intrigued me. What is truly good? What is truly evil? In our own story, we are judged to be the hero, but in another, we could be the greatest threat. Champions have existed throughout the annals of time throughout space and time.”The individual waved a hand and chess pieces on a board appeared in front of the powerful entity.“Champions have fallen, hard. What is their breaking point? And when they are truly down, can they rise up again? When all is lost, can they become one again.”The figure touched many of the orbs at once and they all glowed before they slammed together to create one huge orb which shined in the life. The orb grew until it rose up and manifested until it’s own planet.“Let the games begin.”Beauty, a red sun setting had been an anomaly, but Alex Danvers enjoyed it the times she got to experience it here on Argo. She sat outside, with a smile on her face, leaning back and relaxing. She took in the culture, the atmosphere, and just the plain beauty of Argo over the last couple of months.The last couple of years had been interesting. Being an agent of a government organization, the DEO, living to serve and protect the citizens of Earth, Alex never thought she would be in the position she was in. The middle of three children, Alex always struggled to find her place. Her older sister, Carol, had been the ace of everything she ever did and Alex wondered what she could do to stand above Carol. And Kara, she had been extraordinary as well.Alex’s life turned out for the better when she found and bonded with an alien symbiote. Stranded, lost, and without a purpose of its own, Alex thought she found the purpose. The symbiote allowed her to become stronger and also allowed her to help save the world from threats. With a little help from her lovers. Yes the number of beautiful women Alex had the confidence to lay with now, had been an extraordinary turn around from just a few years ago.“Beautiful, isn’t it?”She knew someone stood behind her, but Alex basked in the moment. Her younger sister, Kara, stood, dressed in the Kryptonian attire worn by a number of the people in Argo. Standing next to Kara, was Lena Luthor, Kara’s lover, and Alex’s as well. Then again, Kara and Alex also shared a special bond and shared many sexual moments with each other.Rounding up the group, Gwen Stacy, also known to the people on Earth as the Sensational Spider-Girl. After a genetically altered spider bit Gwen, she had these extraordinary powers. And Gwen was also one of Alex’s lovers as well.“It is,” Alex said. “I’m enjoying the stay, as much as I’m sure you are.”“It’s like a dream come true,” Kara said.“And, it’s interesting to learn from them up close,” Gwen said.“For sure, the people of Argo are interesting,” Lena said. “I know I’ve got some new ideas from my stay here. Just how feasible they are, it remains to be seen.”“If anyone can figure it out, you can,” Kara said with confidence. “Alex?”“Just thinking,” Alex said.“I’m doing that a lot lately too,” Kara said. “Guess, this trip has given us a lot to think about.”Oh, Alex would have to agree. The trip had given them a lot to think about. And unfortunately, Alex thought all good things would come to an end. Argo had been a piece of history, the last monument of the world of Krypton, a world full of advanced science. And then had been more than welcoming, although Kara being Alura’s daughter had managed to open up doors that might not be possible to offworlders in the past.Alex, Kara, Lena, and Gwen were not the only individuals who visited Argo. Clark Kent, Kara’s cousin, and also known to the world at large as Superman, and his wife, Lois Lane-Kent, stood at the edge of the village. Lois had been giddy at getting a first hand account of an alien world and happy for her husband, in the sense that he got to visit a piece of his home planet, and not learn about it through the archives.“So, did you enjoy your stay?” Kara asked.“Yes, although exactly how much can I write about it?” Lois asked.“Don’t give any details about where it is,” Kara said. “Other than that, you’re good. I know you can spell the Pultizer.”Lois just grinned. Was she that obvious with her intentions? Maybe just a little bit. Maybe just a little bit. Clark just wrapped his arm around her.“I enjoyed it,” Clark said. “But, our vacation time with Perry is about burned up. Although, I’m sure he’ll be over the moon about how we’ve gotten a first hand account. Invited by Supergirl and Superman to explore it.”“I’m sure he’ll be pleased,” Kara said.“And I’m glad to have finally met you, Kal-
