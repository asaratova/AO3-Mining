Chapter 1: electrify my brains (and make me go insane)
    




Chapter Text
 Peter watches as Thor, the God of Thunder, walks over to him, his muscles rippling along with the swish of his jacket.
“Hello, Young Stark!” The God says, a large grin lighting up his perfect and chiseled face. “How are you today?”
Peter swallows, feeling his cheeks heat up as he reaches out a trembling hand to shake Thor’s, his voice squeaking as he replies. “G-good, Mr. Thor God of Thunder sir!”
God, he cannot wait to tell Ned about this at school tomorrow.
