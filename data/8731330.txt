Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Sarah Rogers welcomed her Alpha son Steven Grant Rogers on July 4th, 1920 while the fireworks exploded on the rich side of town. From her first look at the small baby she’d given life to, she knew that his life would be a hard one.Weak and already sickly looking, Steven didn’t scream like the other babies she’d heard but quietly coughed as he struggled weakly to breathe. His skin was slightly blue, and he was pale, but Sarah loved him anyways.She gratefully took him from the midwife and cuddled him close to her chest. His weakly waving hands turned wrist up to face her, and she smiled at the smudges of black and gray on his wrists that would eventually become his Soul-Marks.She turned to the door when it opened to accept both her Soulmates, Joseph coming in first and carefully leading Marionette to a chair next to the bed. Both leaned in to kiss her cheek before turning to the baby in her arms.“He’s adorable,” Marionette whispered, one hand rested on her distended stomach as the other came up to brush against his cheek. The other Omega was just about eight months pregnant, and she seemed quite happy to wait for her own child to be born.Sarah smiled, twisting her head to look up at Joseph. She leaned into his touch when he rested a hand on the top of her head and petted his fingers through her hair.“Even if he does not make it long, we will love him all the same,” Joseph murmured, leaning down to kiss both baby and mother lightly. The Alpha was happy to have a son but worried all the same about how sick he looked already at not even an hour old.Silence settled over the group as the adults settled in to watch over the small Alpha.�vYears would pass, and Steven would grow up alongside his younger Omega sister Katherine Imogen Rogers who oddly enough was even more protective of her older brother than the boy was of her. Steven was still sickly and weak at times, and often Sarah worried for his survival during the winter, but he was a little miracle, always seeming to survive against all the odds stacked against him.An accident only months after Katherine was born had taken Joseph away from them, but Marionette and Sarah persevered; Sarah went back to work at the hospital, and Marionette started making and selling knitted garments at her sister’s store. They worked hard for what they had and savored every moment of time together.Steven had just turned eight years old when he met Alpha James Buchanan Barnes. The other boy – only a year older than Steven – had stepped in between Steven and several other neighborhood boys – several of whom were Betas, unfortunately – who were bullying him, telling them off with words that would have gotten Steven’s mouth washed out with soap by both his Mother and his Mima.Steven had gotten angry at first, but once he’d gone home and been cleaned up by his Mima and explained what had happened, he’d realized that the other boy had been a big help and that he shouldn’t have gotten so angry. With that in mind, he spent the next day wandering through the streets, wondering if he should apologize or not.His choice was taken from him when he quite literally ran into the other boy. With a yelp, Steven toppled over, his blond mop falling into blue eyes when his hat fell off.“Oof.” Steven gasped slightly, having to take a deep breath in alarm. “Sorry, sorry!”“Eh, it’s fine, ya punk,” The other boy murmured, leaning down to help him up. With an arm around the smaller boy’s waist, James hoisted him back up onto his feet before bending down to grab Steven’s hat, beating it down onto his other palm before putting it back onto Steven’s head.Steven tugged lightly at the cuffs of his shirt before he released them and spoke, “I’m very sorry about yesterday. I didn’t mean to get so angry.”“Ma told me that I should have been better about it,” The other boy replied, pulling his hat off to shake out brunet locks.A long stretch of silence spread between the two before Steven spoke again, “I’m Steve.”“James, but only my Ma calls me that. I prefer Bucky,”“Nice to meet you.”Another silence before James spoke, “Wanna go chase the alley cats?”Steven giggled before nodding and following after the older boy as he led them away.After that they were inseparable. Bucky seemed to follow Steven around like a duckling, happy to keep watch over the young boy while also thinking up ideas of things for them to do. Steven’s mothers were happy as he stopped getting into as many fights because no one wanted to mess with the boy who could swear like a sailor and fight like a bear, and Bucky’s parents were happy to see that his aggression and mischievousness had an outlet in protecting and entertaining the younger sickly boy.�v�Bucky’s tenth birthday, on March 10th, brought the reveal of the first letters of his Marks. On his left wrist, the first letter was an A, but the rest was still hidden behind squiggles of black and gray. His right wrist’s letter was an S, and the rest was protected by stra
