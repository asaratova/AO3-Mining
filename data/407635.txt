Chapter 1: because his parents were hippies or arseholes.
    




Chapter Text
Most people, when they break up, sort through their record collections, possibly chuck each other’s clothes onto the sidewalk, engage in soul-destroying coffee dates where they try to sort through the emotional debris, and then leave each other the fuck alone.Clint and Natasha were never very good at acting like normal people, though, which is why they run a cafe together.“Six espressos for table eight,” Peggy says, coming up to the counter. “I think they’re playing some form of caffeine Russian Roulette.”Clint momentarily thinks about how if Natasha was here she’d show them what Russian Roulette really entails, but all he does is smirk and remark: “I’m not cleaning up after them”.  He turns toward the coffee machine that many long hours of practice have made his bitch.Peggy laughs, picking up the tray of paninis that Steve just put out for her.  She’s a good waitress; she’s much nicer and more patient with people than either Clint or Natasha have ever been, and rakes in the tips because customers are charmed by her British accent.  She’s not a pushover – her sharp shutdowns of guys trying to hit on her are pretty impressive to watch – but she’s definitely less of a bitch about serving people than the rest of them.They’re lucky to have her, actually; her and Steve, a part-time struggling artist who rules their kitchen with puppy eyes and earnest lectures on correct seasoning.  Steve is sweet in ways that Clint had forgotten people could be until Peggy brought in her best friend to interview for their cook’s position, and he occasionally worries that prolonged exposure to himself and Nat is going to end up breaking Steve in some fundamental way, but so far he’s remained cheerful and far too nice and makes a mean cupcake.No, most ex-couples don’t open a cafe together with no experience at either cooking or running a business, but as Clint puts the tiny espresso cups onto a tray for Peggy, he honestly isn’t sure why.=“I’m going to start a book club,” Natasha announces, “I need your apartment.”It’s seven a.m. and Clint hasn’t had his coffee yet, but he’s pretty sure that even if he had that sentence wouldn’t make a whole lot of sense.  “Um,” he manages, “you have an apartment.  A nice one, actually.  I helped Steve put together the furniture.”Natasha rolls her eyes and puts a mug in front of him.  She’s always been better at mornings than he is.“Yeah, but there’s more space in yours.  And it’s above the cafe, so catering would be much easier.”Clint takes a gulp of coffee and decides to deal with the next problem: “do you even read books that other people are going to want to read?  Because you gave a lifetime ban to that woman who was trying to read a Nicholas Sparks novel in here.”Nat waves her hand dismissively. “That was at least half Peggy.”“Semantics,” Clint tells her, and decides to deal with the rest of this when he’s woken up a bit more.The windchimes over the door jingle – they’re kind of annoying, but Bruce sent them over from India so of course they were going to hang them – and Pepper Potts walks in, wearing eye-wateringly high heels and a smile far too perky for this time of the morning.“Tony’s been up all night,” she says on an eyeroll, “so I’m going to need about five coffees and as many bagels as you can fit in a takeout bag.”Pepper is Tony Stark’s personal assistant and is consequently basically responsible for keeping them open; Stark himself has never set foot in their cafe but he really likes their coffee and pretty much anything they bake so Pepper’s in all the time picking things up.  She’s the only customer they allow to have a tab because god knows, Stark Industries is good for it.Clint heads for the coffee machine, saying over his shoulder: “Pepper, Nat wants to hold a book club in my living room-”“Intends to hold a book club in your living room,” Natasha corrects in a murmur, attention turned to sorting out bagels for Tony Stark.“-does that strike you as kind of invasive and unfair?” Clint finishes.Pepper slides onto one of the stools they have at the counter while she waits, linking her fingers and resting her chin on them.  “Will you take away my tab if I use the word ‘codependant’ to describe you two?”Clint considers this, capping plastic lids onto two americanos before he moves to start steaming milk for lattes.  “You wouldn’t be the first,” he sighs.  But hey, Nat had never liked his therapist anyway and Clint’s pretty sure that not going into business with her would’ve been worse for his life than whatever this is.=Natasha’s printed out flyers for her book club and left them next to the till; Clint gets the feeling she’s planning something that she’s leaving him out of, but he hasn’t worked out what it is yet.  Either way, it had better not end with his apartment getting trashed; that’s happened enough over the years.It’s a slow afternoon; Peggy’s perched at the counter filling in a crossword and hummi
