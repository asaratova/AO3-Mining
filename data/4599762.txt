She gets her words when she’s five, matching curls around her wrists. They appear one right after the other, on her left arm first, then on the right, maybe ten minutes apart, maybe fifteen. Her babushka tells her that this means it’s most likely that her soulmates—her grandmother calls them friends of the soul, because Darcy’s, you know, five—are related. Quite probably, they are twins. The handwriting is different, but similar, like they learned from the same person. Will learn, her grandmother corrects her, because if Darcy is five, that means her soulmates have just been born, can’t even dream of picking up a pencil for months or years. Darcy calls them The Twins, capitalized always, though most people can’t pick that up just from her saying it aloud. When she gets older, she starts calling them her Twins, but that’s only silent, only ever in her head. My Twins, lacing around her wrists like bracelets or handcuffs or chains. Her mother calls them her manacles. Lorna has never had a soulmark, never wanted one, and is viciously, vocally proud of it. (“Ain’t no one got time for that shit,” she tells Darcy one night, when Darcy’s thirteen and Lorna catches her rubbing her right wrist with her thumb. “All of it. Waste of fucking time.”Lorna’s drunk at the time—it’s rare to find a time when Lorna’s not drunk—but it stings worse than Darcy wants to admit.)Darcy’s five, but she’s already learned to read, so she knows precisely why her grandmother gets that weird pinched look to her mouth when she sees Darcy’s marks. On her left wrist, the handwriting—a bit loopy, a bit cramped, but clear all the same—spells out, I am sorry, can we perhaps talk about this later? And on the right, in crooked, hasty script, reads, Maybe when no one is shooting at us.It sets the tone for a lot of her life, to be entirely honest....The first time Darcy gets involved in a firefight is not in New Mexico, but at Culver, when she accidentally comes across an entire fucking Army battalion crossing the quad like some kind of Panzer invasion from World War Two.She’s not supposed to be here. She’s really not supposed to be here. She fell asleep in her fucking reading tree, okay, and woke up when someone shot off a tank in her general direction. It’s a miracle she’s not on fire right now. She’s a freshman, for Christ’s sakes, this is not what she signed on for coming into Culver. What she signed on for was political science and maybe, just maybe, a summa cum laude ranking, not—not tanks and gigantic green roaring monsters that apparently can fling said tanks like they’re Tonka trucks.She stays in her tree. And after it’s over, and she’s done throwing up, and the Army’s hustled off to places unknown, she decides that yeah, maybe hoping she can get through life with a taser she bought for fifty bucks off of eBay isn’t exactly the most conducive way to keep herself alive....Culver might not offer a class in firearms, but it’s Georgia. There are more people here with guns than she ever really realized, and she grew up in a neighborhood peppered with Confederate flags. It’s not too hard to find a shooting range, and after about six months of scrupulous savings, she buys her own gun. It’s nothing huge, the same kind of semiautomatic that policemen carry (she’s done her research, talked with women she knows in the criminal justice department, figured what she can afford to spend and based that around carry convenience and clip size and recoil and whatever else she’s listed out in her Need To Know notebook) (Darcy makes a lot of lists) but it’s hers, and this is her gun, and by god, she’s going to know how to use it.She makes friends with some of the other women at the range, not just because they’re women in a building that’s stereotypically crawling with beefy dudes with ego issues, but also because they’re kind of super awesome. Carol’s an Air Force pilot stationed at one of the bases near here, likes to practice with civilians when she can. “Get a different kind of air in my lungs, y’know,” she says, as she minutely adjusts Darcy’s grip and then judges her satisfactory. “Plus people don’t call me Captain out here.”“Nah, just Cap,” Darcy says, and ignores the look Carol gives her. Then Carol—because it’s Carol—snaps her headset over her ears, and lands four shots in center mass, just to prove a point.Val, on the other hand, is an enigma. She’s a grad student at Culver, focusing primarily in international political economies (or so she says; Darcy never really sees her around campus, so she’s not actually sure). She’s the sort of person who changes her ethnicity by the day—when Darcy first meets her, she says her father’s Italian, then she mentions her Iraqi grandmother, and then her Swedish cousin, and her South African aunt: the list goes on—but she’s steady, all barbed-wire and caramel, and she’s great to go drinking with. Darcy’s only been legal for a grand total of five minutes before she gets Val blowing up her phone about clubbing
