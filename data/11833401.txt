Prologue-- Several Weeks Ago

********************

 “Anthony.” Thor reached for Tony's hand and held it tight, joining Loki on the lawn of the Avengers compound. “Are you ready to leave with me then? To go to Asgard with me?” 
 Tony looked at the team gathered in front of the doors, rubbed uncomfortably at his chest and the reminder of  Siberia  that he was always going to have.“Yes.” Tony said firmly. “I'm ready to leave with you. I'm ready for--for Asgard.”  “  Are  you?” Loki asked, and his hand pressed just lightly at the small of Tony's back, then slipped underneath his shirt to touch his skin. Loki’s hand was ice cold, then suddenly burning hot and Tony shuddered a little, staring up at the Trickster God, who was looking down at him with something unreadable in his green eyes. 
 “Ye-yes.” Tony stammered, then glanced up at Thor who was watching them both with a curious, but pleased, expression. 

 “My brother and I have shared many things, all the centuries we have been together.” Thor said then, and ran his fingers lightly over Tony's skin, smiling when the sparks jumped between their bodies. “Perhaps you will enjoy Asgard more than you think.” 

 “Indeed.” Loki's skin seemed to ripple blue, but it was gone before Tony could be sure. “Some legends, say that the Trickster God and the Thunder God share a heartbeat, and even though we are not truly family, we will share two pieces of the same soul, we will share the same heartbeat.” 

 “Oh.” Tony squeaked when Loki pressed lightly against his back again, the touch first blindingly cold and then hot. 
 “Summon the bifrost.” Loki commanded with another curious smile down at Tony. “Lets us take your  hjartslattur  home.” 
 Thor grinned, raising Mjolnir high, and with a roar of thunder and flash of light, they were gone.

Chapter One
***************“Anthony,  Elskan Min , what are you doing out of bed?” Thor came around a corner and swooped Tony right off the floor and into his arms, cradling him close to his chest.“For the love of god---” Tony started to protest and Thor shushed him with a quick kiss.“I have told you, my love, if you are going to call for a deity then call for me.”“For the love of  Thor !” Tony snapped and pushed against a completely immoveable chest. “I can walk! The healers released me two weeks ago!”“Incorrect.” Thor started heading back to their room, huge steps taking him through the halls of the castle quickly. “They healed you two weeks ago, and suggested you spend several weeks in bed. So far, you haven't spent a  single  day in bed.”“That's ridiculous. You and I spent the entire day the other day in bed.” Tony insisted and then looked away immediately when Thor grinned down at him.“Indeed we did. But unfortunately I am afraid that day did not count as resting either, so back to bed you must go.” Thor held Tony in one arm and opened the door to their huge room with his other hand, shutting it quickly behind and moving to lay Tony out on their bed.“There.” Smoothing a piece of Tony's hair from his forehead, Thor stared down at him, blue eyes soft and adoring. “Anthony, please.  Please let the healing run it's course. They had to do so much for you.”  Thor opened Tony's shirt enough to see his chest- his smooth, bare chest with no arc reactor and no scars, just perfect tanned skin and a strong, steady heartbeat beneath it- and spread his fingers to reach as much as he could. “My love, they had to work so hard to heal you, please don't jeopardize it by being impatient.” His voice was thick with emotion. “We have come so far, to lose you now would---”“Alright.” Tony interrupted, and brushed his fingers over Thor's cheeks, through the soft beard. “Alright, I'm sorry, you’re right. I enjoy being healed, I'm not going to do anything to jeopardize it. I'm just bored, alright? Bored. I just wanted to explore the castle a little.”“Soon enough, sweetheart.” Thor leaned over the bed and pressed a kiss to his lips. “Soon enough you will be well and I will show you everything. Just please. A little patience.”“Fine.” Tony nodded and wound his fingers through the long blond hair, tugging Thor down until their mouths met in for longer this time, tongues slipping together until Tony could feel the sparks running across his skin, the way the air seemed to charge as Thor responded to him.“ Elskan Min .” Thor rumbled and Tony shivered as the giant leaned further into him to deepen the kiss for a moment before sighing and trying to pull away. “I am needed elsewhere, I regret that I cannot stay and---”“Just a few minutes.” Tony coaxed and held his lover a little tighter. “Stay with me.”“I have duties that cannot go untended.” Thor whispered, and lay the gentlest kiss on Tony's forehead. “But tonight… we may continue this tonight. It has been more days than I would like since I have had you beneath me.”“More days than I would like too.” Tony grumbled and sat up on the pillows. “Go on then. I have books to read.
