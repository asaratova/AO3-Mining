Coulson surveys the situation in the conference room, then turns towards Director Fury. "You're kidding, aren't you?" he asks, with just a hint of panic behind his usual emotionless voice."I wish I was," Fury replies. "As you can see, it's imperative to find out what happened and bring them back to a semblance of normality. I shall leave you to it, I need to go and see if we're any closer to finding out who did this...""You mean you're leaving me alone do deal with this? I think not," Coulson says.Fury draws himself up. "Agent Coulson, that was a direct order," he begins, but Coulson interrupts him."Shit," Coulson swears."Agent, cursing will not get you out of this," Fury says.Coulson makes a face and rushes forward. "Banner just shat himself," he says, rolling his eyes behind his sunglasses. "Go find some diapers, director."Nobody's quite sure of what happened. Then again S.H.I.E.L.D. is in even more disarray than usual, since most of its personnel has been hit by whatever that ray was. A de-aging ray, a teenage guy in a white labcoat informs him. Except that what he says is more along the lines of, "It's, like, something that takes away years from people's age! It's totally cool, dude!"Fury is tempted to yell at him because his jabbering is giving him a headache, but he can't because Banner is finally asleep and they can't risk to wake him up because he might throw a tantrum.The Avengers got the worst of the de-aging, and they've all shrunk back to toddlers. Stark is the oldest one of the bunch, and he doesn't look older than four. It would be easier to hire a couple of nannies to look after them while the few adults left try to figure out what happened, but it turns out that regular nannies won't work with children that can lift them bodily. Fury glares at baby Rogers and baby Thor, currently napping under the conference table."Good job, agent," he tells Coulson. "All those episodes of Supernanny are finally coming in handy.""Thank you, sir," Coulson says, picking up Stark before he can try to disassemble one of the chairs and confiscating his screwdriver.Later, Fury manages to get away under the pretense that he's looking for Miss Potts who might be able to deal with the kids, because if he has to change another diaper he'll go crazy.There's a bit of a crisis when they find out that Parker, being the youngest of the bunch, has turned into a newborn. Nobody noticed until he accidentally shot some spiderwebs and got himself stuck to the ceiling. While everyone is busy trying to get him down, Barton escapes from Coulson's care and disappears.Fury is less than pleased with this new development."Agent Coulson," he whispers, still trying not to wake up Banner who managed to sleep through all of the alarms. "I was counting on you to keep an eye on them! Now Barton could be anywhere!""It would have been easier if you didn't wander off, leaving me alone to deal with everyone," Coulson replies, voice equally low, pacing up and down with Parker in his arms."I was trying to locate Miss Potts," Fury bristles.Coulson snorts. "For the last five hours? I know you were hiding in your office reading the paper while I did all of the real work. Did you at least find her?"Fury points to a little girl with pigtails, hiding behind his legs. "Yes," he says.Coulson swears again.They find Barton in a crawlspace on the third floor, and Coulson lures him out using a set of toy bow and arrows. Barton's aim is still eerily accurate, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents quickly learn to duck whenever they pass by the conference room, to avoid being hit by rubber-tipped ammo.The toy set also contained a cowboy hat, which somehow becomes Stark's property. It's too big for him and falls over his eyes, but Tony doesn't seem to mind the fact that he's running around without seeing where he's going. In fact, Coulson thinks all Stark does is running around without seeing where he's going, so it's all right.When Rogers gets his pudgy hands on the sheriff's plastic star and tries to eat it, Coulson decides that it's time to find them some food.The cafeteria is overrun by preteens who think that cafeteria food is gross, so Coulson browbeats Fury until the director puts on an apron and ventures into the kitchen. He reemerges twenty minutes later, carrying a tray full of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a bag of baby bottles. Coulson sends him back because the baby bottles aren't warm enough, and tells him to check the milk temperature on his wrist."I knew that," Fury mutters, and then he goes looking for someone over the age of fifteen who can tell him what Coulson meant.Feeding a bunch of tiny Avengers is a lot like feeding a bunch of adult Avengers, Coulson thinks, except without the risk that they'll get drunk afterwards and wreck the place. When Fury returns with the warm milk, Coulson feeds baby Parker and makes him burp. Thor finishes his milk in record time and tosses his baby bottle on the floor, threatening to cry unless he gets mor
