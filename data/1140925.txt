Chapter 1





Chapter Text
No one was allowed into Tony's Workshop. Well, except Jarvis and Pepper, but no one really counted them when it came to Tony letting people do things. Rhodey and Happy could get in sometimes too, but that was it.Bruce let them in his lab, for all he made it obvious when he didn't want them there. He was more relaxed in the space Tony had given him, at peace with himself.Clint let them into the archery range, except when he was at his worst and using the space to cool off. Tony stocked it with the best archery toys money couldn't buy, one of the only people he would design weapons for still.Natasha let them into her ballet studio, which had been fitted with fingerprint-locked sliding mirrors hiding dozens of dozens of weapons from Tony. She always watched them, carefully, and rarely danced for them, but Bruce joined her in meditating and the others talked with her a little.Steve let them into his art studio. He hid some of his drawings and rarely accepted praise, but he still let them in, even asking them to help with some of the more advanced art technology Tony had made sure to stock alongside the traditional art supplies and art history books in the room.Thor was so open he may as well have been shouting an invitation into his space to the world. Tony brought Jane to stay, and she set a bit of a boundary line where their bedroom was concerned, but not a hard line, more like one in the sand; easy to step over, just there as a reminder that sometimes they needed privacy.Coulson let them into his office, which was almost like a sacred privilege by the way the junior agents phrased it. Tony eventually bought the man a comfortable couch because the Avengers were in and out so often.But no one was allowed into Tony's Workshop. Oh he had others, labs and shops where he'd take a tricky design or a fun one to work with Bruce on, ones they could talk to him in, but it was extremely clear from the very beginning that no one, no one, except Tony, Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, and Jarvis were allowed in his inner sanctum, and occasionally not even them. He'd hide away there for days and emerge with a new com unit, three possible fabrics for body armor for Natasha and Steve to test, and a new arrow design for Clint before collapsing in his stark bedroom. After a bad fight, he went to The Workshop, rather than to his room or the common area with the others.Steve had mentioned it once in curiousity, wondering if it was a trust issue and offering to try and fix it. Tony had smirked a little, but his eyes were wary and hard, unwilling to negotiate."Nah, Cap, trust is a pretty fluid concept for me," he had replied, "I just like my space."All of them got the gist of not wanting to pry and left it alone after that, and for over a year Tony spent more time in the workshop than out of it.
