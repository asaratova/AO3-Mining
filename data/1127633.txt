Chapter 1: Happy Thorsday
    




Chapter Text
Thor was handed a cupcake, in it was a lit candle and Steve was smiling, grinning almost, by having made a personal gesture like this.  “Happy Thorsday!” Thor smiled and crushed Steve in a grateful hug. “Blow the candle out, make a wish.  That’s traditional for Thorsday? Right?”Thor’s personal tradition involved drinking, eating, fighting and getting naked with his person of choice, not necessarily for sex, but if Steve wanted to, Thor wasn’t going to object. Thor blew out the candle.  “What did you wish for?” asked Steve. Thor grinned from ear to ear.  “Join me and find out?”
