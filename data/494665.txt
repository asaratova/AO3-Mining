Steve walked into the gathering room at the tower to find all five of his teammates sitting on the sofas staring at laptops.  “What’s going on?” he asked.“Thor’s in love with his brother, Hulk becomes a psychoanalyst and wears a tweed jacket and asks people how they feel about their mothers, and you and I are fucking,” Tony said casually, not even looking up from the screen. “I doubt it, I really doubt it, and no, we are definitely not,” Steve answered.“I took your virginity on a lab table,” Tony answered. “Apparently, it hurt but you liked it.  So, you know, sorry and you’re welcome.”“My vir-  wait, what?”“Dude.  People are writing stories about us,” Clint explained. “This is seriously the most awesomely hilarious thing I have ever seen.”“Stories?” Steve said.Bruce explained, “It’s fanfiction. It’s when people write stories about people they don’t know. Famous people, or fictional characters.”“Like those Captain America comics they used to do…” Steve said with a sigh.  All that fuss still made him uncomfortable. “Really? I didn’t know those comics had porn in them,” Clint smirked, “I’ll have to buy some.  Or hell, Coulson probably has them, I’ll just steal his.”“Since he is your boyfriend, after all,” Natasha said with a laugh, teasing him for being part of such an angsty pairing.“What? No he's not, why would you -- please tell me this is one of those 21st Century things that I can get away with not understanding,” Steve said. “Nope,” Tony said. “No way are you not reading some of these,” and he pulled Steve down next to him and turned the screen so they could both see.“Um.  They’re writing stories about … us?” Steve asked Tony, “Together?”“Dude, we’re like the most popular pairing,” Tony said and tried to get Steve to give him a high five.  Steve didn’t. “But… why?” Steve asked again.  “And… wait, you were serious? This person thinks I’m a virgin?”“Everyone thinks you’re a virgin,” Natasha explained. “But – I was a soldier.  In World War II.  On tour, just me and dozens of USO girls.  I mean, USO women.  And then there were all of the French prostitutes. I mean, the French sex workers. And the Captain America groupies back then.  Plus all the ones now.  Plus, Zoe from accounting.  Plus —““We get it, Captain STD, but everyone on the Internet writes about you being a virgin. Until I come along, of course,” Tony said with a grin, earning him an eyeroll.“We did have contraceptives in the 40s, you know,” Steve grumbled at the STD comment. “But why would anyone write these things?”“It’s fun once you get into it,” Bruce said. “Actually, when I was younger, there was this show called Highlander that I really liked and I would read and write stories about them for a fanzine. I mean a magazine.”“Were they dirty, filthy stories, I hope?” Clint said with a grin.“What do you think?” Bruce said, smiling back lasciviously.Tony added, “I’m so glad you said that, Banner. I wasn’t going to say anything but I used to be totally into Star Trek. TNG all the way, baby.  Though of course I had mixed feelings about the Data storylines.  But anyway, I was totally a BNF if I do say so myself.  That’s Big Name Fan,” he added for Steve who rolled his eyes yet again.“Tasha once pretended to be a mail order bride just to lure someone into a SHELD facility,” Clint said with a smile. “Does that count as fanfiction?” “No,” Bruce said, just as Tony said, “Yes.”“Hey, I haven’t found any of Bruce and Clint together,” Natasha noted.“There are a few but not many,” Clint said.“Wait, nobody writes about the two who are actually a couple?” Steve said, confused.“They’re too busy reading about the only two straight dudes on the team 69ing on the battlefield,” Clint said with a snort, nodding at Steve and Tony.“But that’s – so impractical. And also, just – I would never – I mean, no offense Tony but--”Tony answered cheerfully,“None taken. By the way, I’m usually the bottom.  Some people would be insulted by that, but I’m pretty sure that means I’m the favorite.” They all continued reading.“We all seem to cry a lot,” Bruce observed. “Except Natasha,” Clint noticed, “Tasha, you don’t even smile in most of these.”“That’s okay.  I’m beating the crap out of you guys and you guys are begging for more, so that’s cool,” she said with a shrug.Steve stared for a moment and wanted very much to ask if she was serious about liking that image, because –His thoughts (which probably would have gotten his ass kicked in the not-fun way, to be fair) were interrupted when Tony elbowed him and said, “Look this one is labeled ‘Science Boyfriends’ so it’s about me and Bruce.  ‘Superhusbands’ is about me and you. ‘Stark Spangled Banner’ is about the three of us – clever, right?”“Ugh. ‘Clintasha.’ I hate it,” Natasha said.“Hey,” Clint said, irrationally insulted.“The name, I mean.  ‘Bartomanov’ would be better,” she said. “You are very wrong on that,” Bruce said, and everyone agreed.“If this were a fanfic, I would totally be allowed to shoot you all for disagreei
