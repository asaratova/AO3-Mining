"No one's making me do anything," Darcy is arguing while Jane has a mini tantrum. Jane's tantrums are always fascinating to watch. She doesn't like messing up workspaces so she'll toss a piece of paper or knock over an empty coffee cup.It's like a storm in a bottle.Right now Jane is flicking rubber bands at the Avengers poster Darcy has tacked up in her cubicle. She's always had a team spirit, feels like she's being supportive if she owns merchandise. Jane carefully targets each member, except Thor. Darcy's certain it's because Jane thinks Thor would know, would be disappointed that Jane had sullied his visage or something.Darcy just can't believe she works around people that have a poster. It's all still more than a little startling.She also can't believe someone gave Jane a rubber band gun, these people are obviously crazy."You're just reciting what the Man told you," Jane accuses, aiming for and hitting Iron Man's crotch."There's no Man," Darcy says, knowing that Jane's going to have to wind herself down, can't actually be reasoned with in this state. She'll make the effort, but it's usually like trying to get a grip in an ice shelf. Darcy spins herself lazily in her desk chair, only stops when Jane hits her on the forehead with one of the rubber bands. "Look, most of the time your work is exciting and amazing but then there's...""There's...?" Jane prompts, aiming the rubber band gun menacingly."There's the times when stuff is... compiling? When we just have to sit and watch it all compile.""That's exciting too," Jane says, lowering the gun and pouting."For you, yes. You can see the code," Darcy says, waggling her hands around. When Jane just gives her a blank look she sighs. "The Matrix? No? Wow.""You're mine though," Jane says, still not sounding convinced."That's oddly possessive of you," Darcy says with a grin. "I've already told Coulson that you're my priority. I drop everything else when you need me.""I'm your priority?""Of course you are," Darcy says, leaning over so she can pat Jane on the shoulder and disarm her in one smooth motion. "But all the other times there's other stuff I can do, I feel like I'm contributing.""You like being a general gopher, gal Friday, errand girl?" Jane says, dubious."Just one of those terms would have been sufficient enough to properly express your disdain.""No, it's... if you're happy, that's what I want for you. I just don't want anyone taking advantage of you.""I promise mom, I won't do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable," Darcy says with a little salute.

Darcy likes having a desk of her own, was touched when Agent Coulson had gone to the trouble of setting her up near his own offices. The labs are fine, impressive actually, but everything is covered in Jane's work. Darcy had initially tried to carve out a little space for herself but it had soon been re-absorbed by papers, charts and equipment.It also helps to have somewhere to escape to when Thor visits.

Darcy first runs into Captain America when she's got an armload of folders. She's not looking where she's going, he tries to sidestep her and she catches the movement out of the corner of her eye and manages to move in the wrong direction. Captain America, Steve he insists with a wry tilt of his mouth, helps her pick everything up amongst apologies even though it wasn't his fault at all.He insists on carrying the folders for her, gets a pinched look to his face when he claims he has nothing else to do, anyway. Darcy lets him trail her, feeling self-conscious because it's Captain America carrying her paperwork but unable to find a polite way to wrestle it back from him.Steve hovers when he carefully puts the folders down and Darcy eyes him. "Did you need something?" she asks, careful to make her tone kind rather than dismissive."I just..." Steve starts, kind of shrugs and says, "No, it's... I'm fine, thanks."He turns and Darcy doesn't know why she does it, but she snags his elbow, tugs so he swivels back to face her. "Have you eaten lunch yet?" she asks.Steve gives her a grateful smile, shakes his head and Darcy grabs her bag.

Turns out she's not the only one awed and a little frightened by Steve. He's a sweet guy once you get to know him, but it's the getting to know him part that proves tricky for most people. "Everyone avoids me," he laments into his chocolate milkshake."You're a national icon," Darcy says, sympathetic. "It's kinda hard to walk up to you and say, dude, what's up, y'know?""You did," Steve points out, giving her the toothpaste smile that she's seen him dazzle people into submission with."Hey, once you've hung out with a demigod, everything else is cake," Darcy says with an imperious lift of her eyebrow and Steve chuckles.

Steve's not supposed to leave SHIELD headquarter without being accompanied by an agent, but Darcy thinks she qualifies and argues with Coulson until he agrees. "He's climbing the walls," she says. "I mean literally. He saw a parkour video on youtube
