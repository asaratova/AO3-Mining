Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Chapter 1AN: So, I was writing my Peggy/Howard story (which I will continue to update/write) when I ended up being reminded of my love of Ironwidow, and then I debated how I would write the idea I have, and this is the result. Hope you like. Let me know what you think.The summary basically explains how this is going to work. There will be changes to the MCU, but things will be very similar in a lot of ways up until the airport battle in CACW where things will become very different.

When you've been a spy as long as Natasha Romanoff you become okay with doing a lot of things. Things that are just written off as 'doing your job', but after being undercover at Stark Industries, spying on Tony Stark, Natasha feels the need to talk to him, to clear the air. She feels this need not because she feels bad about what she did, because she doesn't, but because she has realized that she saw him when he was vulnerable, she saw past his mask; and as someone who has spent her life with a mask up she knows how much of a big deal that is.Feeling surprised that JARVIS hasn't just blocked her from all access, Natasha has made her way through Tony's, still slightly destroyed, Malibu house, and down to his home workshop. Walking into the room Natasha is, though she doesn't let it show, surprised, to find Tony working with a little brown-haired boy, who looks to be no older than about nine."Give me a minute Romanoff," Tony says, an edge which Natasha can detect to his voice, and she assumes JARVIS warned him, without looking away from what he is doing "Just connect that piece there, to that piece there," Tony says as he points out what to do to the boy."Like this Dad?" The boy asks, as he does what his father told him, and Natasha has to fight not to react to that because it was certainly not something she was expecting."Exactly like that, Pete," Tony says as he ruffles his hair. "Now, we've got a new circuit board for my Repulsor," Tony explains."Awesome," Peter says, with a grin."Peter, I have to talk to Natasha, do you want to go up to the kitchen and get a snack?" Tony asks his son curious."You're going to have boring adult talk?" Peter asks, looking between his Dad and Natasha."Yep," Tony confirms."Okay," Peter says, putting what he is working on down. "I'll ask JARVIS to tell me when I can come back," Peter explains."Good idea," Tony says, and once he does Peter jumps down from the stall he is standing on and heads out of the garage, pausing at Natasha."Hi," Peter greats with a grin."Hi," Natasha says, honestly not sure what else to say, as Peter walks past her, and out of the room."Look at you, finding out all my secrets," Tony says, a bitter edge to his voice, as he turns to look at Natasha."I wasn't expecting my clearance to still work," Natasha admits, as she walks a couple of steps closer to Tony, completely side stepping his comment."Hadn't got around to deleting it," Tony says, honestly it completely slipped his mind. "What do you want Rushman… I mean Romanoff?" Tony asks, having clearly called her the wrong name of purpose."To talk," Natasha admits. "Look, I get it, you've spent your life being exactly what people expect you to be, not expecting anyone to see through the persona…" Natasha starts to say."That's because they never do, not unless I want them too," Tony says, knowing that for some reason that doesn't include Natasha, and that both terrifies and intrigues him."Which isn't a whole lot of people I'm guessing," Natasha admits."Do you have a point Natasha or are you just repeating what we both know?" Tony asks, feeling rather uncomfortable about the conversation."My point is, I know that that it can be uncomfortable when you slip and someone sees through the cracks, sees the parts you hide, and I want you to know that I have no intention of revealing what I saw," Natasha admits, doing what she would like someone to do for her if the roles were reversed."I kind of figured that when I read your report," Tony admits. "Thanks for that by the way," Tony says, and Natasha just gives a simple nod. "You know I saw through a crack too," Tony says, and Natasha tenses. "You may be a triple impostor, but you're a triple impostor who cares. You were fascinated by me and Rhodey because you clearly still trying to figure out what friendship, what having people to count on, means, but don't worry, I'm not going to tell anyone that the Big Bad Black Widow has a heart," Tony comments, having learnt what her code name is."Appreciate it," Natasha admits, feeling pretty uncomfortable, and in that moment, that moment of frightening honestly for them it is like something shifts between them, something changes."And I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about Peter," Tony says, his voice turning even more serious."I did research, deep research, I found nothing that said you have a son," Natasha admits, honestly a little impressed that Tony managed to keep that fact a secret conside
