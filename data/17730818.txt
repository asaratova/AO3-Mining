Chapter 1: In Which Tim Drake Is Chased By the Mini Justice League (Because Dimension Traveling sucks, That's Why)
    




Chapter Text
Tim Drake, also known as Red Robin, hates dimension hopping. First it's getting hit with the holy shit everything hurts feeling, then it's trying to actually figure out where you are. It always goes downhill from there without a fail, like right now, how he was currently being chased by who he could only assume to be this world's heroes, heroes that were definitely not the Justice League or the Titans. Tim tried to be friendly, he really did, but he was admittedly kind of snappy after realizing that Ra's al Ghul somehow got his hands on an interdimensional travel device and zapped him here. And hey, if he called that flying robot dude a metal shit bucket, well he blamed sleep deprivation on that, along with dealing with a thousand year old immortal who wanted his children.Too bad he was still being chased over the goddamned rooftops.     Like seriously, the rooftops were supposed to be his playground, not this mini Justice League's. Speaking of which, he was going to have to do some research so he would know how to counter all of them,Especially the dude who was chasing Red right now, the dude actually keeping up with the vigilante, and even gaining on him as he dashed from one roof to the next. The guy looked like someone barfed America all over him, and any other time he would have laughed and the ridiculous red white and blue outfit the man was sporting, but he couldn't when he was in danger of being caught any second. It didn't help that he also had a shield made out of this weird metal on his arm, and whenever he got close to Red he threw it.Like right now, the vigilante could hear the cutting sound of the shield ripping through the air, right at Red. Acting on pure instinct alone, Red jumped over a ventilation unit, diving behind it just as the shield brushed the top of his cowl. Not having time to ponder how he was nearly decapitated by the equivalent of Propaganda Man, the vigilante slipped out a few smoke pellets from his gauntlets, throwing them in the man's path to give himself cover. He then ran left instead of straight, thinking that unless Propaganda Man was also secretly Super Jump Man that he wouldn't be able to jump 30 feet straight into the air to follow him.Red whipped out his grappling hook, the gadget shooting into the air nearly silently, catching on his desired destination. It began pulling him up, and from behind him, Red could hear Propaganda Man call out, "Tony, he's going west!"The vigilante cursed as he landed on the rooftop, his ankle giving off an aching pain. He injured it before he dimension hopped when he was fighting Ra's', thinking he could just pull through it, but it was proving to more than he could ignore. And to make things better, he realized that there were no building high or close enough for him to find refuge in, leaving him trapped on a rooftop as he heard the faint but familiar whirling of machinery come his way. He didn't know this city like he knew Gotham or even Bludhaven, meaning he basically trapped himself in an unfamiliar place surrounded by people he knew nothing about. Just fantastic. And then there was the whole thing with how his head was still slightly fuzzy from the dimension traveling, so he wasn't as sharp as he should be.   Oh, and did he mention he noticed the Green Arrow rip off in a distant building, no undoubtedly blocking all potentially safe exits? Yeah, that really sucked as well. This entire situation sucked some major ass.Fuck. When he got out of this mess, he was going to destroy one or two of Ra's' Pits, just to show him how uncool all of this is. That is, if he could even get back to his own damn universe.       "Shit.""I do believe shit is the right word," said a cocky sounding voice, an aftertone that was metallic and robotic mixing in with it. Red slowly turned around, making sure to keep the arrow dude in his peripherals as he faced the metal shit bucket man from before. His helmet was gone now, making the vigilante wonder if he even cared that there could be someone with a camera right now that could take his picture and post it everywhere. Breaking News: Hero is and idiot and exposes his secret identity to everyone, morons clap and rejoice! And seriously, that dude had a goatee and and damn beard! Like, who even tried to pull that off anymore? (Green Arrow immediately pops into his mind, but Ollie looked damn good with a goatee, so he couldn't be counted.)"You gave us a good run, kid," the metal man continued, raising his right hand, where Red could see a glowing circle in the center of his palm. "Now, you're going to come with us quietly, or we'll be forced to use less friendly methods."The vigilante contemplated this, eyes darting from the metal man to the arrow man from behind the white outs of his cowl. It was moments like this he wished that he had his team with him, or at the very least K
