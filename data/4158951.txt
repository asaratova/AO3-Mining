It takes a very confusing few minutes to even figure out who he... is. Ish. He finds the badge and has a nice, isolated bout of panic about that, and then stares at it for a good long while, willing his brain (his brain? how is this happening, this can't–) to make sense of the letters: MAHONEY.Matt knows the basic shapes of written letters, but not – not, in anything approaching recent memory, with his eyes (his eyes? what–), and tracing them with his fingers helps bring it back a bit.Mahoney.So.“What the fuck,” he whispers, and then jumps about a foot in the air because he recognizes the voice. Should have started there.So. He's Brett.He can't hear anything.Correction:He can hear Bess Mahoney, coming up the stairs. “Brett!” she calls, and then knocks on the door, and Matt dives back into the bed. “Aren't you up? You're gonna be late!”“I – I think I'm sick!” Matt calls back, and the hoarseness in his voice is entirely due to terror, but if it will help sell his story he'll take what he can get.“Sick?” Bess nudges the door open and steps inside. Matt closes his eyes and when he opens them again she's standing over him. She looks –She looks –Matt doesn't know how she looks. He's casting back twenty years, trying to remember how other people's faces move when they're thinking or feeling certain things.She sounds concerned. “What kind of sick?” She lays a hand on his forehead.“Don't know yet,” Matt groans. “Might be food poisoning,” he adds, and he – he shouldn't have said that, it was at the top of his list because last night he felt like he'd eaten something off (even though he was sure he hadn't, and - and, wait, wait, did he pass out?), but for all he knows, Brett Mahoney's last meal was something Bess cooked.She clicks her tongue and straightens up. “So you weren't just blowing smoke last night.”...Or, his last meal and Brett Mahoney's last meal was something with actually impossible properties that might have switched their bodies, okay, sure, he can work with that theory.He forces himself to laugh. Throws himself into the role. Nothing else for it. “Nah, that's your job. I keep telling Foggy to quit buying those things.” Brett – Brett does call him Foggy, right? He doesn't call him Nelson, does he? Shit. He can't remember. Maybe he calls him both.Bess smacks his arm. “Oh, let an old woman have her fun.”“If I see any, I will.”“Good answer.” Bess chuckles, pats him on the shoulder and turns to leave. “Today's my day out with the girls, you want me call it off, keep you company? We could watch a movie.”“No, no, you go ahead,” Matt says, hope and panic flaring as one. “I'll be okay. I might... I might take a walk later, clear my head. If I'm not home when you get back.” He's trying, now, to remember why Bess lives with Brett, vaguely remembers Brett mentioning once or twice that he'd like to move her someplace warm, and he really hopes there's not some absolutely vital healthcare-related daily thing that he's going to have no idea how to do. Hey, Mom, brought a friend over, I just thought it might be a nice change of pace if Matt Murdock helped you out with your medications tonight.“Feel better, baby.” She's walking away and Matt is getting dizzy, witnessing the shifting perspectives of continuous motion like this for the first time since – since there'd been a truck, coming at him, very fast. Bad thought, bad thought. Abort.“Don't throw any wild parties!” Bess adds over her shoulder, laughs, and shuts the door behind her.Matt sits up, slowly, and finally acknowledges his current relative calm for what it really is: shock. It's a window that's rapidly closing, and he needs to be utilizing it. It is in fact a miracle that that interaction didn't end in disaster.So. So – phone. Yes. He should – he should call in sick. He should definitely call in sick, because he's pretty sure Brett would rather lose a sick day (or however many days this might take) than deal with any... ramifications that might arise, should Matt attempt to do his job.Matt shuts his eyes, confused and irritated by the lack of a headache, which he is pretty sure he should have for about five hundred different reasons. Hopes Brett is the type who sleeps with a phone, feels around the bed for it.Phones have – changed, somewhat, since the last time Matt saw one. This feels like a phone. And looks... like how he's heard phones described, probably. He thinks. It's all very...He can see.He's wearing cotton sweatpants, lying on cotton sheets and they feel fine, traffic outside is muted and the only voices he gets are muffled shouts, his sense of smell is about on par with a bad head cold, he can't – he can't taste anything, in the air, it's just – it's just air, and he can see.And Brett's phone is locked.Brett's phone is locked and Matt doesn't even know who he would be calling with it if it wasn't. He doesn't know who Brett calls when he calls in sick and the phone is locked and he can fucking see.Matt buries his head under the pillow and
