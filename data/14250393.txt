Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Maria’s labor lasts for thirty-six horrific hours.Even with the epidural, even with the finest of care, it’s still a study in agony.Agony that, in the end, amounts to  nothing.Her and Howard’s son is born blue in the face, cord wrapped around his neck, and tiny chest  still.Stillborn the doctors mutter even as they massage his chest, even as they try to save him, hopeless as they all know it is.Maria stares at the ceiling of the delivery room and cries, a slow and silent trickle of tears.In the background she can hear Howard cursing and screaming at the doctors and nurses.  There’s the sound of a chair being thrown and then she hears the low, placating tones of Obadiah.But then … a tiny, faltering cry.“It’s a miracle,” the nurse tells Maria once she’s in recovery, once Howard has left and Anthony has been checked and double checked but found surprisingly whole.  “Your son is a miracle.”Maria wants to believe her, wants to feel the same way, she swears she does.But all Maria can feel is the gaping hole of  grief that had eaten away at her hours before when they’d pulled him, silent and still, from her body.The joy that should be there, the elation of having him in her arms after thinking he was gone, is just … not there.~~~In the days and years to come Maria will think back on that day, on those moments, and she’ll wonder.Was the love, the warm devotion, she knows she should have for Anthony snuffed out completely in those moments of aching, ash flavored grief?Or would she have always been so distant, so far removed from her  passerotto, her little sparrow of a son who flits here and there and died before he was ever born?Mostly though she’ll do her best not to think about it.To not think about  him.~~~Anthony Edward Stark is born silent and still with Death pressing Her cold, sharp kiss into the center of his soul.In some ways it changes  everything.In others ways … well some things are always meant to be.~~~Tony grows fast and hard.Grows like the doctor’s predictions of brain damage and developmental issues are a personal challenge.A thrown gauntlet he can’t bear to let go unanswered.An insult he’s determined to prove wrong with every inch of his being.He grows and grows and  grows.~~~The first time he hears the  whisper he’s three and there’s a dog, stick thin and ragged looking, lurking in the back garden of the mansion.Tony looks at the dog from where Jarvis had gently nudged him out onto the grass with a ball to “play young sir, as a child your age should”.Jarvis comes back outside a few moments later, a tea tray in his hands.“What are you staring at Master Anthony?”  Jarvis asks him gently, because Jarvis is always gentle.It’s what Tony  loves about him.“Dog,” Tony tells him simply as he raises a hand and points in the sick looking dog’s direction.“Ah,” Jarvis’ voice sounds pinched and when Tony looks up his lips are pursed.  “I’ll call Maxwell, he’ll catch the poor thing and see that it’s cared for.”“No,” Tony shakes his head even as he toes disinterestedly at the ball.  “It’s leaving soon.”“Really now,” Jarvis pats him softly on the head.  “What makes you say that?”“It’s going to die.” Tony tells him seriously as he tilts his head up to look Jarvis in the eye.“A-And how,” Jarvis clears his throat softly, “how do you know that?”“Just do,” Tony shrugs.  “Can we go inside now?”And that’s the truth too.  Tony knows the dog is dying, knows that it will go off into the woods and by this time tomorrow it’ll be dead, body cold and soul gone.He doesn’t know  how he knows that but there are a lot of things Tony doesn’t know how he knows.  All he knows is that there’s a small, soft whisper in the back of his mind that croons the knowledge to him.It’s just the way things have always been so, to him, it’s not that big of a deal.Tony isn’t sure, exactly, what the look on Jarvis’ face means when he nods and herds Tony back into the mansion but he isn’t particularly worried about it either.Jarvis isn’t going anywhere any time soon.Tony  knows that.~~~Tony is four the second time Death comes for him, the second time She presses Her lips against his brow and Her kiss into the center of his soul.He’s four and he’s building, building,  building.Four and sneaking in and out of Sir’s workshop for tools and materials.Four and clutching a circuit board in his hand.Four and his head is snapping back from the force of Howard’s blow.Tony doesn’t feel the corner of the table when he hits it, instead the world just goes black around him.~~~“You have started so early,” She whispers to him, skeletal hands tracing across the lines of his face.  “I knew you would. My little star, born already collapsing. You are going to be so  beautiful.”~~~He wakes up later, head aching and mouth dry.He can still feel the cold trails Her fingertips had left behind.Tony wonders when he’ll see Her again.Because it is a question of  when  and not  if.Tony  knows that.~~~When Jarvis sees the blood in the study he comes to T
