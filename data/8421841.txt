Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“We'll demand Helmut Zemo face the death penalty.” Tony Stark was exhausted. It was late into either the third or fourth day of working on the accords. Tony didn’t remember which. It could be a factor in why he hadn’t really understood a word of what came out of Ross’ mouth. He was trying to make the accords into something sustainable, something people could agree on, and damn it he didn’t need someone’s blood all over them. It was bad enough what this shit storm had done. Bad enough he lost his family, to quote Roger’s. The Avengers were scattered, in pieces, and half the world feared them. Now, to add insult to injury, the government wanted to make a bigger mess and spill more blood. Perfect, just perfect. It was exactly what he needed right now. “And what basis are you planning to petition that on exactly?” “His attack on the UN killed hundreds. People will demand justice.” “They want justice, not an easy way out. He’s not going to be judged on American soil. Even if he was, no jury would ever convict. He’s a Sentinel who lost his Guide in the most horrifying way. At best he’ll get sent to prison for the rest of his life, but chances are they’ll send him to a psych ward. You’ll never get what you want.” How Everret Ross could think Zemo would ever face the death penalty was beyond Tony. The man was a Sentinel himself, he should know better. He knew what happened in Sokovia. Zemo had lost everything. His country, his family, and in the end, his mind. “If you try this, I’ll make sure he gets judged by the Sentinel’s Council. They won’t like what you have planned one bit. If you aren’t careful, they might even force you to be evaluated.”  Tony was too tired to play nice. The dark circles around his usually expressive eyes were deep, deep enough to resemble the bruises Captain America and his side kick had left behind in Siberia. Tony has lost weight and his skin had paled considerably, but none of it took away from the strength and determination in his gaze. Tony knew what he did had been right and he was going to fight for it. It was the only way, Steve and the stick up his patriotic ass be damned. “You’re an unbonded Sentinel.” Tony continued. “They won’t be happy with that. They’ll think you can’t understand what happens when a bond is broken so traumatically, and they’d be right. They’ll want proof that you were as well a functioning Sentinel as you like to think. Don’t force my hand Everett. I already have one Ross on my shit list, you don’t want to make it two.” Tony was tired of playing by the rules. He had tried. He’d tried hard, harder than he knew possible, and in the end he had still lost everything. He was done playing everyone else’s game and he no longer cared if people agreed with him or not. A disdainful laugh filled the air, grating on Tony’s ears and interrupting his introspection. He wondered, just for a moment, how someone with such hyper sensitive hearing could make such a horrid noise. “You know Stark, you shouldn’t threaten your betters. You’re an unbonded Guide, or did you forget? Why should the council listen to anything you have to say on the matter?” The pen he had been using to edit the nonsense in front of him shattered in his hand, splattering black ink across the page like blood from a putrid wound. “You really don't know anything about the Councils, Everett. Don't force my hand, you won't like the result.” It was that moment that T’Challa came back from his break, and Tony had never been happier to see the young king. For once he didn’t care that this was the same man giving shelter to the Avengers and hiding Barnes. He was just relieved to see the man who had done so much work to help Tony make the accords into working documents. Rogers should have been the one at Tony’s side, bleeding over these documents. Rogers should have been the one exhausted, scouring over words so complicated an experienced lawyer wouldn’t know what to make of them. It should have been Rogers, Tony’s so called friend and team mate. It should have been Rogers and instead it was a practical stranger. It showed how far the Avengers had fallen that Tony trusted a man he’d known for only a few days more than his own team. Tony had trusted Steve, believed him to be a friend. It was clear he was wrong, and no matter how much Tony had tried, it hadn’t been enough. Roger’ hadn’t even looked back. He walked away without a second glance because it wasn’t possible for Tony to be right for once. After Ultron, Tony had never gained the Captain’s trust back. He just hadn’t realized it until it was too late. “Is everything okay here? Mr. Ross?” Everett Ross had the good grace to look ashamed. The man had developed a genuine admiration for the Wakandian king, and when faced with him, Ross didn’t have much to say. “I just came to tell Mr. Stark what will happen soon. I hope you'll be able to make him see that it's in everyone's best interest, your Majesty.” He bowed to the monarch before he
