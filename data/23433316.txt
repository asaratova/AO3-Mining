Notes:

Short summary of Keep Boredom at Bay (warning: spoilers if you're planning on reading it at some point):- Tony sends Steve a dick pic on accident and what started as slightly uncomfortable attempts at texting soon turns into a real friendship that leads to sexting and eventually an actual relationship- The fic spans the events of Captain America the Winter Soldier, Steve tells Tony that Bucky killed his parents pretty much right away and after a bout of anger and some angsty angst Tony gets over himself and they pick up where they left off. Tony agrees to help Steve find Bucky and bring him home. They haven't had much success yet.- At the end all the Avengers live together in the tower, Tony and Steve share the penthouse- The Avengers know about their relationship and support them. The fic ends with Tony publicly announcing their relationship via an Instagram post
