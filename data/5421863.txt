----All of the Avengers sans Tony gathered in the Common Area. They had ordered food, but no one was really eating it. It was too quiet. There was no one to throw hearted barbs with/at Clint, with questions for Thor, and to have flirty, loveable banter with Steve and Bucky. Throw in requests at JARVIS to make notes of this and that, and no one knew how the hell Tony juggled all these conversations.  But his absence was definitely noticed.  It wasn't just dinner that was different. Movie Night was pretty much dead on arrival, because no matter how much the team told him to shut up, his commentary made the movie more interesting and funny. So sitting in silence during a movie was just awkward. Steve and Bucky felt cold without their third piece of the huddle. There was no one to snuggle up to, or warm their front. The blanket wasn't the same. Pretty much everyone had vacated for the night. The bed was too large, and they knew it wasn't actually true. Even with just the two of them, the California King wasn't roomy. But with nothing to squish between them, they just felt...droopy. Sleep didn't come easily. There was no petting, or snuggling, or whispered half-asleep Italian to lull them into unconsciousness. Steve felt cold, and Bucky felt his nightmares sneak up on him in the darkness. How did this happen? They both knew.-----"Tony. You know that you can't just shirk off business like this." Tony glared up at Steve through exhausted eyes. He had been up for days, emphasizing to Steve and Bucky that he had to much shit to deal with to sleep, and that he wouldn't be able to sleep anyways. He was so not in the mood for this. "I think I know that, Steve. The new schematics for the arrows Clint requested are being a pain in the ass.""Well, I'm sorry dollface, but this is the fourth time this morning that Pepper has called and demanded you come in for an R&D inspection.""And she can't do it because...?" Natasha walked in at that moment, clucking her tongue on the way to the coffee machine. "Because that's not her job, Stark. I was only undercover in your company for about a month, and even I saw that you put her through her paces.""I don't mean to, Romanov. If I didn't have to, I wouldn't. But now that I have Avengers shit and SHIELD shit to deal with, I'm going to have to let a little bit of it trickle down.""Doesn't seem like trickling down to me, Stark. It's more like dumping a bucket."  Before Tony could retort about how yes, he did feel shitty about that, Clint chose that moment to hop down from the ceiling. Bucky winced. Now was not the time. He could stuff his other boyfriend's mouth, but Barton was out of his reach. "Hey, Stark. How are my arrows coming?""They're a pain in the ass, Barton.""Aww, come on!""Sorry, asswipe. It's not like I didn't have to fight fucking sentient statues last week.""You fixed your suit up!" Again, before Tony could say 'fuck you, asshole, that's to make sure I don't die', Bruce's voice rang in on the speakers. "Tony, one of your experiments just let off a spark.""Yes, Bruce, sweetie. It's prone to doing that.""I have sensitive experiments right next to you, Tony. If one of those sparks travels, it could ruin my data.""I have it contained, Bruce. I took measurements.""Well, Tony, your measurements might not always be correct, and I'd prefer it if you take more precaution." Tony was ready to shout that he 'did take precautions, Bruce, because he understood about sensitive experiments, and that his measurements might not always be correct, but they had damn well been so far when it came to them-'when Pepper strolled in. Tony gave up and let his head slam onto the kitchen island. He was too tired to deal with this shit right now- "Sit up, Tony. I'm tired of you acting like a spoiled child. I've had to contact Steve at this point, because you're not answering your phone! I've let you play with your toys long enough, Tony. You need to go get dressed and take some responsibility for a change-" He didn't know what had happened. He was usually better at dealing with shit than this. But the constant stream of criticism and mental accusations of not being good enough had him imagining a face that he kept locked away so far and deep in his subconscious that he was surprised (and a little disappointed to be honest) that he hadn't shit out the memory. It was like someone had just gone 'lol nope', and cut through his taught string of tolerance with a pair of scissors. He felt hot, and shaky, and angry. Was this what Bruce felt like? Because it was like an all-encompassing fire was burning through him, leaving him pissed off, tired, and with a desire to scream. Steve immediately felt wary at his lovers shaking silence, and reached a hand out to rest on his shoulder. To say that he was surprised when it was smacked away was an understatement. Nobody moved, or even breathed. Tony lifted his head, eyes narrowed into slits, expression contorted into a mixture of frustration and irritated b
