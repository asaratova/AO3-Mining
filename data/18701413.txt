Chapter Text
Chapter One: The Bad Day“Tony,” Pepper’s voice sounded distant, but he knew what it meant; it meant that he had survived, albeit with a fair amount of damage, and that he had somehow recovered. “Tony, you need to wake up.”“God, wasn’t there a time when all you wanted me to do was sleep?” he groaned and opened one eye. “You’re beautiful and I love you, by the way.”That was something he never got tired of saying. Not ever.She smiled and it lit up his whole world, “I love you too.”“Daddy!” Morgan called as she careened into the room, she was still in her pajamas.“Baby!” he echoed far more cheerfully than he ever would have thought possible this early in the morning.“I love you Daddy.”“I love you too,” Tony’s heart was so full as he held his little girl.“Tony, I need to run to the office,” Pepper cut in as she kissed both of their heads. “I’ll be back for lunch.”“Daddy, I don’t like New York,” Morgan sighed far too heavily for a five-year-old. “Mommy always works.”Pepper’s face fell, but he held their daughter closer. “Baby, Mommy is home for lunchtime and at suppertime and she even has breakfast with you a lot. Mommy also does family movie night, and we go for walks in the park and we play games—Mommy is here a lot.”The little girl’s face lit up, “And you’re here a lot too! We play lots of games and watch cartoons and work in the workshop!”“Exactly, and you know we both love you very much,” Pepper insisted as she dropped another kiss on the little girl’s forehead. “Always.”Morgan nodded emphatically. “Yes Mommy.”“And before you know it, we’ll be back at the cabin for a few weeks. I promise.” Tony kissed his daughter’s cheek. “You’ll see.”The grin she gave him made his heart swell several sizes. “And, we can take Petey too?”Pepper laughed, “If his aunty says yes, then yes we can take him.”Tony grinned broadly. His daughter and his son—well, his sort of son—were thick as thieves, spending time with them was one of his favorite things. The city was still getting back on its feet, but with summer in full swing for at least another three weeks, Peter would be being Spider-Man and enjoying freedom to his geeky heart’s content.“This is gonna be a good day!” Morgan told him excitedly as Pepper bid them farewell and reminded them to eat. It was not a good day.In fact, crisis hit right before supper. At first, things had gone very smoothly; FRIDAY had kept him and Morgan on schedule in terms of food, play time, naptime, and when they both needed to get out of the workshop and breathe some fresh air. DUM-E had been watching Morgan for most of the time that Tony had taken it upon himself to repair Steve’s shield.First he loses the damn thing like five hundred times, then he breaks it?It had all been going smoothly, really. Pepper was back at five, which was a little earlier than usual, but he and Morgan were already making supper.“Daddy I don’t think we need that much garlic,” his daughter said as she looked up from her STARKpad that held the recipe she had been reading.“Baby, garlic is the spice of life,” he retorted, but stopped adding any more of it anyway.Morgan giggled, “Daddy, that’s variety not garlic.”“Oooooh! Is that so?” Tony grinned back at her, she was such a joy.“Are you two doing science experiments in my kitchen?” Pepper asked mock suspiciously as she reached the counter where Morgan was sitting.“No!” he answered at the same time as his daughter, and for good measure added the most innocent face he could muster; he could see Morgan doing the same out of the corner of his eye.“We’re cooking!” the little girl exclaimed throwing her arms up.“Well, maybe I can help,” Pepper laughed and kissed their daughter. “So that it’s edible.”“Hey!” he was about to retort that she had somehow managed to burn water once, but his phone rang.It was playing the Star Wars theme, Peter’s favorite. “Hey Kiddo, you dropping by for supper?”“Um, Mr. Stark—Mr. Stark, Peter needs your help,” this was not Peter, it was his friend Ned.“Ted? Where’s Peter? What’s going on?” Force of habit he said the kid’s name wrong, but the panic was starting to build.“He’s okay, we’re at the hospital, but—”Pepper looked alarmed, if his words hadn’t given him away, his tone of voice definitely wasn’t calm. Morgan had grown quiet and was reaching for her mother.“What? Is he okay? What are the doctor’s saying? Where’s his aunt?”“He’s not hurt physically,” Ned said quickly, the kid didn’t sound very sure of himself. “It’s May, she—she was in a car accident and—Mr. Stark, she died on impact.”Oh God.“Mr. Stark? Mr. Stark social workers are here; they’re trying to figure out what to do with Peter. He needs your help.”
Oh God, my kid.
“I’m on my way, Ned don’t let them do anything. I am coming. I’m coming and don’t let them do anything or I’m going to sue them until they won’t even have claim to their own pocket lint, you hear me?”Ned was definit
