Chapter 1: Having a Fiery Bilingual S/O (Poe and Kylo)
    




Chapter Text

Poe Dameron

He thinks it is Sexy as Hell™
Seriously, this boy would get you mad just to hear you curse him out in another language
Honestly, at this point you’re not sure whether to find it annoying or flattering
In all seriousness though, he loves your fire and spunk
He knows you’ll take absolutely zero shit and will call him out when he crosses the line
He may not admit it, but he really does need it and appreciates it when you do
(Look me in the eye and tell me he wouldn’t love an s/o who could kick his ass)
He’ll probably ask you to teach him your second language
He’s not fluent, but he picks up a few phrases here and there to make you blush in public

Kylo Ren

Let’s be honest, Kylo is…intense…so having a fiery s/o brings out that side of him more often then not
If you have force powers there is a lot of broken furniture and torn out doorways from the pair of you throwing shit at each other when you have a fight
Even if you don’t have powers, things still get thrown
(Lightsaber fights to work out your issues that get a little too heated)
You sometimes slip into a different language when you argue and that ALWAYS makes it worse since he feels the need to correct you
“Y/N, speak basic!”  “Don’t you ‘Y/N basic me!’“
On the other hand, he loves it
He loves how passionate you can be
He loves how you don’t take any crap from anybody even him, but especially Hux
(Low key turns him on when he sees you cursing out Hux for some idiotic thing he did)
And in quiet moments when it’s just the two of you he tries his hand at your second language
He’s not very good, and you try your best not to laugh, but he tries
