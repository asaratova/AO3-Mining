Chapter One:
A beautiful day, the perfect day if one can say, hit New York City. It's a summer day with a temperature not too cool, but not too hot. Just the right temperature to be comfortable. The children frolic and play and road rage is at a minimum. Not a cloud of a side or a hint of a hitch of an arrangement. It's a perfect day to be alive.Spider-Man swings over the streets of New York City. By now, everyone knows his story. He came out on the scene around a decade ago, and started fighting crime. He matures from an awkward teenager fighting some of the most colorful rogues in the world to a decorated hero and a member of the Avengers. Some may call him a threat or a menace, but many more grow to respect him over the years."And today's such a beautiful day. What kind of person can ruin such a fantastic..."A loud explosion causes Spider-Man to jerk out of his thoughts. The buzz in the back of his head signifies the spider sense going off."That...that kind of person can ruin a perfect day!"The web slinger zips over to the sound of the explosions. He realizes it comes from one of the man branch banks in the city."Bank? Of course it has to be a bank. Criminals always have to go for the obvious. Why can't they switch it up? Or maybe take up a different hobby?"Spider-Man jumps down and sees a large man wielding a crowbar. He wears a purple ski mask over his head and Spider-Man grumbles the second he spots the man. The hostages on the ground show that these guys play for keeps, which he unfortunately knows.
'Wrecker, one fourth of the Wrecking Crew. Great, when he's around, the other three can't be that far beyond. Okay, Spider-Man, let's do this.'
The large man paces back and forth. Wrecker turns to the whimpering hostages on the ground."Alright, listen up! We're going to do this the easy way. No one causes any trouble, no one gets hurt. If you cause trouble, you're going to be in big trouble. Got that?""Yeah, how about you let the hostages go and cut out the middle man?"Wrecker's eyes turn around to eye Spider-Man who drops down from the ceiling."You!"The rallying battle cry of the bad guy goes off. Wrecker charges Spider-Man with intent to maim. Spider-Man avoids the swing of the crowbar and jumps up high into the air. He sends a line of webbing at the back of the crowbar and gives a nice pull. Wrecker almost falls down with a thud on the ground."Yeah, it's me! And for the record, the only people who will be in trouble is you!""Yeah, well you're going to be breathing out of the other side of your face, web head!""Yeah, real matur..."Wrecker swings once again towards Spider-Man. Spider-Man ducks it and grabs his arm before throwing him out of the front entrance of the bank. He jumps into the air and shoots webbing at his arm before ascending to a lamp post and dangling him above it."Don't bother getting down on my account? I'll find my way in!"Spider-Man takes a couple of steps forward to the bank. He wonders where the rest of the Wrecking Crew is. He gets his answer when a large wrecking ball swings at him. Spider-Man climbs up on top of the wrecking ball and begins to run down the chain. He slams a fist into the face of Wrecker to drive him down to the ground."You won't stop us, web slinger!"Piledriver jumps into the fray with his large hands. Spider-Man avoids the fists of furry and comes back with one of his own. A stinging punch catches Piledriver down before Spider-Man leaps up and hooks the man's head with his legs before doing a backflip and spiking Piledriver onto his head."Hey, I just hit Piledriver with a piledriver. Imagine that if you..."Spider-Man stops short of reaching maximum quippage when Bulldozer comes out of the bank, holding the hostage under his hand. Thunderball joins him after cutting Wrecker down."Not so fast, web slinger! You want the lady to get hurt? I don't have a problem with that? But you, as a do-gooder, you have a big problem with that.""He's not the only one who has a problem with that."An attractive blonde woman wearing a tight red suit with a hole cut out at the stomach turns up. Her long hair ties in a ponytail, a black domino mask covers her face, and thigh high red boots. The members of the Wrecking Crew look up in anger when they come face to face with Carol Danvers, or Captain Marvel."Hey, my mother said not to hit a lady."Wrecker just flashes a grin."Good thing my mother's not here.""Yeah, she would not be happy of you being out in public with that hair cut," quips Spider-Man.A swing and a miss as Captain Marvel dodges the attack. This distraction allows Spider-Man to pluck the hostage out of the hands of Bulldozer. Bulldozer growls when losing his leverage and takes a swing at Spider-Man."That didn't work the first time!"The web slinger zips down and crashes down onto the back of Bulldozer's head. One stinging punch drops the member of the Wrecking Crew down to the ground.Piledriver and Thunderball both get up, until another figure fro
