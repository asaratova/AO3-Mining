CHAPTER ONE:  Introduction 
  
  “It is 12:00 am on August 10, 2020- as of this moment I am eighteen fucking years old and you don’t fucking own me anymore Tony Stark. I, Peter Benjamin Stark, out of sound body and fucking mind, under absolutely no coercion and out of my complete freaking own will, hereby forfeit my role as heir to Stark Industries, my right to my trust fund, and anything else I was set to fucking inherit from Tony fucking Stark. I am leaving and I am never fucking coming back, don’t expect to hear from me again.”  Tony Stark never wanted kids. He thought he wasn't cut out for the whole dad thing.He was right.For eighteen years Peter Stark has lived in a prison filled with press conferences, college-level calculus, and cold nannies.Now he is done- he is a legal adult and there is absolutely nothing keeping him at Stark Towers anymore. And just like that, he leaves with no intention of ever returning to that penthouse prison.
