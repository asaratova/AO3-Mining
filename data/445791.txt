Chapter Text
Clint’s never been much of a team player. The world’s never really shown him how to do anything but look out for his own hide. Maybe add in a couple of other people along the way, but mostly he looks out for number one, and screw anyone else who gets in the way. He’s the little brother, so he never feels the urge to look out for Barney, who’s three years older than him and can actually remember what their parents looked like. Clint was only four when they died, and all he remembers of his mother is an aura of beaten-down trepidation, and his father holds a space in his mind reserved for stale beer, heavy footsteps, and a loud, angry voice. He doesn’t remember actually being hit by him, but Barney tells him that they had both been on the receiving end of their father’s fist, and their mother had caught the worst of it for trying to protect them. Clint had never been able to tell when Barney was lying or not when he was a kid though, so who really knew?   Hawkeye is born in Carson’s Carnival of Travelling Wonders, which he and Barney join not long after his tenth birthday. They catch Mr Carson after the show in the big top and beg to join, showing him their orphan’s lunch cards to prove that they had no one to leave behind and wouldn’t be missed anyway. Carson tells them in his slow, sarcastic drawl (so different from his booming, clearly enunciated ringmaster voice) to see Vinny, who has been known to take passengers in his van from one town to the next for a small fee. So they hitch a ride with Vinny, and join the circus. After sticking around for a month and proving their worth by performing a hundred odd jobs, Carson finally smiles his slow smile and starts to pay them for their trouble. Clint learns the circus like a map and learns to make it his own. The circus in the mid-eighties wasn’t the best environment for a child, he realises in retrospect – he was taught to hold his drink at a criminally young age, he knew what naked women looked like in real life far before any of the kids his age in the audience, and he picked up more curse words than a sailor and utilised them as much as he pleased, much to the amusement of those who had taught them to him. The circus glows bright and colourful in his memories of childhood. He first holds a bow in Trickshot’s tent, and learns to throw a knife from the Swordsman. Cook teaches him the tricks of the kitchen when he’s still too short to even see the countertop (he’s a short, skinny kid), and the three Janets show him how to backflip and somersault without hurting himself or landing flat on his face. It isn’t always perfect – the circus has always been a good place for unsavoury characters to hide from normal life, and Clint learns quickly to avoid certain people – Karl the animal keeper, Pete the mechanic, Hal the strongman. Some people don’t like kids who move too fast and are too smart for their own good, so Clint learns to shut up and do his job when needed. Besides, they leave him alone when he starts to bring in good money. Clint Barton is a skinny kid with a smart mouth who runs full-tilt between the tents and vans and has an irritating tendency to climb anything, from trees to caravans to the inside of the big top, and spy on people just because he likes to know everything that goes on in the strange, sprawling place he’s learning to call home. Hawkeye is a prodigious child archer who can hit apples thrown by the ringmaster standing on the floor of the ring while flying through the air on the trapeze, upside down. When they hit a new town, Hawkeye can be relied on to bring in the starry-eyed kids by doing a few fancy tricks in the streets under one of the posters, which has his name in big letters painted across it – HAWKEYE THE CHILD WONDER! HE NEVER MISSES! Every kid dreams of running away to join the circus, after all. Through Hawkeye, a real child circus star, they can live that dream. Clint never thinks of Barney, not as fast, not as skilled, left behind to be an odd jobs-man while Hawkeye is trained by Trickshot and the Swordsman, two of the best attractions in the carnival. He looks out for number one, and doesn’t see it coming when Barney leaves, leaving him a short note on his bunk in the van they share (Clint learns to drive as soon as he’s tall enough to reach the pedals and see over the dashboard at the same time). Fifteen years old, and Clint reads the note and doesn’t know how to react. Barney says he’s joining the army, and Clint sits on his bunk in silence and realises that Barney’s left all of his trinkets and personal belongings behind. He’s taken some of his clothes, and that’s it. Clint sits in silence for maybe an hour, maybe two, and falls asleep in his clothes, which had be
