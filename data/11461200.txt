“Stark." Loki landed on the ground and stomped towards Tony. "Call your team off, or I will be forced to hurt them."  "Will you?" Tony shot back, and raised his arm to aim the repulsor right at the Trickster God. "Because every time we do this sort of thing, you end up retreating."  Loki narrowed his eyes and stalked even closer and Tony smirked. In his suit he was the same height as the overly tall bastard, and he completely enjoyed not having to look up to talk down to him. He even opened his faceplate so Loki could absolutely see the smug look on his face.  "So maybe--" he continued with a short laugh. "--you should take all that bluster and bullshit you carry around with you, and that ridiculous cape and maybe just--WHOA!"  Tony ducked and scrambled back a few steps when Loki summoned his magic and shot a bolt of energy at him.  "God it's so rude to interrupt me when I'm monologuing!" Tony snapped and fired a few shots off, hating how much he enjoyed the effortless way Loki seemed to dodge them.  They fought hard for a few minutes, trading blasts and snarky one liners, until Tony popped a repulsor that should have blown a hole in the Demi gods chest, but instead Loki just wrinkled his nose and disappeared--  --- and reappeared right in Tony's space, so close that Tony stumbled back into a wall, and Loki pressed close to him, a curious look on his face.  "You are adorable when you are cocky." That low voice was suddenly entirely too close to Tony's ear, and Tony had to swallow back his initial reaction (which was definitely not a moan. It wasn't) and had to lick his lips, which only drew that green gaze down. “I much prefer your brand of courage to the rest of these quivering mortals.”“Tell me,  Anthony  .” Tony's full name rolled of Loki's tongue sounding  entirely  too good. “When you take this suit off--” Loki glanced down. “Do you prefer to wear silk or--”“Tony!” The shout distracted Loki, who turned just in time to see Captain's shield flying toward him.Tony's face mask slammed down and he was blasting away in a split second, and Loki barely managed to dodge the shield, sending a fierce glare at the Captain before shimmering away into nothing.Tony flew off towards the tower, unsure of why his heart was pounding a little too hard, and why he couldn't quite wipe the smile from his face.********************It happened again, some time later. Another battle, another army of minions, Loki at the forefront with his magic and that stupid cape.And maybe it was Tony's imagination but Loki seemed to be seeking him out, keeping him dodging blasts from whatever magically charged weapon Loki had this time. But Loki couldn't actually hit Tony at all, and about halfway through the fight Tony realized Loki was missing on purpose.“What's your deal, Reindeer Games?” Tony flew in low and shouted at him, and Loki laughed out loud, looking entirely too pleased to see him.“Perhaps you should consider yourself lucky I have not put you in the ground, Anthony Stark.”Dammit, there it was again, his name said like that and Tony had to fight the shiver.“Keep saying my name like that and I'll expect a date!” He called, and then there was a burst of light, a sharp pull and he landed ass first in the ground, his suit jarred enough to be temporarily offline.“What in the actual fu--”Loki had grabbed him with what looked like a lasso? made of light, and had yanked him right from the sky and into the dirt.Tony opened his mask with a huff, but Loki was already leaning over him, a smile curving his lips.“And on this date, would you prefer whiskey or scotch?”Tony stared up into green eyes and managed to stutter, “Sc-scotch.”“Hmm.” Loki hummed and looked down at his mouth, and then was gone, rematerializing halfway across the field, leaving Tony feeling like he'd been propositioned and sort of liking it.**********************A few days later, an ornately decorated box arrived at Tony's office, and inside lay an equally ornate bottle of scotch with some impossible date on it, and several symbols he couldn't read.The note simply read
 Anthony, 

 I expect a date soon. 
Tony crumpled the note in his pocket and coughed hard to explain the sudden blush, and put the bottle away under his bed.*************************Steve stormed into the common area several weeks later, already suited up, shield ready.“Loki is at it again. Doing something upstate. Tony, suit up and let's go. Nat and Clint are already on the jet.”“I'll just fly.” Tony offered and was in his suit and out the window before Steve had even made it back out to the jet.He found Loki high upstate, sitting serenely in a meadow in a meditative pose.“Are you kidding me?” Tony landed with a  thunk . “You're hanging out in the flowers? Where's your army? I haven't destroyed any weird alien minions in a while.”“Hello, Anthony.”“God, I thought you were gonna call me Clarice.” Tony retorted, but there wasn't any real heat behind it, and by the way Loki smiled… he knew.“It's conside
