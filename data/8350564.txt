Summary:

Tony growing up...





Chapter Text
After the 2nd World War and the battle against Hydra ended in 1945 it was thought that Captain America was lost forever. His brave act of sinking the plane that carried a bomb that would have cost many lives would not be forgotten. He was a hero and since they didn't have a body to bury, those who considered him a friend decided to honor him. Peggy Carter and Howard Stark decided to change the name of the SSR to Shield in honor of their fallen friend. They worked hard and it was just after the year 1975 when Shield was fully and successfully operational. With his part done, Howard decided he needed to settle down soon.  Unknown to anyone else but the late Doctor Erskine, Howard and Peggy had been administered with a watered down version of the super soldier serum. They aged slower than normal and were a bit stronger than humanly possible. So although Howard was actually 60 he looked and had the body of a 38 year old. Lucky for him, printed press wasn't advanced enough yet for people to question his extended life and youth. With his decision to settle down in mind, Howard decided to start dating and look for a partner he could see himself spending many years with. He finally met a woman he felt was worthy to be his wife. In the year 1983 he married a young 23year old Italian woman by the name of Maria Carbonell and they seemed to be happy. With society naming them as the it couple, life seemed to be going perfectly for Howard. A few years after marriage Maria became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Anthony Edward Stark was born in the year 1986. Peggy Carter was named godmother and Howard was content with his life it seemed. He ran a successful weapons company, was rich, had a wife and now an heir to the Stark name. What more could a man want? But unknown to anyone Howard was restless. It was 2 years after Tony was born that Howard Stark realized that he was restless because they still had not found Steve. With this realization, Howard decided that until Anthony could be of use to him he had no interest in him. With Peggy focused on shield, she only saw Tony on special holidays. Howard Stark spent his time trying to find his "diamond" Steve Rogers while keeping up with demands of weapons creation. He realized that with the way the world was moving and that maybe he should venture into other avenues for his company to ensure its continued sustainability. He was so stuck in chasing the past that he ignored the future that was in front of him. He didn't spend much time with his family anymore instead he put all his focus in trying to find Captain America. He created new innovations in an attempt to find Steve and when they didn't work he would have them sold through Stark Industries so that he would have more funds to keep searching for Steve. In his focus he missed the many milestones his son Anthony achieved. His first word, when he began to crawl, when he began to walk and when he became interested in creating things far more advance than any normal child. He didn't even notice when Tony would observe him silently in the lab. He also was not made aware that Tony loved watching his mother as she pampered herself. How he loved to play with her hair and refused getting a hair cut. How he like to roll in his mother's many coats and how he would smile blindingly whenever he had his hair brushed. The first major achievement Howard ignored was the creation of a circuit board by Anthony at the age of 4. In fact Howard was so distracted that he stepped on in it when it was in his path and screamed at Anthony to keep out of his work space. He had hurt his foot on the damned thing meaning he had to put off going to search for Steve for at least a week. He locked himself in his study and designed a few more weapons to keep Stark Industries up to date on the latest in weapons designs. Howard also contemplated a new metal detector design. The second important event was when Maria took Anthony for an intelligence assessment and was confirmed a genius. Anthony's mind worked in a wondrous way and he saw things differently. He also had an artistic side that Maria and Anna absolutely adored from the young Stark heir. His ability to imagine and create that which he imagined, helped him win the science competition hosted by MIT at the age of 6. The competition was actually meant for high school students and the only reason they let Anthony compete was because of his Stark surname. Even though the other students believed he won only because of his father's name, the press and judges realized that it was because of his genius design. His father was not there to support him but Edwin Jarvis and his mother were present for the event. Even Aunt Peggy showed up after to congratulate him. With his win, various newspaper outlets came to interview young Anthony Stark while Howard was off following a lead on Captain America.
