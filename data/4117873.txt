Chapter 1: Eavesdroppers never hear anything good
    




Chapter Text
Darcy honestly hadn’t meant to eavesdrop.  She was in the Avengers communal kitchen reheating some leftover pad thai for Jane’s lunch and rocking out to her iPod.  As the playlist ended, she realized she wasn’t alone.  The resident geriatric supersoldier contingent was sitting on a large couch less than ten feet from her.  So much for Maria Hill’s situational awareness training.  Darcy was supposed to notice things like Captain America and Bucky Barnes having a hushed conversation practically under her nose.  She planned to correct the mistake by pretending she couldn’t hear them and vacating the common area as soon as the microwave beeped.“It's never going to happen Steve,” Bucky was saying.  “Hydra introduced half a dozen women to me by saying 'I promise I am no minion of evil and we can share your man'. Sometimes I was instructed ahead of time with what to say back.”“That doesn’t make them your soulmates,” Steve replied with quiet conviction. “Hydra was profaning something sacred to control you.”“Don’t care what it says on my arm,” Bucky insisted.  “You are the only soulmate I need.”As the microwave finished, Darcy fled.  The soulmate greetings were traditionally secret.  Mostly to preserve the wonder of the first words you would say to your other half, but also to prevent fraud.   Some people were lucky enough to have distinctive sentences, but ‘Good morning’ or ‘One drip coffee and a danish’ were far more common.  Darcy’s first roommate in college had the words ‘Is this seat taken?’ on her arm.  The poor girl had word matched three boys and four girls by the time she graduated.  However, she had fallen madly in love with the second match so Darcy supposed it had worked out.  Her roommate claimed she knew instantly that he was the right one.Darcy touched her words through the masking sleeve that she had worn since just before her twelfth birthday.  When the old fashioned script had appeared on her forearm, she had been equal parts grateful and puzzled. 'I expected Hydra to be the one to try to steal my man' was unlikely to lead to false matches, but it hadn’t made a lot of sense. Darcy was certain she now had an answer to the mystery.  She was the soulmate of Bucky Barnes, traumatized ex-assassin, who was just starting to respond to therapy.This was an unexpected complication to Darcy’s basic life plan.  She had followed Jane to New York to rule the overqualified science grunts that Tony Stark had promised the absentminded scientist and finally draw a paycheck.  Finishing her degree could wait until Jane was settled and Darcy’s bank account contained more than $12.67.  No one had questioned her right to move herself into one of the spare bedrooms on the Avengers floor.  Well Tony Stark tried once, but he quickly decided that anyone who made good coffee and had tazzed Thor could stay. She had not anticipate a super ethical dilemma.Captain America and the Black Widow had captured the Winter Soldier about a month before Darcy and Jane moved in, but he had been confined to a reinforced floor of the tower until a couple days ago.  Darcy had seen Steve and Bucky around the Avengers floor once or twice, but it was the first time she had ever heard either of them speak.  It seemed unlikely they even knew who she was.Part of her wanted to march back into the room, say the words and claim her soulmate.  Bucky deserved to have both his life partners helping him through his recovery. But Darcy doubted the soldiers were oblivious to her having been in the room.  She could easily do more harm than good if Bucky suspected she had overheard. The last thing he needed was a stranger barging in to claim a part of the life he was still putting back together.  Darcy decided the best course was to be patient. It wasn’t saying the words that bonded two souls.  They just allowed people to recognise the connection.  Darcy didn’t need mutual acknowledgement to know the right thing to do.  Her help and support were not contingent on anything.  The words would come when they were meant to.Darcy delivered Jane’s lunch and stopped by Dr. Banner’s lab.“Hey big guy, have you eaten yet?” Darcy asked cheerfully.  Bruce looked up from the microscope he had been painstakingly focusing.“Yes,” he answered kindly.  Bruce was far more careful with his blood sugar than most of the other scientists.“Anything I should add to the grocery order this week?” Darcy took pride in making sure that all the people under her care had a constant supply of their favorite foods.“Some more of the ginger green tea,” Bruce suggested hesitantly.  “Absolutely,” agreed Darcy with a warm smile. “And what do I need to add for Bucky.”  Darcy always figured it was easier to ask forgiveness than permission.  If she just took over stocking stuff for Bucky, it was unlikely anyone would question her.Bruce looked pensive. “Hydra did a number of his digestive system.  We are easing him into eating solid
