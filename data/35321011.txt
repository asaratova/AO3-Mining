Chapter 1: My Hero Academia
    


Notes:
Enjoy my first poorly written storyline - Izuku Midoria centric

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text
My Hero Academia
- izuku has a quirk that transfers people’s pain to him with skin contact
- Was originally just the pain, but the physical wounds and effects transferred as well as the quirk evolved (causes scarring)
- Includes cuts, soreness, broken bones, effects of drugs and alcohol (hangovers), headaches,scrapes , sickness, and any other pain a person experiences
- Basically a heal all quirk with awful side affects
- Once the quirk manifests, Inko Midoriya becomes slowly abusive (verbally and physically)
- Kids at school and inko use him for healing all the time, causing Izuku a lot of pain
- He runs away from home to the red light district at age 10
- Doesn’t meaningly become a vigilante, but sometimes helps various people in return for food and other things (from muggings, rapists, sickness, etc.)
- Learns to fight very well from experience, and is familiar with crime in the area
- Always wears long pants, long sleeve shirt, hoodie with a beanie, and a face mask pretty much all the time (as little skin showing as possible)
- Eventually gets on the police and hero’s radar, and is found and put into foster care after about 4 years of being in the streets
- Trauma makes foster care very hard, but befriends Shinsou (they both learn sign language and trauma bond)
- Izuky has an extreme fear of human contact , trauma from physical and verbal beatings, claustrophobia, emotional detachment, very high pain and hunger tolerance, insomnia, extreme paranoia, major distrust of adults and authority in general, and is partially non verbal (with a stutter and improper language (slang)
- After a lot of development, izuku tries to become a hero and befriends Aizawa (enter dadzawa ;) )
- He is underestimated because he has a healing quirk, but is very skilled at hand to hand combat
