Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
Never had you seen so much snow in your life. Peering out of the window, you marvelled at the white sheets coming down and adding to the already thick piles that surrounded your truck. It was beautiful, that was for sure, but if you dawdled for much longer then it would likely also become lethal.Pressing your foot a little harder on the gas, you tried to shake the cold that was creeping into your bones. The heating in your truck had given up a month ago, and now even the thick gloves on your hands couldn’t protect you from the frost, especially not the kind that came from a nameless mountain in Canada in the beginnings of winter.Ah, the things we do for family.Your eyes briefly left the road and flickered to the picture on your dashboard. You’d been adopted when you were a baby, and unfortunately the only member of the family you’d ever grown close to was your youngest sister, Rhea. She’d never seen you as anything other that her big sister, and your personalities complimented each other’s perfectly. It was a give and take relationship, one that you’d treasured. You’d even been planning on going to college together, until she up and left suddenly a few years back and hadn’t really been in contact since. Her blue eyes shone out from the picture and your heart ached. It had been too long since you’d last seen her; two years ago, in fact, on her nineteenth birthday. She was turning twenty two in a week and after much insistence on your part she’d finally given an address.But now, as your card barely avoided tipping over a narrow edge, you wondered if she was pulling your leg.Gritting your teeth, you slowed the car and took a deep breath. By far this was one of the most terrifying things you’d ever done; it even beat Hide ‘n Seek in the cellars when Bradly Rolf leapt out at you and scared you so bad that you were still scared of dark places at twenty four years old. The thought of all the black ice under the wheels was enough to have you consider turning around, so you quickly shook your head and dismissed it. How did Rhea even survive up here? The nearest market was miles back and there was no shopping centres within an hour’s drive. She’d better have a good explanation for this or you’d go apeshit.All you could do was concentrate on the road, holding your breath every time the car slid back slightly and every time you passed a sharp corner. It all looked the same, just white nothing everywhere. A couple of times you could have sworn you saw the tops of trees poking out from the snow, but it terrified you to think of how deep it was so you didn’t. Pushing your glasses further up your nose, you realised how ridiculous you looked. You were on the edge of your seat, cheeks flushed red and the rest of your face pale, fingers so tight around the wheel that you were half convinced the jaws of life would have to pry them away. Squinting at the road, you shuffled gleefully in your seat when you saw what looked to be giant iron gates and an intercom box next to them.You frowned. Rhea mentioned living in some kind of community, but this looked way beyond her budget.You kicked the door open once you reached the box, hopping outside and almost immediately slipping. The windows had stopped function a few months back too and even the doors had their days. Tugging one glove off and wincing at the bite of the air, you pressed on the button repeatedly.It was probably only a few seconds but it felt like forever before someone answered. “Hello? Who’s there?” a voice called out.“Um, I’m here for Rhea Anmarry? I’m her sister.” you told the voice your own name, hoping that would be enough to get you in.The voice repeated your name. “So you’re the favourite sister? Of course, come in.”You blinked at the box for a few moments until the clanking of the gate prompted you to get back in your car. Favourite sister? You smiled at that. Perhaps Rhea had been missing you as much as you’d been missing her.💍 The drive up to the community had you again questioning your sister. The buildings were a mixture of cabins and normal houses, and to say they seemed luxurious would be an understatement. There were cute street lamps everywhere and you were pretty sure you even saw a post box, though in total there couldn’t have been more than thirty houses. There were no cars either, though you saw several motorbikes parked about. When the hell could you ride a motorbike in this weather?What kind of community was this?As you continued driving, you came to a huge building that would probably be described as a town hall. You could see a few people milling about inside and your stomach rumbled at the smell of whatever was cooking, reminding you that you hadn’t eaten since this morning. Turning the key in the ignition, you sat there for a minute. Now what? The voice had told you to drive up to the Centre, and to wait a few minutes. Your eyes flickered between the doors and the picture on your dash. Anxiety was risi
