Chapter 1: advesperascit
    


Summary:

Lydia has a sinking suspicion that Lord Stilinski is a dragon.



Notes:
Chapter Specific Tags: Dragon Stiles Stilinski (TW only)I kind of gave this one a Regency period vibe, but I wasn't necessarily thinking historical, but more along the lines of futuristic, with regency accents, in the same way that Firefly was a futuristic western. It's not really that applicable here, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.This bit is a special shout out to AliceMadness, who wasn't the first person to comment on one of my fics, but was the first to ask, "I like this; is there any chance you would continue it?" about something, and wanted more dragon Stiles. Thanks! This isn't much, I know, but I like it enough to maybe play around with it again sometime.




Chapter Text

advesperascit (v): the approaching dark; the evening draws near
<> <> <> <>The thing about dragons was that no one knew just when they were going to get tired of pretending to be human, and (according to superstition, at least) rise up to kill them all.Of course, many people believed that the dragons had died out decades ago; a theory that Lydia herself had agreed with until rather recently. Now, she was more than halfway convinced that they were even more dragons than the conspiracy theorists suspected, in hiding, just waiting for humans to kill themselves off.Furthermore, Lydia strongly suspected that one of those dragons was Stiles Stilinski. Lord Stilinski was by no measure an ordinary gentleman, and where that would have been a detriment to others, the young lord made his apparent weakness into a strength. He seemed to care very little for the rules of high society, preferring instead to seek out any intellectual pursuit that caught his fancy, no matter how fleeting, and unashamedly admitting to having far more books than friends. To snub Stiles was to do so at one’s own peril, and those who were wise listened when he spoke, even if he seemed not to make much sense at all. Lydia had long been both infuriated and grudgingly impressed by Stiles's unwillingness to follows the norms of his peers, but she was loathe to think that she had underestimated him to such a degree.Looking at him now from across the room, with the sunset peeking through the windows at his back, Lydia could easily imagine the young lord soaring triumphantly through the clouds. Or raining down fire on the masses below.Lord Stilinski turned slightly, as if he could sense her eyes upon him, and met her startled gaze. Lydia briefly started at being caught staring, but Stiles didn't give her any of the normal responses that he would normally offer at having caught the attention of another of the peerage; he didn't bow, or wink, or offer her his famous half-smirk, but simply looked back at her in a way that raised every hair on her arms.After a long, long moment, Lydia looked away first.“Hasn't anyone ever told you that it's best to let sleeping dragons lie?”Only years of training kept Lydia from jumping in surprise as Peter Hale and Christopher Argent appeared next to her elbow. According to rumor, the two men had been seen often going to Lord Stilinski’s manor as of late, though they had barely been friends only a few months ago. It was one of the many mysteries surrounding Stiles that Lydia wished to solve, especially if she intended to ask for his help.Peter, who had asked the question, was watching Lydia with barely-concealed mirth, though Christopher was looking at Stiles from where he had resumed his conversation across the room.“Lady Martin?” Peter prompted.Stiles might (or might not be, her inner scientist whispered) a dragon, but Peter Hale was just a man, and Lydia Martin could handle men, even those as clever and charming as he. She turned to him with a smile on her face and a question in her eyes. “I wasn't aware that you believed in dragons, my lord.”“Unfortunately, some things don't care whether you believe in them or not, they carry right on existing regardless,” he said lightly, and Lydia watched as he, too sought out Stiles across the room. With all three of them looking at him, Stiles glanced in their direction once more, and Lydia's breath caught at what she could have sworn was a flash of gold through Lord Stilinski's eyes. “And most of those things bite,” he added when they had once again turned away from Stiles.“Are you threatening me?”Peter opened his mouth, no doubt to say something cutting, but a unsubtle nudge from Christopher made him reconsider. Instead, he smiled. “I didn't know that you were capable of being threatened, Lady Martin. I apologize. I'm merely here to warn you that some things, once known, can never be unknown. Keep in mind that the thing that you wish for might not be worth the price you pay. Christopher and I are proof enough of that.”
