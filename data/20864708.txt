Chapter 1: Wanda and Peter meet
    




Chapter Text
There was nothing, absolutely nothing good about being a teenager. Whenever adults talked about how much they wished they could go back, they obviously had no idea what they were talking about and clearly had some gaps in their memory. You’re under constant stress, your hormones are all over the place, you’re always having to think about your future, you're expected to act like an adult but no one takes you seriously and you’re in a constant state of ‘no one understands me’. Now, this would be seen as dramatic to most people, but when you’re a teenager with telekinetic powers and were forced to stay inside for your own protection, the phrase ‘no one understands me’ can be pretty accurate. Wanda liked her room, she really did and she appreciated Tony letting her decorate. Growing up, she had always shared a room with her brother and she would always daydream about what it would be like to have her own space. This wasn’t how she imagined she would get it, but there you go. Wanda had a lot of time on her hands now. She read she cooked, she watched some American TV and trained with the others. Her days were pretty routine and she liked it. Routine was predictable and predictable was calm, but there is always the calm before the storm and this storm came in the shape of Peter Parker. Wanda had seen the videos and heard all about him on the internet. Someone was flying all over Queens and using webs to take down bad guys. It didn’t seem real and for someone like Wanda who had just about seen everything, it really was hard to believe. The blogs she read described him as a flash of blue and red, zipping past their camera phones. He had become famous for his quick comebacks and stopping moving vehicles with his bare hands. People had mixed feeling towards him, some said he was a godsend, looking out for the little guy. Others said that his powers made him dangerous and that he needed to be stopped. Wanda was with the former, he was helping people, who cared how he did it? People were always afraid of what they didn’t understand.Wanda and Peter met one afternoon when Tony was showing him some new tech he had made. She was sitting in the kitchen trying to decide what to cook that evening when they came in. He was cute, very cute in fact, she might have even said he was handsome, but cute seemed to suit him better. He was holding something, probably the new tech, and talking really fast with exaggerated hand gestures while Tony listened. The two were so caught up in their discussion that they didn’t notice Wanda at first. Then Peter turned and saw her. He stopped mid-sentence and his mouth fell open. Wanda blushed under his gaze and looked back at her cookbook. Tony, who noticed the exchange between the two teenagers smiled and gently pushed Peter in Wanda’s direction. “Underoo, this is Wanda, one of my favorite tenants. Wanda, this is Underoo a.k.a Spider-Man. I have to do... something in the lab and you two should be close in age, so have at it.” Tony patter Peter on the shoulder and headed out. “Don’t do anything I would do or anything I wouldn’t do.” He called from the hall. Peter and Wanda blushed at Tony’s words and smiled nervously at each other. “There’s a little grey area.” Peter explained. “I see.” She shook her head, she was too used to Tony by now.  “Um...I’m Peter, Peter Parker.” He put his hand out for her to shake and she happily took it. “Wanda Maximoff. So you’re the Spider-Man I’ve heard so much about.”“That’s me.” He said sheepishly. “Did you see the videos?” That seemed to be how most people outside of Queens heard about him.  “Yeah and I’ve read some blogs about you. I want you to know that I think what you're doing is good.” She said with a small smile. This made Peter’s smile grow. “Thanks, not everyone seems to agree with you.” He said thinking about the reporters and police who thought what he was doing was wrong and that he was no better than the criminals he took down. He thought the last part was a bit of an exaggeration. A sad smile crept onto her face, she looked at her hand and let the red energy dance between her fingers. She glanced at Peter, his expression was familiar, it was the same look that Tony had when he was solving an equation or when he was trying to get the pieces of one of his new toys to fit together; fascination... intrigue... wonder. The scientists who gave her powers would look at her in a similar way, as they filled out their results, but this was different. It was softer, warmer. “How did you get them?” She asked. “Spider bite, there was a school trip to the labs at Oscorp.” He explained. “I volunteered.” She explained. “My brother and I.” She waited, expecting him to ask questions. She expected that look of wonder to shift into something else, but it didn’t. He continued to look at her with fascination. “What are you making?” He asked, perhaps noticing her discomfort.  “I haven’t decided yet.” She said, pushing the
