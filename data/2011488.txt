Chapter 1: Introduction
    




Chapter Text
"You're all wimps, what's the worse thing that could happen? Someone hooks up in my closet? It wouldn't be the first time..." Tony trails off, luckily for everyone listening. You sat on the couch next to Natasha, who at the moment is staring at Stark like he just suggested they have an orgy."Why the hell would we want to do this? There's only two girls" she points out, "so unless you guys want to take the chance in the dark that you may get one of us, it's on."You glance around the group of people you had only met a little bit under a year ago. Luck was the first word to come to mind on how you got to assemble with some of the most well-known super humans on Earth. You had always known you were different from other people, but you had never taken attention to it until you had your first incident with your abilities. It hit national news, you had saved a young girl from an attacker on the street, and somehow something inside of you went into complete attack. You hadn't killed, but you put someone in their place, with a well placed hit over the head with a bat that wasn't exactly controlled by your hands. Despite the fact, Fury decided to take you in for training. Before you knew it you were introduced to the people you held over your head as idols. Being in the same room as them still hit you a little strange sometimes."Hey, (y/n), are you alright?" Steve asked. You had zoned off, apparently. You nodded and put your focus back on Tony's plan of playing some stupid game to give horny teenagers an excuse to try their best to hook up in a closet. How romantic. It appealed to you, though, the fact that you have the chance of a lifetime to be alone with one of the best in the league. It couldn't hurt to try."I'm in" you suddenly said, actually shocking yourself. Everyone's head turned in your direction. You looked to Natasha first, who perked her lips in interest. It was rather out of character of you to speak out. "I'm certainly not turning down the chance of having a girl to myself" Clint agreed, apparently sinking into it. You barely heard Bruce when he said something."A 22% chance? I'll take it."You see a grin cross Tony's face."Hey there's the spirit big guy, what about you, Steve? In or out?"You glanced over Natasha to glance at him. He looked uncomfortable for the moment that everyone was staring. He probably didn't have a lot of experience with peer pressure in his day."In" Steve said, with something that sounded almost like regret in his voice. You see Bucky perk up from the corner after hearing Steve, his eyes squint as if he's arguing himself on whether to do this or not."I am most certainly 'in' to this Midgardian experience" Thor suddenly speaks up, starling you a little with his enthusiasm. Poor guy, probably has no idea what he is getting himself into."In" a voice comes from the corner, Bucky, no doubt.Tony claps his hands together, leaning down and grabbing a leather business case and holding it up."Everyone put something of theirs in the bag, you take out someone's item, you go in with them" he explains, probably more for Thor and possibly for the two super soldiers. You see Natasha elbow Steve in a playful manner."Don't look so glum, you could get to make a move on a girl in a dark small space, romantic right?" You know she's teasing him, but it makes you laugh, the way Steve scrunches his face is disdain."Not exactly the first thing that popped in my head for 'romantic'" he admits. Suddenly a bag is shoved in your face by a rather impatient billionaire genius."Ladies first" he insists. You check yourself for some sort of object to give up for the game. Your eyes land on your necklace, and you unlatch it, setting it inside carefully. Natasha puts something in so quickly, you don't quite catch a glimpse. The bag makes its round on the group, and all eyes are on Tony."Who goes first?", and with that question, it's like he asks "who would like to die of embarrassment first?""I think (y/n) should go first, she is the newest member, after all" Natasha points out. Nobody seems to disagree with the idea, so Tony stands again and walks over to you, holding the bag out to you. "Pick your destiny" Tony says in a playful tone. You reach your hand in and pull out...
