Chapter 1: Training Day
    




Chapter Text
“Alright Parker, let’s get a move on”, said Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel as she was training fellow team member Peter Parker aka Spider-Man. For the past few weeks Peter has been dealing enemies that have martial arts background. Peter has been dealing a lot of different enemies ranging from Bullseye to the Hand Ninja to a mind controlled White Tiger. Seeing the beatings that Peter was taking Carol told him that they will be training together from now. At first Peter didn't think it was necessary but as time progressed he found that the lessons were paying off. It’s not to say that his ‘Way of the Spider’ lessons were useless but he just forgot about them. And so Peter and Carol continued to train together however today would be different.“Sorry I took so long to get here. There was an accident at Horizon Labs but it was taken care of” Peter told Carol. “So what are we doing today?”“Today we are going to do a few grappling moves so get ready”, Carol said. Peter and Carol got ready and started going at it. Peter quickly moved behind Carol and wrapped his arms around Carol’s waist. Carol used her legs tripped Peter from behind her and used her super strength to break his hold on her. She proceeded to lie on top of him. “Good try but not good enough Peter”, Carol smirked.“No fair you used your powers”, Peter said.“Yeah well I never said you couldn't use them”, Carol joked. Eventually Carol starts to doze off as something about Peter attracted her. Peter used this opportunity to flip her over and grabbed her and tackled her down. This was not a problem for Carol as she was much stronger than Peter. What concerned Carol was her sudden attraction to Peter and remembered how he mentioned an accident at Horizon Labs. “Hey Pete what happened at Horizon Labs?”“The accident was a leak of chemicals in the lab. One of the chemicals was a pheromone agent that would cause someone to fear you or attract them to you. I developed it so I could use on myself to scare crooks but gave up on it. Funny thing is I based it off of Jess so thaAGHHH”, Peter told her until she cut him off by reversing his hold her. “Hey, no fair, that’s cheating”.“It’s not cheating if you don’t use your powers. Well I guess that’s it for our practice session. Keep practicing those moves and maybe you might take me down”, Carol smirked. With that Carol and Peter left the Tower going to their respective apartments. Carol however couldn't get rid of the feeling she had earlier and it was driving her crazy. ‘Dammit Peter, what the hell did you do to me?’ Carol thought to herself. Having no other option she started masturbating as she tried to relieve herself of sexual tension. She continued to rub herself hard and the harder she did the more she thought of Peter. Finally she had an orgasm as she sprayed her bed with her juices. ‘Peter you got me into this and you are going to get me off’. Carol was running late as she needed to get something special. Peter was waiting on her at Avenger’s Tower. ‘Carol specifically told me to stay after everyone left the Tower for afterhours training. What does she want to show me?’ Peter thought to himself. After five minutes Carol appeared and Peter was shocked to her. Carol was her original Ms. Marvel suit today. A red and black long sleeve suit with no pants legs, black boots going up to her knees, and a red scarf around her neck.“Sorry I’m late. I wanted to wear this for training today. Like what you see?” Carol smirked.“Well, in a way, yeah I do” Peter decided to be honest with her but mentally slapped himself for saying that. ‘You idiot why did you say that?’“If I didn't know any better Peter I’d think you’re getting bold by admitting that. As it turns out”, Carol got closer to him and pressed her breasts on his chest, “I actually like that in a man”. This caused Peter to get nervous. “Alright this will be a one on one training exercise to see what you've learned. Get ready and come at me with what you've got”. With that both Peter and Carol started sparing with each other exchanging blow after blow with one another. After about fifteen minutes of sparing, Peter was able to flip Carol on to the floor on her back. Peter quickly got on top of her holding her arms behind her head to prevent her from moving despite the fact that she is physically stronger. “Got you”.“Nice job but it’s not over yet” Carol wrapped her legs around waist and flipped herself over with Peter on the bottom. “Now it’s over”, Carol teased.“How? I haven’t given up yet”. Peter struggled to get free.“Peter I’m going to be honest. I like you a lot”. Those words caught Peter off guard. Peter was more surprised when Carol kissed him. After about a few seconds Peter kissed her back. Both of their tongues fighting for dominance. Slowly they broke away. “I’m sorry but I can’t wait any longer”. Carol spun around towards his crotch and unzipped his pants revealing his hardened cock. Carol couldn't believe ho
