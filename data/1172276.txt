Chapter Text
Thor finds Loki beautiful all the time. Of course, he is beautiful in many different ways, and Thor delights in finding grace in the curve of Loki's smile, the bend of his waist, the arch of his eyebrows as he stares at Thor from across the room, a book lying forgotten on his lap and Modi cradled in the other arm.Beautiful underneath him, writhing and gasping and crying out for more and more and more. Insatiable.Beautiful on top of him, his knees digging into the mattress on either side of Thor's waist, his skin warm and slippery with sweat where Thor held him by the hips, his head tossed back and the graceful lines of his throat bobbing as he swallowed back moans and whimpers so that Modi wouldn't wake in the next room.Beautiful as he sits across from Thor at the breakfast table, bags under his eyes from a sleepless night of tending to the children in the nursery (Modi refused to go to sleep and stay asleep unless someone was there to rock him into dreams, and JÃ¶rmungandr wasn't exactly the best of playmates).But Thor thinks the most beautiful Loki has ever been is the moment in which he looks down at Thor on bended knee, a sheen of tears swimming in his green eyes, twin dimples appearing in the corners of his smiling mouth as he holds out his hand for Thor to slip the slender silver ring on, and says "Yes."
