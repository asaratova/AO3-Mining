“I don’t-” Peter swallowed, looking between his friends. “I don’t know what to do.” He took a deep, shuddering breath, staring at the wreckage in front of him. Bodies piled around blood-splattered streets. Ned’s hands were shaking, MJ’s pulling tightly on the draw strings of her hoodie.Harley’s eyes were wide, desperate. “It’s okay,” he said. “Just—do whatever you need to.”“I can’t!” Peter exclaimed. “I can’t save everyone—”“It’s okay,” MJ interrupted, soft. “It’s okay. Just, save him.”“What about you-”She looked at the war-torn streets; the enemies still piling up ahead of them, the one that stood over her body. MJ nodded once, her head held high with courage. “Save him.”Peter turned to Mr Stark, to his left, who’d been watching this with a keen gaze. “What’ll it be?”“I’m going to use my wand to cast cure wounds at third level on Aerelm,” he announced.Mr Stark nodded. “Alright, that’s your whole action, and you’ve run out of charges of that spell.”“I know.”Mr Stark leaned over the table, moving Harley’s Half Orc Fighter back to standing as Peter rolled a few d8s for healing. “Not bad, sixteen.”“It’ll do,” Harley agreed, flipping his pencil over to the eraser end and rubbing out the big fat zero he’d scrawled on his character sheet. He erased the death saving throws while he was at it.Mr Stark nodded. “Alright, with Cayde turning his attention to Aerelm, Finn’s been left wide open. The Cloud Giant, standing over Finn’s body, raises its Morningstar.”“No, no, no,” Ned whispered.MJ winced.“It brings down its weapon in a smooth arc, slamming it into Finn’s unconscious body.”MJ slumped forward in her seat, pressing her forehead against the table. One of the figures on the map wobbled and toppled into one of the dead bodies that were placed around the landscape to show the cost of the battle so far. Harley righted the figure with a frown.“I’m dead,” MJ muttered into the table.“Two fails on death saving throws when you’re already down,” Ned agreed.MJ breathed out, slow, pained. “I’m dead.”Peter placed a comforting hand on her back, grimacing as he looked back to the Finn figurine. The Aasimir was dead on the ground, in Peter’s mind he could see her, the Morningstar embedded in her stomach, wings lifeless, bow and arrow at her side, forgotten.For a moment, the image was replaced with May. Corpse strewn across the road, the car speeding off into the distance; blood running down from her nose, eyes unseeing, staring into the sky above. He wondered what her last thought had been.Peter blinked and it was Finn again. A Dungeons and Dragons character. MJ, who’d rolled her face until her cheek was pressed against the table top.“I’m sorry,” he said.“It’s okay,” she replied. “It was me or Aerelm, and Aerelm’s the key to saving the universe.”“We’ll avenge you,” Peter promised.MJ smiled something sad. “You’ve been hanging out with Iron Man too much.” * Peter wrapped the blanket tighter around his shoulders, squeezed between Ned and Harley on the sofa, MJ on Harley’s other side. The four of them were a bundle of blankets and cushions, most of which ironically Iron-and-Spider-Man themed. On the television, Brave played; rolling Scottish hillocks and a young woman with wild orange hair on horseback.Peter didn’t see any of it.He felt the familiar press of Ned’s arm against his, of Harley’s head on Peter’s shoulder; his knees pulled up to press against the tops of Peter’s thighs, feet most likely resting on MJ’s legs. But everything else; sounds, sights, smells, they were all secondary. Distant, difficult to grasp as Harley shifted, just slightly, and his dusty blonde hair brushed against Peter’s jaw.He would’ve been floating if it weren’t for the weights of Ned and Harley. Would’ve floated all the way out of his body and above the city, New York nothing but a smudge beneath him, space and its endless stars and nebulas welcoming him with open arms.Mr Stark hated space; hated what he’d seen on the other side of the wormhole. Hated the dangers of it, the emptiness. Peter was the opposite. Sometimes, he wanted nothing more than to explore it; to poke around Mars and Saturn, to bounce between planets and moons. He wanted to be a planet, be a star, burning up at extreme rates, be a black hole or a green dust cloud, an asteroid belt or a thousand pieces of broken satellite, spinning forever in the expanse.There was a lot of space out there, and Peter was half way there from his spot on the sofa.“Are you okay?” Harley whispered, pulling his head back from Peter’s shoulder. There was a crease between Harley’s brow, eyes filled with concern.Peter blinked, nodded. Then Harley pulled up the corner of a blanket, draped across them. He swiped it across Peter’s cheek. Peter frowned and touched the other side of his face, feeling the dampness there. He hadn’t known he’d been crying. * May Parker had died two weeks before.A car had hit her at a crosswalk, slamming into her side so forcefully that witnesses said she’d been thrown against
