Chapter Text
S.H.I.E.L.D. completely disregarded the threat.The UN didn’t. Following the Battle of New York, Tony had spoken of what he’d seen, and what was coming. S.H.I.E.L.D. had publically dismissed it, claiming the threat was dealt with. The public was more than willing to swallow that Tony Stark was just looking for more attention. But the public was not the UN.A week later, Tony was summoned to the UN board, to further explain what he had seen through the portal. At the hearing – entirely private – there was a dark-haired woman with a small entourage. She sat in silence with the others and listened to his testimony.When he was done, the chairman turned to her. ‘What do you make of this, Mrs. Singe?’Tony looked over. The woman stood up and walked down as she began speaking. ‘I find this entirely likely. The Chitauri are an army for hire and little more. You want to invade or destroy a civilisation and they’ll do it for a small fee. Whoever paid them is still out there – hasn’t even been touched. I would like a look at that sceptre, to be honest; see how it took control of someone’s mind. Unfortunately, S.H.I.E.L.D. has disappeared it to parts unknown.’‘So we are under threat of invasion?’ the chairman asked.‘Very much so.’ Mrs. Singe turned to him. ‘Mr. Stark, my name is Dani Singe. I head the Kaias Foundation. I am offering a cooperation to deal with the problem.’Turned out S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t know everything. The Kaias Foundation was known only to the British Royal Family and the United Nations. They were far more suited to dealing with alien invasion than S.H.I.E.L.D. ever was. Tony’s first clue to their true nature was in that the base was located at the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, sitting right on the ocean floor – and that was a marvel of engineering in itself.The second was the agents themselves.‘So you’re aliens yourselves?’ Tony watched a blue-skinned woman pass by as Dani Singe led him through the base.‘Yup,’ Dani said. ‘It was my idea, but I needed help setting it up. Everyone here is a refugee. Provided they just want to live their lives, they can join Kaias and that’s their employment and they’re left alone.’‘Like a work visa,’ Tony mused.‘Exactly like a work visa.’Tony nodded. He waited a moment, and then he asked the question that had been plaguing him since he realised the UN was listening. ‘Why did the UN believe me when S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t?’‘S.H.I.E.L.D.’s an intelligence agency that fancies itself Earth’s last line of defence against alien threat,’ Dani said.Tony scoffed. Fury hadn’t been very secretive about that belief. But then there was this place. It was made up of aliens who had come from out there, and knew what was out there; what was a threat and what wasn’t. They knew the technology, they knew the varieties of species. This was Earth’s last line of defence.Dani’s lips tugged upwards in a smirk. ‘In ’69, the UN formed their own alien defence taskforce, which we often work with: the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. UNIT. They had two advantages over S.H.I.E.L.D. One: they had branches in every UN country. Two: one of their chief scientific advisors was an alien himself. The same man who raised me – which is how I got in. One thing he always told me: humans have an unmatched capacity for self-delusion.’Tony lifted his eyebrows. ‘Self-delusion?’‘Humans like to feel safe,’ Dani said, leading him through a door and down a corridor. ‘If they can’t do that, they act like a bunch of paranoid schitzes, like how they treat Dr. Banner. It’s a big part of why Kaias is secret. Humans, as a general rule of thumb, will ignore threats they can’t see. The UN is aware of the fact that there are over two hundred invasion attempts on the Earth every year.’‘That many?’ Tony asked. ‘And Kaias and UNIT are the ones that deal with it?’‘Yeah, we let S.H.I.E.L.D. have some from time-to-time. For instance, they can keep the Asgardians.’ There was a little quirk to her lips.‘I take it Thor and his bunch aren’t that highly regarded in this neck of the woods,’ Tony said, a little amused at the idea. Thor had seemed like little more than a big kid to him. Sure, Tony acted irresponsible, but it’d been a while since he really was. Thor had also given off the air of someone who thought he was superior to all those around him – specifically, the humans.‘Well, look around. Why would they be? Their society hasn’t budged an inch in 2000 years.’ Dani chuckled. ‘Yet they insist they’re the most superior race in all nine realms. They’re a laughing stock to us.’‘What about the super strength?’ Tony asked.‘One of the most common advantages people get,’ Dani said. ‘It’s very basic to be honest. I’ve got it, Sark’s got it. About 85% of his division have it.’‘So it’s no big deal?’ Tony asked.‘No, it’s more or less something that pops up every now and again, like red hair.’ As Dani passed someone,
