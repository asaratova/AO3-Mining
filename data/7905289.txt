Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Here’s the thing about Steve Rogers. At heart, he is not a vain man. He does not Google himself, search out for movies about his person, look for biographies, or any of the other hundred pieces of media made about him. He has no desire to see them in any way, shape, or form. He’s made it pretty clear to his friends, co-workers, teammates, casual acquaintances, random passers-by, reporters, and even the occasional pigeon that would rest on his windowsill in DC that he is just not interested. As stated before, it feels vain. Steve Rogers has faults, but vanity has never been a large one. Anything for him to be vain about, to paraphrase an angry Tony Stark, came out of a bottle in the 40s. Being awake in the 21st century for a few years now, he’s pretty much figured out the way people perceived him. CAPTAIN AMERICA! He’s the stalwart and true hero. Don’t forget to put a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun. He doesn’t curse, doesn’t get angry, and doesn’t have a bad day. Captain America is no less than perfect. He is whatever you want him to be, unless you are of course wrong about who he is. Then Captain America will shame you forever. There are several hundred million people in the United States, and they each have their own idea about who their icon should be. Steve Rogers is just the poor bastard who has to shoulder a legacy that outgrew him as he slept in the ice. He was the American Arthurian Myth: their Once and Future King. Steve had a feeling that none of the media, none of the people really got who the man was underneath the myth. After all, Steve Rogers was meant to be a cog in the machine. It’s like a Rule amongst the Avengers: do not show Steve stuff based on himself. Not even for humor purposes. Like Natasha threatened Tony with harm if he ever tried to make them watch one of the movies during movie night. She even got JARVIS in on the conspiracy somehow because nothing remotely related to Steve’s pop culture influence will show up in the Tower or the systems at all. Steve may be playing pop culture catch-up, but he still is fairly ignorant on current-current pop culture. The emergencies of the Avengers, the search for Bucky, and trying to smoke out HYDRA takes up a ton of his time. So, ironically, he really is the last to know about the phenomena. It actually takes him a stupidly, embarrassingly long time to learn of the musical that literally sweeps the nation. Whoops. So the real question is… 
How does a half-dead orphan born in the middle of a forgotten spot in the tenements of New York without a father and raised by a single mother grow up to be the first and only super soldier?

Steve Rogers: The Kid From Brooklyn is an absolutely massive beast of a biography. It clocks in at around eight hundred some pages, and could probably killed a man if struck with enough force in the right spot. (Actually, in one instance, when the Black Widow was posing as a college student the book was used to kill an enemy agent. But that’s a story for another day.) The book was written by one Robert Barnes-Proctor, son of Rebecca Barnes-Proctor who was the sister of James Buchanan Barnes. A few years younger than her older brother, Mrs. Barnes-Proctor would grow up to become a huge proponent of feminist and veteran causes. She has tried to sue people for the wrongful depiction of Bucky Barnes as a teenage sidekick. That didn’t exactly work. Becca has also been banned from FOX News along with her son. It’s a point of family pride. Along with flipping the bird at the heroic stoic not at all Steve and Bucky statue that depicts them as humorless prigs rather than the people they were. (Steve Rogers feelings on this would be a huge sigh and a quiet “Really?” that accurately conveyed his disdain.) Broo
