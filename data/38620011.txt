She smiled at me, the way she would smile at any stranger.That first night we met, she proved to be incredibly adept at charming people she didn't know. That smile was big and charismatic, I would love to think she was treating me special from the first time she saw me, but I came to understand she was like this all the time.I remember listening to Flash's increasingly confused questions as to how Peter knew someone like her while she got really close to me and Harry. Physically close, I mean. Her face was inches from mine, her expression was otherworldly. "You must be Gwendolyn." She whispered into my ear. That was the closest I ever got to Mary Jane Watson. Emotionally, she went on to keep me an arms length away. Her behavior, and the way she talked, was sometimes so bizarre that it became obvious that she was a miserably insincere person, she even called herself an 'actress' despite being a waitress. Her insincerity didn't seem to matter to men however. Maybe they didnâ€™t notice, maybe they thought every woman was like that.That's hypocritical of me, I'm not any better.I fell in love with the character she played just the same as any man would.I did try to do better once, it was a late summer night, we were under a full moon that was obscured by clouds and I told her - "I want to know you better." She leaned in to me again, physically close, "No you don't." She smiled at me, the way she would smile at any stranger.
