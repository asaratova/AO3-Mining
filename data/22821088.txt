Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter woke up that morning to the feeling of soft breaths on the back of his neck and strong muscled arms wrapped around his chest cocooning him in a sense of love and warmth. He opened his eyes just as his boyfriend of three years gently laid kisses upon his morning curls.“G’morning sweetheart”, spoke a raspy southern drawl which made Peter’s heart flutter every time.“Morning Harls”, replied Peter slowly turning around in the sheets to face his gorgeous cowboy with the biggest heart eyes known to mankind, but it was okay because Harley’s face held the exact same expression, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.The two of them took their time getting out of bed and then not so gracefully clambering into the shower together after a few suggestive touches and a raise of eyebrows from the smaller (Peter was very salty about Harley being a whole three inches taller than him, yet then again it just made Harley’s hoodies even comfier if he was honest, but it’s not like he would willingly admit that out loud).After their combined shower Peter and Harley noticing the time threw on some random clothes they found on the floor from the previous day, Peter not looking to see if the clothes were even his, and rushed to the kitchen for breakfast. Nat was already lounging on a bar stool with her coffee, while Bucky was talking to Steve and Wanda about some issues he was having with his new vibranium arm made curtesy of Princess Shuri of Wakanda, aka Peter’s badass bitch boi.The four Avengers said their good mornings as the couple sat at the table after each pouring bowls of cereal. Just as Peter began to eat Tony entered the room with his usual bold presence filling the air without even needing to speak a word.“Morning Dad”, Peter spoke with a mouthful of cheerios. Harley laughed as Tony grimaced and playfully slapped Peter of the back of the head.“That’s nasty you little shi-”, Tony held his tongue as Pepper entered the room and gave a disapproving look, she had been trying to make Tony swear less as Morgan was starting to pick up on some of his bad language and the last thing Pepper wanted was for her angel was to swear like a sailor before even reaching high school. “Not sure what you’re laughing at problem child” Tony grumbled as he whacked Harley over the back of the head making him cough and spit out his cereal.Peter snorted as Friday spoke up, “Peter if you don’t want to be late for school you’ll need to get moving” in her Irish accent.“Oh damn- nO. I mean oh no”, Peter commented just as Pepper’s head whipped up. Peter quickly kissed Harley before standing and sprinting to get his bag from their room.“See ya later guys!”, Peter shouted through to the kitchen on his way to the elevator hearing responses of ‘have a good day’ and a distinct “love you babe!” shouting back his own “love you too Harls!”.

 Peter was so incredibly tired by 8th period, he was struggling to stay awake with his eyes drooping every ten seconds. He was wide awake though when Ned started to slap his arm with vigorous intent clearly excited about something he’d missed in his internal fight against falling asleep.“Can you believe it?! I can’t wait ohmygod oHmy-” Ned squealed, Peter confused and still trying to catch up looked over at MJ who was sat on the other side of Ned. She was just smirking with a knowing look on her face as if she wasn’t going to let on to anything. How helpful.Looking around the room trying to grasp what everyone was so excited about his eyes accidentally landed on Flash who coincidently was staring right at him with such a smug expression Peter was genuinely concerned for him cause that shit needed a priest, Jesus.“Yo Penis. I cannot wait for this trip to prove that you’ve been lying and that your internship is as fake as the rumours that Tony “playboy” Stark has a kid”, Flash spoke maliciously.First of all, Peter thought, you don’t know how wrong you are you absolute dipshit.He didn’t say that out loud though because he didn’t fancy a detention and one of Mr Harrison’s disappointed looks, mostly because he just looked like a sad puppy and that made Peter feel bad. So instead he chose to ignore his bully and figure out what he even meant by that comment.“Ned, what are you on about where is the trip?”Ned gave him a another excited expression “We’re going to Stark Industries Peter!!”.Just like that he thought he was going into cardiac arrest. His entire class was going on a trip to basically his house, the avengers where totally going to embarrass the fuck outa him and they will all find out that Tony and Pepper Stark are his adopted parents (they adopted him after May died two years ago).  Worst case scenario everyone was going to find out he was Spider-Man and he would have to make a public statement and move to Peru or Tony could threaten his lawyers but he was certain someone would slip up anyway. To Harley <3: Babe im quaking I need he lpFrom Harley <3: What’s wrong darling??To
