 Tony Stark is a marvel. Fact. He revolutionized the world for fun, and everything he’s done since he was four years old when he made his own circuit board to the day he’d eventually grace the world with his AI-holograph to guide the future geniuses of the world, Tony Stark would continue to be a goddamn marvel.Until that day came, Tony Stark would also continue to be a goddamn idiot.After all, no normal person, when faced with someone who’s tried to kill them, sighs dramatically and complains, “Pete, I swear to god, I just sent you out for milk.”Bucky knows he wasn’t in the best shape but come on.He’d been spotted waist-deep in a scrap heap trying to find a spare part for his arm before he was subsequently dragged into Stark Tower by the Spider kid (“Peter, my name’s Peter!”) in all his nearly-but-close-to-homeless glory.He looked pathetic, Bucky knew it, but he still had the Hydra arm - a compromise during his brief stay in Wakanda during talks of his pardon - and he was still the world’s deadliest living assassin.Tony Stark, and all who knew him should know better.Instead, the kid, Peter, continued to babble on about how Tony’s gonna lose it! and then adding, You’re looking a little thin and Oh dude, when was the last time you showered?Which – rude.None of his life after breaking free of Hydra’s control had gone to plan. However flimsy the plan had been.Granted, in the end, it had worked out for the best.Bucky hadn’t signed the Accords, preferring to retire, and was promptly returned to the United States at his request (anything to get away from that psychotic witch Steve was convinced was just a kid).Steve, on the other hand, refused to sign, as did the rest of the Rogues out of pure spite against Tony. Bucky didn’t miss them, and he was grateful he didn’t have the means to communicate with them because he’d honestly stick pins in his eyes than have to go through the whole song and dance of “I’m Bucky, but not your Bucky” again for the millionth time.At the very least, distancing himself from Steve’s patriotic shadow helped Bucky find some anonymity, a great help in avoiding getting run out of Tony’s city. Not just because of the role Bucky played in the dissolution of the original Earth's Mightiest Heroes line-up, but also because of his tumultuous history with the billionaire which guaranteed that this meeting would go to the shitter and thereafter find Bucky in the midst of getting run out of town.The kid dragging him to Tony’s doorstep would certainly help make that a reality. Evidently, “spidey senses” were only in effect when Peter was the one in danger, go figure.Instead, a month later found Bucky’s putting an “Arc Reactor” nightlight in the online cart of Tony’s shopping account because Friday’s got jokes, and Bucky knows Tony would find it funny which –Clearly means both he and Tony have “being idiots” in common, even if that conversation had gone like this:“You realize I could murder you, right?”“He says as he angrily grates cheese."Making Bucky snap, “You need your calcium,” you know, like an idiot.“Says the guy with the metal arm,” Tony retorted, clearly in the know about the state of Bucky’s intelligence.“Don’t make me add spinach to this,” Bucky warned still very idiot-like, though at least that had gotten the so-called genius to shut up and start pouting which, apparently is the level of danger Bucky possessed. Even the boys, Peter, his best friend, Ned and another boy, Harley, hadn’t even worked up the nerve to fake a tremble when Bucky scowled at Tony’s attempt to give him the puppy eyes.“You’re adorable, and all this cooking you’ve taken to doing makes you my own personal Gordon Ramsey. Except hotter and Russian,” Tony declared with a wiggle of his brows. 
Unbelievable.
“I have a reputation,” Bucky grunted to himself.Tony hummed, “Forgive me for not cowering at the feet of the guy who makes smiley-faces out of pancakes and bacon.”“Harley said you wouldn’t eat it if it didn’t smile at you.”He wanted to brain himself on the kitchen counter when he heard the tell-tale smack of Harley, Ned and Peter high fiving over their homework.Tony, on the other hand, cooed.Bucky huffed, repeating firmly (more to himself than anyone else at this point), “I could murder you.”“Of course, you could, kitten,” Tony soothed, sounding completely trusting to the fact that Bucky wouldn’t which was stupid of him, but also true. Even though it had only been a week, Bucky would rather stick his flesh arm into the trash compactor than even be responsible for giving Tony anything more severe than a papercut.Though, that didn’t mean that Bucky was beyond hurting Tony in other ways if it meant it was for his own good. In Tony’s defense, Bucky had asked.“When was the last time you even slept?”Tony paused, and had to honest to god think about it, before replying, “I had a really long blink yesterday.”Friday intoned flatly, “We’re all very proud” which meant that Tony’s youngest had definitely reached the end o
