Chapter 1: The Beginning of the End
    




Chapter Text
Tony was the first to reach her side.Despite the fact that both Clint and Wanda were closer to Natasha, neither of them made an effort to go to her.Clint, for all his training and skills was looking down at Natasha's crumpled form, eyes unfocused and body completely stiff, seemingly uncaring of the fact that his best friend was in the process of bleeding out at his feet, and Wanda... Wanda had the same stricken expression as everyone else painted on her face, the implications of what she'd done, of who she'd done it to, making her reach both hands up to cover the sobs that were threatening to spill forth from her thin mouth.Tony had never felt more afraid, throwing himself to his knees, he gently cradled Natasha's form to him, mindful of the warnings that Friday was murmuring into his ear. Removing the armor's face plate off with trembling fingers, he felt more than saw, the bright red streaks of blood it left on his skin.He could feel his breath beginning to leave him in short, choppy pants and he forced himself to breathe, now was not the time for a fucking panic attack. Natasha's prone form was still oozing red, a shade so much brighter than her hair and Tony didn't understand any of it all.He had seen the moment when Black Widow was engaged in combat with Hawkeye, her face open and teasing, both of them knowing they had chosen their sides in this, and understanding where it left the other.Black Panther and War Machine reached him as the emergency helicopter Friday had ordered came down, T’Challa gripping Tony’s encased hand tightly, unable to connect with him in the way he wished to because of their respective suits.Tony clenched his eyes, not wanting to see as the personnel efficiently hooked up Widow to various monitors and I.V. fluids, her suit completely drenched in a myriad of black and red.They had pressed gauzes to the gaping hole that had tried to rip her in half, (faces carefully blank, but eyes telling another story,) the hole that was caused by the jagged piece of metal that Wanda had impaled her on.Tony swallowed the bile back, making a conscious effort to calm himself, it wouldn't do to let the bittersweet scent of fear and anger reach T'Challa or Rhodey, he didn't want to be a weak Omega, one who needed the support of an Alpha to calm him down, and he didn't want to make the situation any more volatile than it currently was.Tensions were high enough already, and Tony didn't want to burn through the scent blockers any quicker than he had to.Tony felt Wanda's distress as she was gathered into Barton's arms, the Alpha soothing the Omega as best as he could, (and why, why, why was he comforting her?)His scent mixed with hers in such a putrid way that it made Tony's stomach roil in disgust. Not for the first time in his life, Tony stared into Wanda's cold, empty eyes and wished that magic didn't exist.~In the aftermath of it all, Tony learned that Captain America and Barnes had escaped.Peter, God bless the kid, had done his best to stop them, but Scott Lang had intercepted and swatted him out of the way, knocking the boy out. Thankfully, other than a few scrapes and bruises, Peter was alright, Tony didn't know what he would've done with himself if the kid had gotten seriously injured.The flight back to Avengers Headquarters was a quiet one, the kid's face was tearful and he gnawed at his lower lip, not willing to meet Tony's eyes. Tony could feel distress and guilt rolling off of him in waves, and Tony, who had never been good at offering any form of comfort, couldn't begrudge the kid when he curled into his side, hazel eyes meeting his meekly, as though expecting a reprimand of some sort.Tony put his arm around the kid's scrawny frame and brought him closer, his scent helping in calming him down some, his nature already beginning to identify the boy as part of him, a part of his pack. He eyed the setting sky as Peter dozed off, thoughts running in every direction.T'Challa and Vision had helped escort Wanda, Clint, Scott and Sam off to be interrogated by Ross. Rhodey had flown ahead and made sure Dr. Cho had everything she would require in order to treat Natasha. 


~It should have never come to this. Whatever issues Steve fucking Rogers had with him and with the Accords, didn't justify what had occurred in the airport. Tony hadn't expected to see Clint, or Wanda there.Clint, for one, was supposed to be enjoying his vacation time with his family, far away from the mess that Captain America and the witch had inadvertently caused.Wanda was to be staying at Avengers Headquarters, away from anything that could continue painting her in a bad light to the public, while Tony worked on getting her pardoned and hopefully trained under Charles' guidance.Wanda had already proven to them before that her powers were beyond even her control, she let her emotions control her and today it had nearly cost Natasha her life. Tony didn't even know who the he
