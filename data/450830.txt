There were hostiles in the Tower. It ran as a dull chant in the back of Clint’s head, a steady, metronome beat, matching rhythm with his heartbeat, his breathing, the flex of his arms as he drew down. It hummed through him, unobtrusive, undemanding, a simple, rational summary of the situation.There were hostiles in the Tower. Steve and Thor were two floors above, Thor basically on Hulk-containment duty, Steve at the conn (fucking Stark, the man was paranoid like you wouldn’t believe, the whole Tower was fed into a surveillance console in his penthouse) relaying positions to Clint and Natasha. Natasha … Clint had no idea, but there wasn’t a lot of time between the targets Steve was shooting her, so he was guessing she was wherever most of the enemy were, and they were getting significantly less in number the longer that situation continued.And Tony himself … well. That was where Clint came in. Because apparently Stark had gotten himself pinned down in one of his workshops. Not one of the ones containing armours. Also apparently, the remote controlled armour was several floors and a not-inconsiderable amount of structural damage away from said workshop. And, to round the evening out, apparently the hostiles had somehow managed to deliberately arrange for this to be the case, because Stark’s pet AI had informed Steve in rapid order that, based on the clustering, he believed that the bulk of the enemy forces were to distract the other Avengers long enough for a surgical extraction, of Stark, from said workshop.All of which pointed to something Clint was carefully not thinking about, something Clint shoved clinically under the steady metronome chant in his head, something he wasn’t going to think about until after the situation was contained.Someone had given them that information. Someone had let them in. Someone, somewhere, in Stark/Avengers Tower, had opened the door to the enemy.Someone, he thought, who had better make sure they were also surgically extracted before this night was out, or they would have a small infinity of time over which to regret it.“Clint, what’s your ETA?” Steve’s voice came through, strained and aggravated. Steve had wanted to be hunting, too. JARVIS, for some reason none of them were sure of, had informed them that he would be incapable of adequately maintaining the conn, and advised that someone should stay at the helm. Steve, reluctantly, had agreed. But he obviously wasn’t happy about it.“Two minutes away,” Clint said back, busy unclipping himself from harness. Elevator shafts were handy for quick floor access, but the Tower ventilation, in credit to Stark’s paranoia, wasn’t near big enough to support entry. He’d have to go in the hard way. “Something wrong?”“JARVIS has cut off contact,” Steve said. Clipped and brief, rigidly controlled, but Clint felt the stagger in his gut regardless. “Something’s happening in that workshop, Clint. You need to be there yesterday.”“No kidding,” Clint murmured. A little raggedly around the edges, his hands already in motion, his mind dropping back to that cold, clean beat. Scanning the environment, plotting arcs and trajectories and equipment deployment. He was trotting along the corridor, short bow at the ready and bolt in hand, before Steve had even finished talking.If JARVIS was out, then someone was in. Someone with Stark, someone holding him, armourless and defenceless, not half a floor and some reinforced walls away from Clint.Fine then. Showtime, boys and girls.The workshop, which was actually still a floor below him, had an overlook balcony accessed from this floor. This was one of the main testing floors, and Stark had installed a number of glass-fronted (‘glass’ being something of a misnomer, but Stark had flat-out refused to call it ‘transparent aluminum’ when it had nothing to do with aluminum at all, keep your crappy sci-fi references to yourself, Barton) viewing galleries above some of the labs. At Clint and Natasha’s insistence, he’d also added in hatches, concealed at various places along the lengths, from which viewers (ie teammates) could access the testing floors from the galleries.And it was from one of those galleries that he got his first look at the situation down in the workshop.It wasn’t pretty. Stark had apparently managed to disable two of his opponents, one with what looked like a heavy-duty machine wrench, the other with the partially-cannibalised repulsor gauntlet he’d apparently found the time to stick onto his left hand and clumsily wire into the reactor. He must have been behind cover doing it, because there were any number of bullet-holes and ricochet marks scattered around the workshop.There were also four other hostiles, all extremely angry looking, gathering in a loose, gun-pointing circle around where Stark was crouched, out in the fucking open, over the downed shape of one of his robots. The weird ones, with the arms, and the incredible kicked-puppy looks. Stark, his face and the back of one shoulder
