Bucky was off doing Bucky things — hunting Hydra, dodging Steve, terrifying villagers — and Darcy knew how to pick a lock. Looking around Bucky's shithole apartment, empty now of his old, gross, found-in-a-dumpster furniture, Darcy surveyed her work with satisfaction. There were new cabinets along the wall that made up the kitchen, a new adorably studio-sized refrigerator, new equally adorable stove, and on the other side of the room a real door to the bathroom, hiding the new, not skin-crawlingly vile shower, sink, and toilet. She grinned at the stained, yellowing, putty-colored walls. Her next conquest. Despite her best efforts, Bucky refused to move until they found a place in Brooklyn for their bar; his plan was that the building should be multi-story, with apartments on the upper floors. Bucky was really big into dreaming, and she didn't have the heart to tell him he was high, God knew it was probably the first dream he'd let himself have in more than seventy years. Phil, wrapped up in a million other things going wrong, gave them his sort of blessing (he'd sighed and said "you're going to do it anyway, aren't you? Just try and be subtle. At least a little bit?") and access to a portion of the funds they'd stolen from Hydra. Still, even with the shaky bar/base plan given a go, they hadn't gotten very far in the search for a building yet, and God only knew when they'd find it, because Bucky also got mopey if she went and looked at buildings without him. That left her stuck in this whole useless, treading water thing while he was gone. But, as she'd warned him once, she'd been to Home Depot a time or twelve, and if she couldn't hunt real estate, she could make a move on the real estate she did have access to. A little extra cash to the manager of Bucky's building, who assured her the landlord would be plenty grateful to have somebody fix the place up on their own dime, kept him out of her hair. A phone call to a local construction company brought some men out for a couple days to refinish the floors, and tear out the old cabinets, appliances, and scary bathroom fixtures and replace them with new. Then, with an SUV purloined from the SI/Avengers motorpool, Darcy went out and hit a half dozen furniture stores and the Home Depot. Taking into consideration Bucky's obvious preference for an ascetic life, she'd gone easy on the furnishings. A murphy bed with a narrow wardrobe on one side (his clothes, the few he had, were currently packed into a pair of plastic milk crates he'd probably picked up in an alley somewhere — he was killing her with this), a couch that didn't smell like feet and stale cigarette smoke, a small coffee table (just the right size for him to stash his weapons trunk underneath — she'd measured), and a small dining table with a pair of simple chairs. It was all in dark woods and brushed nickel so he wouldn't have his brooding interrupted by any bright, cheery colors. The biggest challenge was restraining herself and not picking up any actual décor items beyond a couple floor lamps and blinds for the windows, though she did get him new sheets and towels and, frankly, he was just going to have to learn to live with some tiny creature comforts. It truly hurt her deep inside, that after everything he'd been through, Bucky chose to live in a dark, dingy hole.The apartment space itself really wasn't bad. It was a small studio, but it had a simple plan that could be nice enough — hell, just a little closer to midtown and this place would go for three grand a month easy. And while it wasn't the best in the world, the building was hardly a slum. From the people she'd seen going in and out, a lot them were her age or a little younger — college students or young professionals just starting out. The place was half dorm. And, sure, overall the building could use some work, better lighting in the halls, new linoleum on the floors, but it wasn't horrible. Which is really what made his apartment so very extra depressing.Slapping her palms together, she rubbed her hands, pleased with her planning and with the thought of the look of shock and irritation on Bucky's face when he walked in. Was she over-stepping? Maybe a tiny bit. But, she really had warned him, and if he was going to badger her about the bar, she was going to go to town on his place. Now, she had a day to paint before the furniture was delivered. She'd thought about hiring somebody, but for part of this little makeover it somehow felt important that she use her own hands, her own effort (beyond shopping). It would be all the more satisfying when Bucky asked, "what the hell did you do to my place?" and she could legitimately claim that she, yes she, had an actual hand in it. Once she'd cleaned, scrubbed, and sanded down the walls, she clomped back down to the SUV to get the paint supplies. Tarp and roller tucked under one arm, and in the other hand a bag with brushes and other supplies, she stepped back up onto the sidewalk and turne
