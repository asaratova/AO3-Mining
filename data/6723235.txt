Chapter Text
“Steve doesn't hate you,” Wanda says softly. “It's been a week, Wanda.” The two of you sway against your seats at the back of the quinjet as Natasha brings you around for a landing. “You said the date went well,” Wanda pats your hand. “He's not going to be happy on your date and then hate you a week later.” “I could've been wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.” You glance up to where Steve is sitting in the copilot's seat. “He hasn't said more than five consecutive words to me since we left for the mission.” “Maybe it's just mission fatigue.” You feel Wanda extend a brush of calm against your mind and give her a small smile of thanks. “He's seemed normal with everyone else. Just not me.” You shake your head. “Maybe he doesn’t think team members should date after all.” “He doesn't seem to mind Clint and Natasha.” “I don't think they would care if he did. They're kind of stubborn like that.” “True.” She cocks her head to the side thoughtfully, then shrugs. “The only way you're going to find out is if you talk to him.” “I will. As soon as I think I can face down the mortification.” You look back at Steve once more and feel a blush heat your cheeks when you meet his eyes. Neither of you move for a moment. Then you give him a small smile. He blinks once and turns back to the control panel in front of him. “We're coming in to land,” his voice comes over the team's earpieces and more than one person sighs with relief. Long missions weren't that common and you were all ready to unwind after a week in the field. “Talk to him,” Wanda murmurs. You give her a dry look and she shrugs. The doors open behind her and the two of you step out as soon as the quinjet touches down. Pietro speeds past you in a cold rush of wind, then he and Wanda are gone. “Home sweet home,” Clint gives you a grin as he trudges past, quiver dangling from one hand. Natasha comes up on your right and slings an arm around Clint's waist, then gives you a nod of farewell. You can't help the ripple of jealousy that turns your stomach as you watch them go. It’s not Clint you want. Or Natasha. It’s the ease they feel when they reach for one another. “Y/N, can you return to the jet?” Steve's voice in your ear makes you cringe. You sigh and squeeze your eyes shut, your heart suddenly racing in your chest. The rest of the team moves into the tower without looking back and you hope that Steve at least had the courtesy to use your private channel for the call back. You didn't want them to share in the shame that you were about to feel. Steve is the only one in the jet when you step back on board. He leans against the back of the copilot's chair and you squash an aggressive appreciation for the way his arms look when he crosses them over his chest. “You called, Cap?” You stop a few feet away and cross your arms over your chest, mirroring him without meaning to. For a moment you think you might throw up as a small wave of panic laps at the back of your brain. Wanda might be able to read minds, but even she didn't know how much you feared the disdain of someone you cared about. Especially someone you care about as much as you care about Steve. “You did well this week, on the mission,” he says. His eyes glitter in the cabin lights and you nod as you take a deep breath to calm your nerves. Still, it’s hard to ignore his twinkling baby blues. “Thank you.” You shift your weight from foot to foot as silence grows between you. Steve shifts his position and clears his throat. “Things are... strange... between us right now,” he begins. You give a small nod and drop your gaze to his boots, hoping you don't cry. “I don't know what happened, but I want to fix it.” A humorless laugh of surprise slips out of your mouth and you bite your lower lip to keep another one from following. “I don't know what happened either,” you say as you look up at him. “You asked me to dinner and then stop talking to me. Did I... did I do something?” Surprise crosses Steve's face before a frown settles in place. “I didn't stop talking to you, ,” he says. “You seemed tense and I thought maybe you regretted the date. So I gave you space.” “I wasn't tense until you started using 'five words or fewer' as the rule when you talked to me,” you say. “We've been in the field a week and you managed to find time to chat with nearly everyone else. But the couple of times I tried to talk to you, you found somewhere else to be.” “I thought,” Steve trails off and shakes his head. “I don't know what I thought. Maybe that you wanted to let me down gently, or that whatever this is,” he waves a hand through the space between the two of you, “didn't belong on a mission.” “So you... you don't regret the date?” It rings hollow, but it's the only thing you can think to say. “God, no.” Steve snorts a small laugh and sha
