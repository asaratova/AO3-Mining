Chapter Text
SHIELD fell on a beautiful spring day in the year 2014. Anyone tuned in to media outlets or on the internet was pretty much glued to the coverage and the data that had been leaked. Shocks from the fall rippled across the world. People within SHIELD itself found themselves fighting for their lives, struggling to understand who was with them and who against.  A few SHIELD bases and facilities stayed secure, but due to the element of surprise, most fell to Hydra and most SHIELD agents scattered to other agencies, or into the private sector.  Hydra personnel, unlike those truly dedicated to SHIELD, had known that a time might come when Hydra’s continued existence was forced into the light of day.  They planned accordingly.
	When Darcy Lewis turned on her phone for the first time in three days, the text alarm sounded and she cursed as she saw that the most recent messages were from Ian, trying to make up with her after their last ‘fucking-fight.’  She was done with him. Why wouldn't he take ‘go fuck yourself’ as an answer?  She had totally unplugged, and sulked her way through the past few days, alternating between watching DVD rom-coms and action flicks while binging Chinese food and ice cream, completely cutting herself off from the world while she hit the reset button on her feelings.  Yesterday, she began to realize that she was mostly upset that she hadn't found the right guy yet, less so that things had gone south with Ian.  She’d spent the day reviewing her dating history in its sad lack of glory, despairing of ever finding the right guy.  Today, she woke and decided to write Ian off completely, and get on with her life.  And now he was sending her messages desperately begging her to get back together with him, acting like he thought her world had ended or something.  Terrified?  Why would he think she was terrified now? As if!  She put her foot down on the gas angrily as the signal light changed and she continued on her way to visit Erik.
	She had finished her classes at Oxford.  She could now go anywhere she wanted. One of the best things about never knowing where she’d live next was the ability to get away from things that had gone sour, like stupid dating choices.  Okay, so Ian had saved her from being vaporized by Dark Elves… that didn't mean she owed him the kisses she’d laid on him.  It definitely didn't mean she owed him anything more.  
	She put her phone in her pocket without looking at any of the other messages or feeds that had piled up, totally unwilling to die to text with her newly-ex.  She pulled into the car park of Erik’s latest funny farm, found a spot as close to the door as she could, and got out... balancing Erik’s home-brewed hot chocolate and her coffee while tucking a few scientific journals under her arm to take inside for him.  She usually would have gotten a newspaper so they could do puzzles together, but that errand would have taken her near Ian’s place, so she skipped it.  Her sparkling company and razor wit would have to do the cheer-up trick today.
	Poor Erik!  After that psycho Loki was through with him, he’d gone off the deep end in spectacular fashion.  While his last naked rant made for great TV, it did little to convince people of his sanity.  Darcy and Ian helped him ‘escape’ one crazy hospital to help against the Dark Elves (and thank the gods for that!), but couldn't care for him long-term after that.  No one could really go from taking EVERY med out there to none, no matter how brilliant they were.  For now, he was being looked after by the good old jack-booted thugs of SHIELD, and trying to sort out exactly which of his meds were helpful and which were not.  Few Docs had experience in post-god-possession psychiatric care.  She and Jane wanted to provide for him, but psychiatric care and meds cost money, and science didn't bring enough of it in... and Jane was off with Thor, no doubt in a bed somewhere crying out his name again and again.  She wondered where Jane and Thor would decide to live when they were done with their extended shag-fest vacation.  
	Darcy was still bummed that she hadn't gotten to go to Asgard, if only to taze Odin when he called Jane a goat.  Could Odin be tazed?  For that matter, would a Taser affect Thor now that he was all godly again?  She shook her head, laughing to herself as she wished she could taze Loki, the dead son-of-a-bitch --- Whoops!  Sorry, dead Frigga!  Oh, wait, it was okay.  She could curse Loki’s biological mom without getting lightning struck.  His bio-mom was a frost giantess, or something?  Darcy pushed thoughts of tazing assorted Asgardians and other space deities from her mind and entered the SHIELD hospital.
	She slowed as she reached the desk, signed in, and flashed her ID as usual, noting that some of the people working there looked unfamiliar.  She smiled at them anyway, hoping that the wary feeling she had inside didn'
