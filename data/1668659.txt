Before:
The whole debacle could arguably have started here: Clark wrote an article on Tony for the Daily Planet right after Tony’s disastrous birthday party. It was…unflattering, at best.Bruce didn’t speak to him for a week. “Would you just tell the JLA, already?” Dick asked. “You’ve trusted them this far, why not just go the full mile? It’d make this kind of stuff way easier, and Clark might actually apologise.”“I don’t need his apology,” Bruce replied, ignoring both Alfred and Dick in favour of buttering his toast very precisely. “I need leverage so I can buy up Hammer’s company and turn it into a waste disposal unit, which is the only thing it deserves to be.”“Stark seems to be doing all right on that front all on his own.”“You haven’t seen anything yet,” Bruce said darkly. “Tony doesn’t do anything by halves.”Several weeks later, with the Stark Expo nothing more than a charred disaster area, Dick raised an eyebrow. “I might see your point,” he conceded. “I might even be inclined to take Clark’s side on this one.”Bruce sighs. “I’ll let you meet him some time,” he says. “We’ll see what you think then.”  
Later:
(Dick meeting Tony is a mistake of the highest order.Bruce may have seen it coming…and done nothing to stop it.It’s worth it, though, for Dick’s look of sheer glee as he outruns, jumps, and dodges DUM-E’s clumsy flailing of the fire extinguisher, while Tony laughs and laughs from his workbench.“I like this kid,” Tony declares. “You should get some more. Responsibility looks good on you, as always.”“I’ll think about it,” Bruce replies, and allows his expression to remain soft as Dick whoops and does a backflip off of DUM-E’s arm. He acknowledges, if only to himself, how nice it is to have more than a select few people know the whole of him.)  
Before:
This was also, of course, how this whole situation started spiralling.  
Later:
Tony likes to think that he infected Bruce with the terrible breakfast protein shake craze. Bruce says precisely the reverse. Everyone agrees that it doesn’t matter; either possibility results in both of them having a disgusting habit. The first time Bruce stays the night in the Avengers mansion, Natasha looks at him the next day like all her worst nightmares had come true.“You actually drink those?”Bruce pauses halfway through swallowing down the whole magic bullet-full of green glop. “They’re good for you.”She throws up her hands. “You rich boys and your cleanses.”Bruce watches her leave the room, and says belatedly and somewhat affronted, “I don’t need to cleanse.”“Ooh, is there more of that?” Tony says, shuffling in like a zombie, hair in complete chaos.“No, but the ingredients are still out.”“Awesome.”None of the Avengers, save Tony, knows what Bruce does in his spare time. He kind of likes that they like him anyway, which is probably due to his inability to keep up his facade of air-headed playboy around Tony for any extended period of time. Or hell, maybe he’s keeping it up just fine, if Natasha thinks he needs to cleanse. Still, he makes a note to stop by more often. There’s a certain ease in the Avengers tower that, for all its newness, has yet to take hold in JLA headquarters, at least for Bruce. He doesn’t think about why that could be.  
Before:
It was probably a small miracle that Tony killed Stane before Bruce could get to him.Through a haze of medication in a private hospital bed, Tony had a very strange and disjointed memory of coming awake and seeing Bruce sitting in the visitor’s chair, pitched forward, elbows on his thighs and hands clasped. His slightly downturned face was a complicated rictus of no emotion and too much of it. Tony couldn’t recall ever seeing him look like that before. He worked enough saliva into his mouth to say, “Gotham safe without you for today?” He sounded hoarse and distant even to his own ears. His chest hurt. Bruce didn’t startle, but he took a short breath and let it out. “I only heard bare outlines, and someone’s locked down all of your security footage.”“Mm,” Tony agreed, not really comprehending. Clearly these were good drugs.“Who did this, Tony?” Bruce growled. That…that got through. Tony had to close his eyes. He’d turn away too, but it hurt too much to move. “Obie.”There was a long, dangerous silence. And then Bruce’s hand closed tightly around Tony’s shin. “Is he taken care of?” he asked.Tony cut a glance at him, and said shortly, “Yes.”“You’re not going to tell me how.”“You’ll see it on the news.”“Tony…”“Don’t take that tone with me, I’m drugged and sore and possibly concussed.”“I don’t have a tone,” Bruce said. He paused, and then he said, “This is about the suit, isn’t it?”“What else?” Tony said, looking at the ceiling.“You know what you’re getting into, don’t you?”“It’s not gonna be like you. I’m not The Night, or whatever. I just…I need to make things right.”Bruce sighed. “Always the hard way with you.”“If it’s not difficult, it’s not worth doing.”“I know.” He rose. “Get some rest, Tony. Be safe.”“Too lat
