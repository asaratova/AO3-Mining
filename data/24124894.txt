Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Every morning, as the sun was rising, you would leave your small apartment and make the journey to the cafe down the street, your own little safe haven of fairy lights and caffeine, where you worked dutifully to make more progress on your latest book.  

For half a year you had been following this routine, and it wasn’t until about a month ago that the dark stranger showed up.  James, you soon learned, never spoke to you but he watched. He watched as you held steaming mug after mug in your soft hands and wrapped your overly fluffy cardigan around your shoulders. You exuded warmth and coziness; a softness James had previously only dreamed of.  So he waited and watched, and a week later he had made up his mind; it would be you and only you. You were perfect.
You noticed James on the first day he came into the small cafe, as newcomers were few and far between because of the store’s location on a smaller back street of Brooklyn.  How could you not notice him, a man built like that, looking like the gods of ancient days rippling with a soft power you couldn’t explain.  His dark hair, cut shorter and matching perfectly with his scruffy beard, drew you in unlike any other.  

Of course, you noticed his presence, but you were never quite aware of the amount of attention he paid you, and you certainly never saw the way his eyes would darken when he took in your smaller form, or how he seemed to focus only on you and your constant writing.  To James, he was simply looking at his fate.  And to you, you were merely finishing up your latest chapter, with nothing amiss from the way life had been for the past six months.  But to any astute outsider, it would look like a hungry wolf who had just spotted his next meal.

.🐰.

The day had started off a little different than others, and in your excitement for this big day, you planned to wear your new headband and latest fuzzy sweater.

Today you would be making edits to your completed draft of your recent work before sending it to your publisher tomorrow morning. Today was a day for celebration, so you planned to still go to your favorite cafe and make the final edits there, following your normal routine.

You sat down with your plate with its stack of sugary pastries and your cup of coffee and did a little dance of excitement in your seat as you opened your laptop.  Everything progressed normally until saw a figure approaching your small table by the window.  It was James.  

You had been formally introduced a week back when he accidentally knocked that coffee into you on the way out of the door, and now, he was coming to talk.

James seemed like a quiet man, so you were pleasantly surprised when he asked about your writing and you happily explained your passion and life’s work to him. Your words got more and more passionate as you went on.

“It’s like the words possess me, you know? They flow through me like unfinished sentences demanding completion. I’m their slave; I have to write them, or I can’t sleep, can’t think, can hardly function. Have you ever felt that way?” You rambled on cheerfully until you noticed he was not responding.

“James … did you hear any of that?” you questioned after the silence extended on.  

Of course, James had heard you; his very being had been centered around you since he first spotted you through the cafe window and realized you had to be his. He hadn’t been able to tear his gaze from you for the longest time, how you never noticed was beyond him, and your innocence drew him in like a man in the dark for years who was finally seeing the sun.

James, too, knew the feeling of being gripped by demanding desires like an old friend, except his thoughts were far less innocent than your sweet musings on your craft, and as you spoke, all James’s mind could think of were his familiar thoughts of burying himself deep in your warm body. His growing arousal was only spurred on by your innocent gaze staring up at him so devoutly, as if his response would solve her deepest pondering.  

James thought to himself, ‘Does she know? Does she know how she bewitched me and makes me wan-‘

“James,” you spoke more firmly, “Did you hear anything I just said?” 

Your eyebrows drew together as you grew concerned by his continued silence. This was only your first full conversation, after all, and though he seemed like a fairly quiet man this level of unresponsiveness was unusual. 

Immediately, James grunted, drawn back to reality from his favorite dark thoughts, and he forced out a gruff response.

“I think I might know what you mean, Y/N,” he spoke as he forced his gaze to soften so as not to startle your gentle demeanor which had enraptured him, “I know exactly what you mean.”

James’s voice was rough, yet smooth, something you could get used to hearing. You smiled at him, blushing slightly at his admission, and also at the thought of seeing him again in the future.

James too was planning on seeing you in the future, as he finally made up
