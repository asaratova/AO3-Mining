[10:22 AM]Can we meet for coffee? I just got dumped.[10:22 AM]Apparently it's my fault he dislocated his knee while trying to give a blowjob.  
[10:30 AM]

I think you've got the wrong number.

[10:31 AM]

Unless you make a habit of texting people you don't know about this sort of thing?
 [10:33 AM]...You're not Raven? 
[10:34 AM]

I'm afraid not.
 [10:35 AM]I am so, so sorry. I thought this was my sister. I must have got her new number down wrong, sorry. 
[10:36 AM]

No harm done.
 - 

[11:01 AM]

It's been bugging me for thirty minutes. How exactly did this person dislocate their knee?
 [11:04 AM]Seriously? You actually want to get into the details? 
[11:05 AM]

It's a slow day. I could use a good laugh at someone else’s expense.
 [11:08 AM]Basically, I decided to date someone who's rather young and inexperienced. This morning he tried to be 'sexy' in the shower and ended up slipping when he dropped to his knees.[11:09 AM]I can't believe I just told you that. I'm usually not open about these things, especially with strangers. You could be a serial killer for all I know.
[11:10 AM]

Engineer, not a serial killer. Although some would argue.

[11:11 AM]

How can it be your fault if he slid?
 [11:12 AM]Apparently I assisted in the slipping[11:13 AM]Which is a lie; I kind of just stood there and tired not to laugh. 
[11:14 AM]

I would have laughed.

[11:14 AM]

You sound incredibly upset about your recent breakup.
 [11:15 AM]It was a short relationship. Turns out immature and inexperienced isn't my type.[11:16 AM]Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a class to prepare for. Sorry, again, for getting the wrong number.  -2-

[11:07 AM]

I have a situation.
 [11:13 AM]Why did you keep my number? 
[11:15 AM]

Why did you keep mine?                    
 [11:17 AM]What's the situation? 
[11:18 AM]

Changing the subject?
 [11:18 AM]No. 
[11:20 AM]        

This is going to sound like I'm full of myself (I am), but I have an employee who very obviously has a thing for me (if she comes into my office in tight fitting clothes and purposefully drops something one more time, I think I'll scream), and I very obviously don’t have one for her, but she doesn't seem to understand that.
 [11:22 AM]Oh, I have the same situation, sometimes. The whole student having a thing for their professor ordeal.[11:23 AM]Usually, I'll hint at my being gay. Although one time, one of my female students didn’t seem to get the hint so I got a male friend of mine to run into my office while she was there to 'drop something off' and that worked rather well.[11:24 AM]I doubt that's any help to you, though. Maybe you should just tell her no. Nicely, of course, you don't want to hurt her feelings any more than necessary. 
[11:26 AM]

Nice isn't really my forte.

[11:26 AM]

And I can't believe you did that to a student.
 [11:27 AM]You've been nice enough to me. And what was I supposed to do, encourage her? 
[11:28 AM]

I can tell you're a man of morals.
 [11:28 AM]And you aren't? 
[11:29 AM]

Depends on the topic of discussion.
 [11:30 AM]Back to your situation, just tell her no. Or are you scared to be malicious? 
[11:31 AM]

If only you knew my reputation.

[11:32 AM]

She'll be sure to come into my office later, so I may as well talk to her. Now, though, I have a business meeting.
 [11:33 AM]Tell me how it goes, and good luck with the meeting. --- 
[02:16 PM]

She cried.

[02:16 PM]                                                                             

And I'm now short one employee.
 [02:23 PM]Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that. 
[02:25 PM]

Eh, she shouldn’t be too hard to replace.
 [02:26 PM]Don't sound too upset. 
[02:28 PM]

Oh, I'm actually trying to keep back the tears. Couldn't you tell?
 [02:30 PM]I thought I could sense it. 
[02:31 PM]

I don’t know how I’ll continue to live.
 [02:31 PM]Terribly sorry for your loss, but I’ve got to run. I hope you don't lose anyone else!  -3-

[08:25 AM]Hey, stranger. 
[08:32 AM]

What do you want?
 [08:35 AM]Not a morning person? 
[08:36 AM]

I like mornings. What I don't like is idiot employees spilling burning hot coffee all over me.
 [08:37 AM]Ouch[08:37 AM]Anything I can do to help? I really just wanted someone to talk to before I start class. 
[08:39 AM]

Get me new coffee? And perhaps a new staff?
 [08:40 AM]If only I could.[08:41 AM]I'm not much of a coffee person, myself. I prefer tea. I think it's because of all the years spent in England. It's not the same here, Americans just don't do tea properly. 
[08:45 AM]

I can relate to that. I don’t care how ‘authentic’ your café claims to be. No one, excluding my mother, can make German pastries to my satisfaction.
 [08:46 AM]You're German? 
[08:46 AM]

Born and bred.
 [08:47 AM]You intrigue me. 
[08:49 AM]

And you distract me from my work.
 [08:50 AM]No one said you had to reply.  -4-
