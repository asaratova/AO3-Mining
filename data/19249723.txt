This might just be the day Twitter crashes. We can only pray now that one of the others show up and confirm…
You Know Who I Am @IronMan
@Spiderman I thought we agreed you were gonna stop taking dangerous pictures from the tops of buildings?
Goodbye Lucy @LucilleSanders
Talk about prayers coming true quick. @AmIThough Did you pray to Thor or something?
You Know Who I Am @IronMan
@Spiderman Don’t ignore me. I know your notifications are on.
Friendly Neighborhood @Spiderman
There was no agreement. You said stop taking dangerous pictures. I said it’s not dangerous.
Original Spider @BlackWidow
Tony, you know he’s fine. He thrives on ridiculous heights and humanly impossible balance.

Leave him be, Nat. You know he worries about his boy.
