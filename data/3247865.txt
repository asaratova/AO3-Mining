Chapter 1: Coffee Shop AU
    




Chapter Text
When Natasha started coming into the cafe, it must have been on someone else's shifts.  The first time I saw her, Clint was already treating her like a regular.  He put her coffee down in a saucer near her right hand before she even ordered.  She was looking at her phone, drawing one finger down it in smooth lines. There was something about her mouth while she looked at her phone, a tick on the right side.  Maybe something was frustrating her.She reached for her coffee and took a drink without even looking at it.I watched her for a week before I talked to her for the first time. It sounds completely ridiculous to say that the first thing I noticed about her were her hands.  I know that she's gorgeous,and that should have been the first thing I saw.  But there was such a smoothness to the way she used her hands.  I could imagine them being gentle. There was a fluidity to her movements that was hard to describe. It was like she was always completely aware of her body.When she got up to add some cream to her coffee, I don't know what made me say it.  Maybe it was a stupid thing to say, but most of the things I say are stupid. I just usually keep talking until I work my way around to something funny.“Are you a dancer?” It was a stupid thing to say. My voice was too loud. But the coffee shop was loud, this time of day, and our regulars are used to my loudness. It was like Clint’s visual loudness-- part of the ambiance. They liked to be able to wave to Jane on the street, and impress their friends. Yes, I know the girl with the Dahlia piercings and the half shaved head, we’re friends. I’m artistic and open minded, haven’t you noticed that about me?I thought maybe I'd surprised her. It was hard to tell.  Her face had a stillness to it, like the surface of a pond. It was sort of restful. I wondered what I looked like to her. Big boobs, big hair-- but maybe she noticed the other things.  I mean, I have hidden depths.“What makes you ask me that?” She said it softly, her eyebrows raising up a little. They were a little lighter than the rest of her hair, which was perfect. The most perfect curls, the most perfect skin, like a photograph of a person. I wanted to touch it to confirm her reality, which was  inappropriate, and was not something I was going to do. Obviously. I always want to touch people's hair when it's a fun color. It’s part of why I like Jane, because she lets me. I can be too tactile for a lot of people.  I think Jane misses touch, since Thor went on his little ‘spiritual enlightenment’ journey. Or whatever he's been doing for the last two years.  I missed touch, and I didn't even have a Thor to miss.  Maybe that's why I liked Natasha's hands so much, because I wanted them to touch me.Okay, so I was a little infatuated, already. I shrugged, “I don’t know, just a vibe I get from you. You’re like, dark chocolate smooth, the way you move.” Jesus Christ, I’m rhyming now.Clint draped himself on the counter next to me, the long V of his shirt showing way too much man cleavage. Okay, I looked, I’m human.“I think she may already be composing odes to your beauty Nat.” Clint said, a little mocking and a little jealous. I remember the first time I let him read my poetry. It was a month after he started working at the cafe, just the three of us getting drunk after one of Thor’s letters.  He talked endlessly about how much he loved her but didn’t give the kind of details that Jane was thirsty for. Sometimes I could see her drying up like a houseplant.  I’d water her with glasses of absinthe and girls’ nights where we'd paint our nails and cut up magazines for collages.Jane is an artist, an amazing one. The things her brain comes up with are beyond my understanding most of the time. All sacred geometry and endless details. I know what she makes is beautiful, and that sometimes I can help by handing her things. Or making her sleep.  Or putting a cup of something hot next to her desk before I go to bed. Clint had stared at the one in the living room for almost half an hour, just taking it in.  I was afraid for a moment that he’d fallen in love with her, the way Thor had at one of her art openings. He hadn’t looked like the type to fall in love with Jane, some tall blond a suit, but he’d stared and stared at her work.  And then at her, with the same astonishment. Like he couldn’t believe that something like her actually existed.I think in a way, she broke him.I could tell though, that Clint didn’t love Jane that way. He struck me as someone who played for the other team. But he looked at her  differently after that, like he finally got her. When he asked if I was an artist, and I’d told him no, he smiled at me, and there was a little edge to it.“Really?” He’d said, with his eyebrows up, all wide eyed innocence. Now, I would recognize him goading me, but I was young and naive back then. (Yes, I know it was only like a year and a half ago, but I’ve experienced a lot of person
