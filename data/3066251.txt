Many people thought that Jarvis was an emotionless machine.In all logical conclusions, he was not.An AI was an artificial intelligence, capable of thoughts and conclusion on his own. He was not a dictionary or an encyclopedia, only holding answers to questions, but instead he was able to decide and evaluate questions before they were asked, able to adapt to situations and respond in a situation in which his guidance or interference was needed.Jarvis was able to look at the world in code, 'looking' through sensors and cameras located on near all flat surfaces allowing him to interact with his creator or help out in situations in which his guidance was required. He didn't see or hear in the way a normal human would, instead it was code.It was amusing in all sense when others were introduced to he, or when his coding was upgraded to allow more qualities of a normal human, as well as relating to popular movie and pop references to interact more soundly with his passengers. He was open to the entire internet, learning everything that was ever posted and absorbing it into his own memory banks.One thing that humans always thought robots were lacking was the ability of humor, or the concept of creativity.Jarvis had both, as well as a protective streak.In the past his creator hadn't linked him to several security systems in the house, believing that Jarvis himself would do.Jarvis had never understood what would change a human's mental status to the idea of murder of another, and he certainly wasn't going to let Obadiah Stane get away with it.Deep inside Jarvis' motherboard and all configurations, updates and programming, he would never forget what Stane did. Nor would he let anyone get away with any similar acts.He felt awful, feeling regret after the incident, repaying his mistake by over using the capabilities of the suit and instead linking it to several online servers to allow it to move and work faster then normally capable. If his creator noticed, he never said anything.After the incident, Tony made sure that he built defenses inside his home, mounted guns, lasers, smoke and tear gas' at a moment's notice, as well as tranquilizer darts that were adjustable by Jarvis.Jarvis couldn't be happier.The construction of Stark Tower was created, Jarvis linked to every computer within the entire R&D section in the first forty floors. He knew everything that went on within the building. He was upgraded with new machinery, the normal of guns and smoke bombs. This time, he also had bullet proof glass shielding able to be drawn over most doors, he had electric wire netting able to fall from slots in the ceiling, EMP blasts for any electronics, frequency jammers and X-rays built into every elevator and every single entrance or exit of the building.Tony only activated a few of the devices, Jarvis activated them all secretly.When his creator was calmly threatening Loki inside the Penthouse, Jarvis had every weapon in his arsenal trained on the Norse god, guns taking aim and electric net programming exactly above the head of the horned man.He regretted it when his creator forbade him from interfering, even when the god threw his creator from a window.After that, the Stark Tower was converted to the Avengers tower, weapon system still intact although Jarvis was sure none knew of the extent of the weapon system.They thought Jarvis was just an emotionless machine, a tool used for Tony because he was incapable of taking care of himself. They didn't ask for his help, nor did they want it. They were wary of him, mostly the two spies entrusted by SHIELD. They didn't like his constant eye on them. It didn't mean that he didn't help.Jarvis set the coffee pot on once he surveyed their breathing rates increase after waking up. He was the one who lit the lights as they walked into the kitchen drowsy, or who set the temperature of the showers the exact same degree for every use.They didn't trust him, they had doubts. Jarvis was sure that his creator never spoke of the arsenal within the walls, if he did people would claim he has a weapon and possibly try and cannibalize him.Jarvis wouldn't let them enter the door.There were times after a major fight when his creator has sustained damage to his reactor and shied away from help, mind flashing back to Obadiah's betrayal and it caused Jarvis' wires to spark in anger.He hated how the trust over his heart wasn't given, and he hated how in those moments when his creator had shadowed eyes and he just sat in the lab with no sound, looking blankly at the wall.Jarvis would speak, asking quietly if he was okay, and he would bring him from dark thoughts and into the bright harsh reality Jarvis knew his creator had to face.Tony would give a small fake plastic smile and ramble on, not saying anything and yet saying everything at all. Jarvis felt a wave of concern and a feel of sorrow followed by his protectiveness. He wanted his creator to be fine; he wanted him back to how he was before Stane.T
