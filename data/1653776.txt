Chapter 1: Dreams (Steve Rogers X Reader)
    




Chapter Text
You didn't even realize that you had been screaming at first. You were too caught up in the nightmare, choking with terror and fear as your heart pounded in your chest.You jolted awake, thrashing around wildly as the bedsheets tangled around your legs and those horrid images continued to flicker infront of your eyes. A chunk of light suddenly cut through the darkness and fear as someone yanked open the door to your bedroom and rushed in. You shrunk back against the headboard, whimpering in terror, until a familiar voice registered with you."_____! Calm down, _____! It's me, Steve.""Steve?" you croaked as he approached you quickly and dropped down onto the edge of the bed beside you. Even in the half-light you could see the concern and worry glinting in his sky blue eyes."Another nightmare, huh?" He asked gently, though it was obvious that he already knew the answer.You nodded mutely, unable to speak. You didn't want to start crying and feared you would if you opened your mouth.He reached out and pulled you into his firm chest, wrapping his strong arms around you and rocking you gently. You grabbed a fistful of his t-shirt and clung to him. Only then, against his solid body, did you realize how badly that you had been trembling. After a few minutes, when the trembling had somewhat ceased, you moved away and slid out of the bed. "I want to go and splash some cold water onto my face," you explained as you made your way into the ensuite bathroom and closed the door.You leaned against the cool wood of the door for a few seconds, breathing deeply before you turned and crossed over to the sink. Putting in the plug, you leaned over and gripped the sides of it so tightly that your knuckles paled as you waited for it to fill up. You splashed some of the water up onto your face, and began to feel slightly less shaky. Deciding it was time to get it together and let Steve return to his room to sleep, you opened the bathroom door, and then came to an abrupt halt. Instead of sitting on your bed as he had been when you left him, Steve Rogers was now in your bed with the blankets pooled around his waist to reveal a tight grey T-shirt that clung to his well defined abs. He had your bedside light on, and was holding one of your favourite books open in his hands. Despite your current condition, the reality that Steve in your bed (something you'd fantasized about since you met him) had come true, resulted in a huge blush creeping over your features."What are you doing?" You asked, thanking God that your voice hadn't gone all high and breathy."I'm going to stay with you tonight," he answered, lowering the book as he finally noticed you were there. "This is the fifth nightmare you've had this week. Maybe my presence will help somehow... Calm you down, or something?"Yeah. Calm me down. Riiiiiiiiiight.  His gorgeous, earnest face and sexily dishevelled bedhead made your heart begin to pound faster than it had before.Instead of letting any of your inner thoughts show on your face, you gave what you hoped was a nonchalant shrug and walked back over to the bed. He shifted over slightly to make more room for you as you clambered in beside him, and before you could touch it he lifted the duvet and draped it over you, tucking it in at your side. In order to do this, he had to lean slightly over you. The proximity of his face and the scent of his shampoo made butterflies begin to stir in your stomach."Thanks," you said quietly, snuggling down beside him and resting your head on your pillow.He shot you an affectionate look and leaned back against the headboard, opening the book once again and continuing to read. You watched in fascination as his lips moved along with the words on the page, and his brow furrowed and raised as the events of the story stirred different emotions within him."Read it aloud," you whispered, and so he did.His voice washed over you, calming and melodic. The feeling of security and peace began to creep up on you, and your eyes began to grow heavy. After a while, he stopped reading and bent over so that he carefully deposited your book on the floor. He turned back to face you and lay down. You could feel his hot breath faintly tickling your face.You forced your eyes to stay open, and you both just stared at eachother without saying a single word. There was a rustling sound as he carefully lifted his hand out from under the blanket. Slowly, he brushed a strand of hair out of your face. You swallowed heavily, and then decided to just go for it. You moved closer, burrowing into his chest with your head fitted under his chin. One warm arm draped around your waist, holding you against him. You heard him exhale loudly through his nose, and looked up to see his eyes closed as a blissful expression crossed his features."You know, this is very comfortable," he confided softly."You should cuddle with me more often then," you replied bravely.He rewarded you with a d
