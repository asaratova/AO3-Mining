Work Text:
Agatha can feel the leylines converging beneath this house. All of that power, ancient and troubled, flowing outward into the ether with no one to control it… it’s delicious. It isn’t the aftertaste of magic that led her to this town, but it’s a nice hors d’oeuvre. A nice little portal all her own.She knocks on the door of the untidy house above the convergence.A young man answers. “Can I like, help you? Did I get high and order a pizza again?”Mortal men. Such a waste of life essence. Agatha touches his cheek.His eyes flicker black.
