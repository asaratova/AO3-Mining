Chapter Text
“What the hell do you mean ‘he’s ours’?” Clint inquired, a borderline angry look on his face. He eyed the figure behind Thor wearily. The other Avengers stood stiff, watching the conversation carefully. Thor chuckled sheepishly. “My apologies,” he started, “I should have worded that more clearly. The Allfather has decided to give you custody of my brother. His magic has him binded to tell nothing but the truth so fear not his silver tongue. He is binded to do whatever it is you command.” Thor looked serious now. His blue eyes were hardened in the sunlight. “To clarify, whatever you tell him to do, he has to do.”That was when Tony stepped in.“Hold up,” He waved his hands in the air, “you’re giving us your brother as a slave?” He asked. Thor opened his mouth to object, but hesitated as he thought about what Tony had said. It was evident that Thor was not happy about these circumstances, but he had never considered it slavery. The god of thunder turned to his brother with sad eyes. Loki avoided his stare.“What do you mean ‘he has to obey us’?” Steve questioned from the side. He had been watching intently, but he now seemed to have questions of his own. “Our father has binded him with ancient magic. The magic connects him to whomever the Allfather wishes to cast commands. In this case, it is all of you.”The avengers looked at each other, and then to the trickster. They noticed a couple things were different since they had last seen him. For instance; His hair was lacking its sleek greasy look, it had much more volume and looked much softer, his skin was almost translucent in the sun’s glow. And all of those things were different, but most of all they noticed his eyes. When Loki had invaded, his eyes had been a striking blue. They had drawn attention to all around him. It was almost as if they glowed. They had been even more vibrant than Clint’s. Had there been different circumstances, they would have been absolutely beautiful. But then again he had murdered hundreds of people. They hadn’t had time to admire his eyes. But now, now his eyes were anything but striking. They had lost their light, they were dull. Not only had they lost their vibrance, but they had lost their colour. They seemed green now. It put the Avengers on edge. “Are we allowed to decline?” Natasha asked. It was the first time she had spoken since Thor had arrived.  She had spent her time silently observing the god of mischief. “You may, but he would end up going to another person. Most likely the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” Thor stated. And while he seemed nonchalant, there was a pleading look in his eyes. They could see it in his face. He was begging them to take his brother. “Well then we have to take him,” Bruce piped up, “we can’t just let them take him to prod and experiment on…” There was a murmur of agreement.
“Hold up,” Tony started, “why would it be so bad if S.H.I.E.L.D. got him? You guys do remember how many people he killed right?” 

“Tony,” Bruce sighed, “Just think of it this way, Loki can do the cleaning. He can do whatever you want him to do. What use is he to you with S.H.I.E.L.D.?” He asked. That seemed to resonate with Tony as he grinned wide. 



“You do seem to be right my dear Brucie.” He tried to put his elbow on Bruce, which was quite a feat seeing as how short the billionaire was. He turned to Thor with a wide smile. “We’ll take him!” He declared. 



“Tony,” Steve chided, “We have to make that decision as a team!” 



“Well,” Tony turned, “were you going to let him become a lab rat?” He asked. Slowly, Steve shook his head.



“There we go!” Tony yelled excitedly, “Decision made! Team happy! Gimme gimme.” He made a grabby motion with his hands. Loki raised a brow at the childlike behaviour but did not speak. Thor sighed. 



“Very well,” He hugged Loki gently, and for once, the trickster didn’t resist. He simply breathed in his brothers scent and prayed to the norns that these avengers wouldn’t be the death of him, “I must return home, but I promise I will visit. Be safe.” Thor said, before raising his hammer in the air. “Heimdall!” He cried. A large cylinder of light showered upon the thunderer and just like that he was gone.



“Well reindeer games,” Tony started, “get your crazy ass over here.” He commanded jokingly. Loki’s eyes widened as a small glimmer of silver magic passed over his body. He walked stiffly over to the group. They watched bewildered. 



“Did you do that?” Steve asked. Loki simply shook his head. “That was a command. Therefore the magic acted on its own accord.”



The Avengers took a second to process this. “Hold up,” Clint said, “so the magic just decides what and what isn’t a command.” He asked. Loki nodded slowly.



“I suppose so.”



“You suppose” Tony inquired. “What, you don’t know?” 





“No.”







“What? Do you not know anything about this magic?” Clint asked.







“I know as much as you know, Mr. Barton.” Loki said, bo
