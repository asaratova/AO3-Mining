Chapter Text

Darcy had just gotten out of class, and was on her way to work when she got Jane’s texts, a flurry of messages that made people send annoyed looks in her direction at the continuous chiming of her phone.

WHERE ARE YOU There was a blissful break when she shoved her way onto the subway car, but the moment she stepped back onto the platform, she gave up and called Jane.Jane picked up, and before she could speak Darcy hurriedly cut her off. “Before you say anything, just FYI: you’re going to be paying the overcharge bills for my text messages this month.”“Fine, fine,” Jane said distractedly, “but Darcy, there’s this new coffee place across the street and the owner is such an asshole and he said the shop theme was stupid and I need you to – y’ to – to – ”“Whoa, whoa, slow down there, bosslady.” Darcy heard Jane take a few mouthfuls of air. “Okay, so new competitor, owned by a dickwad. What’s the sitch?”Jane didn’t even hesitate. “I need you to go scope out the place.”Darcy blinked slowly. “What, like spy on it?”“Isn’t that what I said?”“Okay…” She stopped at the corner of 47th, right across the street from Bifrost Kaffe, and saw Jane gesturing wildly in the shop window, mouthing what looked like the word ‘NO.’ “… So why exactly are you flailing around like a crazy lady?”“He can’t see you come in here!” Jane’s voice hissed in her ear, and Darcy looked on the other side of 6th Avenue to see a sleek storefront, the chrome and glass providing an interesting contrast to Bifrost’s old industrial aesthetic of brick, wood, and wrought iron. “The asshole kicked out Ian when I tried to send him over to do some scouting. Just go inside and tell me what it’s like – we need to know what we’re up against!”“And the dickwad won’t kick me out why…?”Darcy could practically hear the eye roll. “Are you really asking me that?”“So what, pretend like I’m an unemployed hipster writing sad poetry, and flash him my tits if he comes over?” Darcy mused, but turned away from Bifrost and crossed the street towards Stark Espresso Bar.“Or something like that,” Jane muttered absentmindedly, and Darcy giggled. “If they ask why you’re taking pictures say it’s for Instagram or Facebook or something – I’ll give you the day off, just make sure you get down their drink menu and food selection and shop layout and decorations and – " “Everything, basically.” Darcy sent Jane a discreet thumbs up and a grin. “Got it, bosslady, I’ll send reports. Ciao.”She hung up before Jane could reply, opting to pretend like she didn’t see Jane sticking her tongue out at her through the window, and pushed open the door.It wasn’t too crowded, as it was that odd lull between the lunchtime rush and late-afternoon coffee breaks, but it was respectably busy, as the rumbling of the coffee grinder and hiss of steaming milk made her smile. She dumped her tote bag at a table near the window, giving her a good vantage point of the whole shop as well as Bifrost across the street, and went up to the counter to place her order.“A large cappuccino and two raspberry tarts, please.” The smiling man at the counter was sweet and nice – although Darcy had to wonder at what kind of parents would name their kid Happy, even if he was aptly named – and brought the entire order to Darcy’s table on a white ceramic tray that made her inner hipster salivate. Two perfect raspberry tarts were plated next to a wide-bowled cup, complete with a steel coffee stir-stick, fancy napkins with the shop logo monogrammed across the bottom, and both raw and refined sugar in little porcelain dishes. The gorgeous little silhouette of the New York skyline streaked across the foam of her cup only made it all that much better.She took a quick aerial shot after rearranging the contents, filtering the photo through a photo-editing app before sending the image off to Jane. The response was instantaneous – an entire paragraph of poop emojis.Darcy pulled out a book and settled in – alternating between Plato and her snack, save for the occasional upward glances to scribble down the shop menu in the margins of her book. She took a trip to the bathroom to make a rough sketch of the café on the inside of her forearm, ordered a double shot of espresso and a croissant after the late-afternoon rush hour passed, and spent the next couple hours people watching and using her book to hide her phone, as she discreetly
