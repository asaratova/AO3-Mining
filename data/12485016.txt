“So, we gonna talk about you almost calling me dad back there? And in front of your entire class too,” he gently mocked, watching Peter turn red. He’s just taken Peter away from a school trip he really had no reason to be on, he feels free to mock him gently now after saving him.“No,” Peter answers.“I think we should at least consider talking about it. Especially since it was the first thing to come out before even Mr Stark.”“Well, I don’t want to discuss it.”“Okay even I know that isn’t healthy.”“All of us need some unhealthy behaviours. It’s what lets us know which are the healthy ones.”“That is officially  the worst  therapist’s advice I have ever heard, please, never go into psychiatry. Aside from that, I really don’t mind you know?” It’s a rhetorical question and they both know it, but...still.Peter snorts. “I never want to go into psychiatry. I never want to touch anything to do with psychiatry with a ten foot pole.” There’s a pause, long enough in which Tony gives him  a look . “And I...figured you wouldn’t mind, exactly, it’s just, difficult? I guess, to bring up. How was I even supposed to bring up something like that? Deliberately, I mean,” Peter tacks on.“Well I have no idea, so let’s thank your lack of brain-to-mouth filter then, yes?”“Had to inherit something other than reckless stupidity, superheroing, and extreme intelligence,” Peter points out sarcastically.“Yeah, be thankful you didn’t inherit any of my bad traits,” Tony snorted arrogantly.“Because reckless stupidity isn’t bad or anything,” Peter points out. “Not to mention some people see superheroing as a very bad thing.”“Well those people own twelve percent of the shares in my company and should keep busy with running said company.”“Slightly rude, don’t you think?”“Whatever, point is, you almost called me dad in front of your entire class and I’m giving you permission to do it consistently.”“Alright thanks.” Tony looks at him again and he sighs, “Dad.”“That’s my boy!” Tony slaps him on the back playfully and Peter sends him a withering glare and a smirk at the fact it didn’t move him at all.  
Bruce came and went as he went, for the most part, working with Tony more often than not and not leaving for more than a couple of days at a time and always calling if he was going to be late.After the whole Ragnarok business and leaving the planet with no warning, Tony liked to keep a closer eye on him. Granted he muttered over Wanda being the entire cause of that - which Peter could hardly deny since it was her actions which caused him to run in the first place, which led to the chain reaction of events-  but not the point right now .No, the point was that Bruce worked with Tony - his dad - a lot, but he was still getting into the habit of calling him that.Of calling him Dad.It was incredibly strange at first, and a couple of times he still made the same mistake which led up to him calling Tony dad in the first place: “Da- Mr Star- Tony,” except now he added a final “Dad,” on the end.Tony snorted every time and just shook his head.But it’s hardly been a week since he started and it was getting easier each time to not correct himself when he immediately went to.So, when he got the highest A in the physics class test he had this week, that he wouldn’t have aced if  his dad  hadn’t helped him, he can hardly be blamed for bursting into the lab holding it high and yelling out, “Dad I got  the highest  grade in the class!”Tony smiled brightly as Peter walked around the room. “That’s great, Pete, I told you you’d do it.” He sounded like a proud  dad  and he  was  but it was just so weird to think that he had  a dad  to be proud of him. Different from an Aunt May to be proud of him in a way he doesn’t understand. Peter goes over to the ‘bots and and talks to them a little.He gets a series of beeps and whirrs in return for his questions and answers.Dum-E presents him with a smoothie, it’s dark purple and when he smells it it doesn’t smell...horrible?Then he tastes it, “Really Dummy? Prunes?! And you  did  put motor oil in this!” Peter says in mock outrage and turns away with a pout, intending to walk away before Dum-E is attempting to nuzzle into his side.Despite the slight pain it brought him, Peter allowed it for several moments before he released himself.“Alright, apology accepted, but you have to let me go.” He rubs over the top of his claw, like one might a dog, then walked over to his dad and Bruce.“You’re comfortable,” Bruce pointed out with slight humour. “Much more than when I last saw you in here.”“Well, it’s been a long week and a half,” Peter grins.“And here I thought Tony would never be a father.” Said man scoffs.“I hardly have to put any effort in, just wind him up to go. His aunt already did all the hard work and I get the almost-finished project of a tiny genius exactly like me but without the arrogance and ego problems.”“Totally understandable,” Bruce nods sagely. “It’s not as if you don’t do anything for him now,” he says sarca
