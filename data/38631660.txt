Chapter 1: moodboard and blurb
    




Chapter Text
 
“I hope you don’t forget me when you’re famous,” Cindy jokes.
 
“I’ll remember you, Cindy. You don’t have to worry about that.”  Cindy smiles at Seol Hee’s words. 

I’ll remember you.

 She’ll remember Seol Hee long after this summer, as well.
 
 

I’ll remember you.

 
The words echo in Cindy’s mind as the events of that day run through her mind lightning fast, complete with the brilliant colors of the sunset as she stands rooted to the concrete on that street corner. She’s staring at a woman surrounded by stone-faced security guards in black suits, emerging from a car. The international K-Pop star, Luna Snow.
 
Luna steps onto the concrete and tosses her hair while the concierge rattles on and on, an almost… 

familiar

 look of polite boredom on her face. Something pertaining to the building, no doubt. But Cindy is caught off guard. She breathes in sharply as the realization hits her. The white hair is new, as well as the choppy and uneven style. But other than that, Cindy would know her anywhere. She knew her for one summer, and has seen her in her dreams ever since then. The woman turns, and suddenly Cindy can’t breathe. It’s her greatest dream and her worst nightmare all at once.
 
It’s Seol Hee.
