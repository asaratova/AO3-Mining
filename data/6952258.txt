*I want you to know
one thing. 

You know how this is: 
if I look 
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
of the slow autumn at my window, 
if I touch 
near the fire 
the impalpable ash 
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
everything carries me to you, 
as if everything that exists, 
aromas, light, metals, 
were little boats 
that sail 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

Meeting Steve was like breathing after being a long time underwater, it was exhilarating and it made him feel alive again.Tony loved him since the beginning, before they have met…after the first story about Steve Rogers (the kid from Brooklyn) that his Aunt Peggy had told him.He remembers tracing, over and over, the name on his wrist ever since it appeared at his eight birthday; the elegant penmanship forming his soulmate’s name, his finger following each curve and sharp angle the move full of longing and heartache. He still does it, when he feels especially anxious it seems to help him calm, it’s like a balm for the hole in his soul a kind of painkiller for the ache that resides in his heart. It is a little silly, taking comfort in something so childish, but it has been one of the few touches that had lighten some of the burden since childhood…only comparable to his mother’s and Jarvis’ hugs.That’s why he is doing it now, inconspicuously as he can, telling his team about Charles Spencer’s death and his position towards the Accords, he can feel Steve’s disapproval through the bond a feeling so muted that makes Tony wonder if his partner is trying to quell it.At some point Tony tries to maintain eye contact with Steve, but he receives a text and leaves the room without explanation. Another feeling unusually quiet pass…it’s grief.An incoming call comes from his own phone and Sharon Carter tells him that Aunt Peggy is dead. His world crumbles a little more, another piece falls and he is alone to deal with it; his soulmate is already in a quinjet flying toward London so lost in his own sorrow that he does not remember that he has another person who he can share it with, Steve lost his girl, Tony lost the last member of his family.*He wonders if Steve knew that he was there, he chose to sit the last row trying to pass unnoticed and went through the ceremony in calm dealing with his loss. He heard Sharon’s speech and the glances that she and Steve shared. It was when he knew that Steve wouldn’t sign the Accords.His wrist hurts and Steve’s name feels a little hot, Tony nods to the pilot and goes to Vienna with Natasha, he sees the news in the middle of the flight.Bucky Barnes’ face is in all the news, the count of deaths is rising and General Cross is filling his voice mail with angry demands for information. He closes his eyes and breathing is difficult, he waits for something but nothing comes from Steve’s end not anger or hurt and it scares shitless Tony.The flight pass to quickly and he is in front of Steve trying to convince him in signing, he wants to explain that it’s their best shot if they want to have a hand in something that appears to be irremediable.But Wanda’s custody in the Complex changes it all and Steve turns in someone Tony doesn’t recognize.
“Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth”
He is furious, with himself and with Steve, but self-deprecation still works and he hates himself a little bit more; because Tony could have prevented it, or at least he could have tried harder to make Steve listen.But then the Winter Soldier escapes, again, tries to kill him and whoever is put in front of him. Steve goes after him and Tony convinces himself that it is right, Barnes is Steve’s best friend and of course he will go for him. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t stop to see if Tony is okay, he must have feel it from the bond; but that doesn’t calm Tony as he wants, something inside of him is shouting wrongwrongwrong and everything begin to seem faded.Tony persuades General Ross to let him in charge to the persecution in hopes to protect his wayward other half.He traces Steve’s name from memory inside his left wrist again and again, the gesture is less soothing that he remembers.

Well, now, 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I shall stop loving you little by little. 

If suddenly 
you forget me 
do not look for me, 
for I shall already have forgotten you. 

If you think it long and mad, 
the wind of banners 
that passes through my life, 
and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots, 
remember 
that on that day, 
at that hour, 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land.

There is the memory from their first kiss, it was sweet and he associated it with the savor of peaches and the smell of petrichor, he guards the remembrance with all his might, willing himself in never forgetting it.He recalls the memory in the route towards Leipzig remembering that it’s his soulmate who will be there, it will be Steve his other half and he will be able to
