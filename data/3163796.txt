 Prompt Table B: 100 Prompts. 

 
This set of prompts will feature crossovers between Harry Potter and The Avengers (and some will also be the movies before and after the Avengers. IE: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Iron Man 1, 2 and 3, etc.)
 
Prompts 96-100 are Reader's/Writer's choice prompts. Prompts given by you, my readers or ones I come up with myself.
 
Prompts are listed below (Prompts will not be posted in numerical order.Some of these have been written in advance (as such some were written before Captain America: TWS came out on DVD) and some are being written as these are posted. I tend to like having a good amount written before I start posting so there is never a gap in between chapters. These prompts will probably be posted every other day with 2-3 being put up each day.
