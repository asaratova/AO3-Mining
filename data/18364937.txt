Lennie was not really a sadistic woman.She had a slight sociopathic streak though, which was most likely why she was so excited right now. The school was in disrepair after the attack from Cap and S.H.I.E.L.D., but Lennie ran up. As she came into the mansion’s rec room, she was hardly surprised to see Logan pacing, snarling with his claws out. Scott was nursing a bruised jaw, glaring at the opposite wall. Jean watched Logan, lips pressed together and arms folded tightly over her chest. Gambit sat on one of the chairs, hands clenched together so tightly they were white. Storm stood at the Professor’s back glaring darkly out the window. The storm outside was a testament to her mood. The Professor was staring stoically ahead.That was, until he caught her thoughts. He looked up. ‘How interesting.’‘Isn’t it?’ Lennie responded.Logan stopped pacing and whirled on her. ‘What?’ he snapped.Lennie didn’t flinch. ‘Do you remember Bucky Barnes?’‘Cap’s little best bud? What about him?’‘Well, he fell from a train and was presumed dead in ’45. Turns out he was actually captured and brainwashed by the enemy. He’s been the Winter Soldier for the past 70 years, until Cap found out and de-brainwashed him.’Logan paused. His claws began to retract and he cocked an eyebrow. His lips tugged upwards, making him look almost malicious. ‘And why ain’t anyone heard o’ this?’Lennie smirked herself. ‘Because Cap decided he wasn’t guilty of anything he did because he was brainwashed, and therefore not responsible for his own actions. He even went so far as to conceal everything from everyone he could, but there were still a few cracks.’Everyone in the room looked up. The mood in the room had lifted. They were all thinking the same thing. Most of them just needed some confirmation. Scott asked, ‘And what’s the Winter Soldier?’Logan answered. ‘A secret political assassin. No one was ever sure if he was real or legend.’Storm looked at Lennie. ‘How did you find out about it then? If no one was sure he existed and then Rogers hid the fact that he did exist, rightfully you should have had no way of knowing.’‘Sure,’ Lennie said. ‘If Howard and Maria Stark weren’t on his list of victims. Barnes killed them and made it look like a car accident. Tony Stark found out, and Cap briefly tried to deny it. Of course then Tony told Potts, Rhodey, and Hogan. Now, Pepper Potts and I have a mutual friend who always suspected the Winter Soldier was real. Potts confirmed it to them. When they found out this school had been attacked, and why, they called me up and passed the information on.’‘We can use this, oui?’ Gambit asked.‘Most certainly,’ the Professor said.‘Yeah,’ Lennie grinned, ‘and Sharee’s agreed to help us. I know just how to do it too. Have any of you ever met Matt Murdock?’

Laura sat in the chair, watching the two men argue over her.‘What?’ the Captain demanded of what Mr. Murdock just said.‘That was the best chance she had of a normal life and you took it away from her.’‘She has killed hundreds of people, Matt!’ the Cap yelled.Mr. Murdock held up the letter from her mother. ‘Did you even read this? It’s a copy of Sarah’s letter Logan gave her. It’s a confession, written by one of the murderers you’re after. Sarah claims responsibility for every death committed by this child. Every single one, including the execution of the other guilty parties at the Facility.’The Captain waved it off. ‘That doesn’t change a thing.’‘No, it changes everything.’ Mr. Murdock was clearly growing impatient. ‘Don’t you see, everyone you’re after is dead?! And Laura is as much a victim here as the people she was forced to kill!’‘X-23 cannot just be let go!’ the Captain insisted. ‘She has to be held accountable!’‘And do you think S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to do that?’ Mr. Murdock demanded coldly. ‘That they’ll put her on trial or lock her up? They’re going to use her, Steve. You’re handing over a weapon to S.H.I.E.L.D. and they’ll use her like one.’‘This conversation is over.’ The Captain reached for Laura’s chains.Suddenly Mr. Murdock’s cane shot across, knocking his hand back. ‘No, it isn’t.’ He moved his cane to his other hand and laid a hand on Laura’s shoulder. ‘Now, speaking as her lawyer, I cannot allow you to—’‘Don’t do this.’ The Cap got in his face and interrupted him. He reached for her chains again.Laura saw Mr. Murdock nod towards the door though. The door opened. A bright golden beam of light shot through and hit the Cap moments before he grabbed her chain. He was thrown across the room and into the wall. Laura immediately smelt Lennie, Logan, the Professor, Gambit, and one other.The other one was a young woman in her twenties who walked in. ‘Captain, I highly doubt you had a warrant for this girl’s arrest. They don’t bother issuing them for mutants. That makes your arrest and detainment of her quite illegal.’The Cap looked up at her, glaring.Mr. Murdock stepped aside as Logan strode over. SNITKT! His claws came out and he cut Laura’s chains away
