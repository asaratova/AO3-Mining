Chapter Text

After one meeting, Jefferson Davis thought the new Spiderman was a little short and had a bit of a weird voice, but didn’t really think twice about it.

After two meetings, Jefferson realized the new Spiderman was 

really

 short for a hero, almost as if he was young, and the voice sounded almost fake, like he was trying to make it sound deeper on purpose.

After three meetings, Jefferson decided the voice was definitely fake, which made him wonder what on earth the new Spiderman was trying to hide.

After four meetings and seeing numerous interviews on television, Jefferson finally realized that the new Spiderman was a kid. And not a college kid, not even a high school kid, but a kid around the same age as his 

son.


And that’s when the trouble really began.

“This new Spiderman...I think he’s Miles’s age,” Jefferson said suddenly one night.

Rio paused in washing the dishes from where she stood at the sink. “What makes you say that?”

“I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’ve talked to him face to face,” he admitted. “It’s just, he’s too short to be an adult, and his voice always sounds like he’s trying to make himself sound older on purpose. He really seems like a young kid.”

Rio started washing the dishes again, but more slowly this time, pensively. “What are you going do about it?” she asked carefully.

Jefferson rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t know what I 

can

 do about it, really,” he admitted. “It doesn’t sit right with me to have a young kid out there fighting villains, but it’s not like I can just tell him to stop. I doubt he’d listen to me.”

Truthfully, up until just a few weeks ago, telling Spiderman to stop superheroing and having him listen would have been a dream come true for Jefferson. He’d never liked the vigilante and thought New York would be better off with justice left in the hands of qualified, accountable professionals. Now the same was still true, but for vastly different reasons.

“It’s just, being a superhero isn’t just fun and games. I saw his fight with Kingpin,” Jefferson continued, his mind flooding with memories of the event. “At one point, Kingpin knocked him down, and he didn’t get back up for nearly half a minute. It was terrifying, and that was with me just watching it. No kid should have to go through something like that.”

“I mean, the old Spiderman was still in high school when he first started,” Rio said quietly. “It’s not like this is something new, Jefferson.”

“Yeah, but-“ Jefferson sighed. “You know what he did, right after the fight? He hugged me and then told me he loved me. How am I supposed to interpret that? Especially now that I know how young he is?” 

A terrible thought suddenly struck him. “What if- what if the reason he acted that way towards me was that he was actually upset? He’s a child, maybe he actually was really scared during that fight.” He turned to Rio. “What if he was just trying to reach out to the only person nearby at the time?”

Rio’s look of surprise turned into a worried frown. “If he’s as young as you think he is, I wouldn’t be surprised. This was his first fight as far as we know of, after all.”

“God…” Jefferson pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers. “Does anyone else know about his identity? Is there anyone he can even talk to about all of this?” He started to pace. “How about his parents? Do they know how much danger he’s putting himself in?”

“The only one who can tell you all that is Spiderman, Jefferson,” Rio said helplessly.

“But how am I supposed to do that?” Jefferson said. “It’s not like I could just point blank ask Spiderman about his parents.”

“Do your parents know that you’re Spiderman?”

Spiderman froze and just stared at Jefferson, blinking a few times. Around them, people rushed around, cleaning up the wreckage that the latest villain had caused. “What?”

“I mean, uh-“ Jefferson stumbled. He hadn’t meant to just blurt it out like that. “This is a dangerous job. I’d think your parents would have a right to know that you’re out here risking your life so much. Do they know?”

“I- well, uh-“ Spiderman stammered, and his voice came out nervous. His whole body had tensed up, Jefferson realized.

Jefferson instantly backtracked. He didn’t want to scare the kid off. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry about your identity. It’s okay if you don’t want to answer.” He turned to leave.

“Wait.” Jefferson turned back to see Spiderman staring quizzically at him. “So you just genuinely want to know about my parents, because you don’t know? There’s no other reason?”

“Why would there be another reason?” Jefferson said, bemused.

“Oh. Wow. I mean, it’s nothing,” Spiderman corrected himself. He let out a nervous laugh. “I thought you were talking about something else.”

“O-kayy,” Jefferson said. The awkwardness of asking Spiderman a
