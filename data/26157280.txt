Chapter 1: Making the Ultimate Gamer (D.va, Her Simps)
    




Chapter Text

Nothing got Hana Song’s kitty purring like a hard fought battle that gave her ample opportunity to style on basic bitches. There was no greater joy in her life than intercepting predictable sniper shots or otherwise decisive attacks with her MEKA’s defense matrix. With her incredible APM, she always made sure to use her MEKA’s camera features to zoom in on things like Widowmaker’s face as she bit her bottom lip in frustration, adding it to her ever-growing folder of fap material. 

 

Her two favorites were videos, though, not pictures -- one of Sombra throwing a delightful little tantrum full of stomping feet, flailing arms and punched walls after Hana shot her translocator beacon out of the side. The other one was an angrily jiggling Roadhog after she took on his full Whole Hog maneuver. It would be the stuff of nightmares for most people, but for her it didn’t matter whether or not she was pissing off a world-renowned beauty or a fat fuck.

 

Half of her folder ended up being chat spam from online games accusing her of hacking or smurfing. Matches in Starcraft 2 and 3 were as real to her as her work in Overwatch. And that’s really all there was to it. Hana delighted in riling people up and denying them. It was her guilty pleasure, the secret little thing she’d used to get off in marathon masturbation sessions, chaining together multiple orgasms like her best multi-kills, holding her Hitachi to her bitchy little clit while her long, graceful fingers (of course covered in Doritos dust) spelunked her dripping pussy and virgin ass. Whenever she needed a break, she would just chug half a bottom of her Mountain Dew Game Fuel and get back to work.

 

It didn’t stay a secret forever, when her perverse mind and mounting libido started to lead her down the path of exhibitonism. She installed custom hardware on her MEKA that would deploy a small drone whenever her pussy began to moisten, automatically targeting whomever surely wanted to murder Hana. It would get right in their face and play a cartoonish hologram of her suit-clad legs spread wide open, only for her to suddenly bring her knees together when the drone blared out, “GET SONG-BLOCKED, SHITTER”.

 

Her team started to figure it out then.

Hana began to worry as her 20th birthday loomed its ugly head. When she turned twenty, she would no longer be a teen. She’d be old. Her skills would surely start to fade away. With how much she used them between gaming and piloting and just jilling off, carpal tunnel and arthritis would surely set in and she had no doubt her memes would soon thereafter lose any semblance of dankness.

 

She wasn’t really being rational about it. Anyone could tell her as much if she left her mother’s basement (of course she still lived there, they had great internet) and actually spoke to another human being about what worried her. Instead, she began to freak out. What would she do? What would the world do without its D.Va?

 

It dawned on her that she could just make a new D.Va. Sometimes people used their cocks and pussies for things other than masturbation. Sometimes they made new lives.

 

Whoa.

 

She hatched a plan. She would hold a gaming tournament unlike any other to decide the invite list for her birthday LAN. Once she had all the best gamers in the world gathered in one room, she’d fill her cock-hungry pussy with their jizz and ensure that once she hit 22 and basically had to retire, the world would already have a new D.Va in training. They wouldn’t be without her genius for long.

How she went about this was important, of course, and Hana spent countless hours researching porn to decide the optimal way to get bred in a gangbang. She rented out her favorite net cafe for the debaucherous extravaganza. On the night of her fertilization, she waited naked in the cafe’s backroom, watching her favorite denials and getting her pussy ready for the absolute gauntlet it was about to go through. It felt important to her that she not be the first one to cum at her party, so she always stopped herself right on the edge and instead watched one of Dr. Ziegler’s lectures for a few minutes, letting it bore her out and wind her down just a bit.

 

After an hour, she figured her prospective baby daddies would be warmed up and ready to grace her divine (for gamers, anyway) womb with their unworthy seed and create the ultimate gamer. She nudged the door ajar and crawled out into the dark shop, her teen body sleek and supple despite her incredibly unhealthy diet of Cool Ranch Doritos and Flaming Hot Cheetos; she only wore her headphones, listening to what she considered the most epic songs from Blizzard’s audio library for this occasion.
