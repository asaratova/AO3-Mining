Chapter Text
Chapter 1: Close CallLoki of Asgard ran into his bedroom excitedly, he had to get changed into warmer clothes if he wanted to go to Jotunheim. His plan was working better than he ever thought it would! All he had hoped was for Odin to hear Thor whining like a child about how unfair his life was. Now however Thor was leaping over the invisible line! He had insisted that they go to Jotunheim against Odin’s direct orders to confront Laufey!Loki could sing he was so gleeful. Thor would not ascend the throne anytime soon for this stunt, and Asgard would be safe from his idiotic rule for a few centuries more. It wasn’t that Loki wanted the throne he just didn’t think Thor was ready to take it. Odin would never hear a word against Thor so Loki had to be cunning.He found a way to open a portal between Jotunheim and Asgard’s weapons vault to allow the frost giants immediate access to the Casket of Ancient Winters.Loki pulled on warmer trousers and a warm vest before he pulled on his warm fleece lined coat. He was ready to go. All he had to do was ensure that they never made it to Laufey and all would be well, he approached one of the guards outside his rooms.“Guard, my brother and his friends have decided to go to Jotunheim, I am accompanying them. Watch us, once we leave the palace run and inform Odin of our whereabouts do you understand?”“Yes my prince.” The Guard bowed.Loki smiled and walked quickly to the stables.**********************************************************************************Odin was in Frigga’s rooms ranting about Thor’s behaviour after the failed coronation.“You would think that after all the time and energy we put into raising a king we would have one!” he grumbled angrily, Frigga just shook her head disdainfully.“Well husband he is our son, we should have expected this.”Odin rounded on her with an ugly expression marring his features. Frigga flinched and jumped back a bit nervously. Odin immediately knelt in front of her and held her hands tenderly.“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to frighten you….” He murmured softly.Frigga felt herself relaxing again and Odin smiled kindly at her. He stroked her hands comfortingly.“What shall we do about Thor?” Frigga asked quietly.“I don’t know, it was a show of temper which I believe he meant to impress me. He is a boy, he will learn in the next few years to temper himself. I will not punish him for it; he will simply have to wait for the throne a little longer.” Odin sighed and wrapped his arms around her waist, he rested his head on her breasts and Frigga ran her fingers through his hair.“I am glad my husband, Thor is a foolish boy but he means well. He could never disobey us with malicious or spiteful intent.” Frigga smiled as Odin nodded in response.“Yes I-”“My king and queen! The prince’s and their companions have gone to Jotunheim to confront the frost giants!” the guard who raced into Frigga’s chambers was a young recruit who had been stationed outside of Loki’s chambers.Frigga stared in shock as her husband used magic to summon his armour onto his body and rushed from her rooms. She shook her head nervously; hopefully he would find the boys before Laufey did.**********************************************************************************Loki’s second plan hadn’t gone as he hoped. They had somehow arrived in Jotunheim before Odin could catch up to them. Naturally Thor led them into Laufey’s palace and confronted the king.“How did your people get into Asgard?” Thor boomed angrily.“The house of Odin is full of traitors…” Laufey purred quietly.“Do not dishonour my father’s name with your lies!” Thor shouted at the king furiously.“You father is a murderer and a thief! If you knew the true extent of damage he has wrought here you would be ashamed to be his son!” Laufey towered over them suddenly.His face softened slightly. “You know not what your actions will unleash. I do. Go now while I still allow it.”Loki slid forwards quietly. “We will accept your most gracious offer king Laufey. Come Thor.”Loki was sure the look Thor shot at him was colder than the realm around them and he shivered before turning and walking back to his brothers friends.“Run back home lil princess.” Thrym murmured playfully, grinning at Thor.The eldest son of Odin grinned and swung mjolnir straight into the giants chest. Chaos broke out.Loki rushed to create his doppelgangers to confuse the beasts while Thor and his friends set about bashing the giants skulls in. Laufey it seemed had called up a beast through the ice to kill them and Loki watched in horror as it ran straight at him. He ducked and the beast jumped onto a frost giant who had been ambushing him. Loki turned and stared in disgust as the claws
