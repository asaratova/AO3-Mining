Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Steve was filthy, sore, exhausted, and very hungry. One of the side effects of the super serum was an insanely fast metabolism, which required fuel on a regular basis. This mission hadn’t really allowed for that, and his body was threatening to start cannibalizing itself soon. At his side, Bucky slumped in a debriefing room chair. His feet were propped up on the table, and Bucky was pointedly ignoring the multiple scowls aimed his way. He was dirtier than Steve, if that was possible, and probably even more tired. But there was an inner calmness about him that hadn’t been there before. Having a job, a purpose, suited Bucky. Without it, he tended to be hyper agitated, restless, or depressed.Many of the S.H.I.E.L.D agents very clearly did not trust Bucky, and weren’t shy about how they felt. Steve worried at first, but when it became clear that Bucky didn’t give a shit, he stopped worrying as much. It didn’t stop him from glaring furiously if someone made a nasty comment, and Captain America’s disapproval was enough to prevent some rough times. Clint and Natasha’s disapproval was even more potent, and both Avenger agents made it clear that they trusted Bucky. Still, Steve worried. They hadn’t been able to find out who had been behind the kidnapping and detaining fiasco yet, and Steve had no desire to have his best friend reprogrammed into an unthinking assassin, again. Bucky’s performance during Darcy’s rescue illustrated that his skills were still there, and could be accessed when needed, but the last thing either of them wanted was to see those skills put to use only for assassination. Bucky would kill when necessary. He’d told Steve and Darcy that much, after a long heart to heart following Darcy’s rescue. After all, he’d done it while a member of the Howling Commandos. He just didn’t want to be used, against his will, as an emotionless assassin. A killing machine. 	They had gone back to a slightly uneasy peace all together. After the fiasco with Darcy’s kidnapping, Stark had offered them an apartment in one of the buildings he owned. Ever since he’d become Iron Man, the billionaire had started collecting properties around the world, owned in a corporate name that he was pretty sure could not be traced back to him, just to have safe places to stay. And since S.H.I.E.L.D, or the World Security Council, was screwing things up, Tony thought that Steve might not want it known where he was.Steve didn’t want to owe a debt of any kind to Stark, but he also didn’t want S.H.I.E.L.D to be able to knock on his door and shoot him with tranquilizers again when he opened it. Plus, their old apartment was trashed. Bucky had destroyed the floor in the closet of his old room, and S.H.I.E.L.D had put metal bolts through the living room floor. And there were bullet holes in the walls. It was a mess. Upon being cleared by medical and returning to the apartment, Darcy had taken a quick tour, and had laughingly declared that they weren’t getting their security deposit back.But any decision would have to include Bucky, because Steve had no intention of letting him go off by himself again. He shouldn’t have allowed it in the first place, but he wanted to respect Bucky’s decisions. Then again, when coming back to yourself after being programmed to be an assassin, after almost dying, well, maybe those decisions had been compromised. So after Bucky recovered from his gunshot wound with a little help from Stark’s medical team, Steve and Darcy sat down with him to discuss things. They didn’t want to be separated from him again. Bucky reluctantly admitted the same thing, even though he also didn’t really want to be the ‘fifth wheel’, whatever that meant. Basically, living with a couple made him uncomfortable.  Steve sort of understood why. Back in the day, pre-serum, Bucky had regularly brought girls home to the tiny apartment he shared with Steve. Steve had gotten quite a second-hand education at that time, and it was uncomfortable. But with the size of apartments nowadays, it wasn’t as much of an issue. There was plenty of room to avoid hearing and seeing things. And Bucky admitted that being by himself was a bad thing. Too much time to think. He also did not want S.H.I.E.L.D easily able to find them, so supported the move idea. Fury hadn’t been pleased when he found out Steve was moving himself and Bucky to an undisclosed location. He’d even gone so far as to have the S.H.I.E.L.D HR department call Steve to get the new address, for ‘payroll purposes’. Steve was ready for that though, and had a PO Box address to give them, that was registered through Stark’s company. Stark thought of everything. He was surprisingly helpful.The moving itself had been a masterpiece of Stark’s cleverness to outwit S.H.I.E.L.D’s best. Steve still chuckled when he thought about it. It had been effective.  S.H.I.E.L.D didn’t know where they were. It was driving Fury nuts. But Fury wasn’t the one Steve was worried about. Whoever ha
