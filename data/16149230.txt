Chapter 1: Face-Sitting
    


Summary:

Face-SittingGavin/RK900





Chapter Text
Living with Detective Reed was like living with a particularly ill-mannered house cat, RK900 decided as he picked up the phone, packet of bills, and leftover Chinese takeout Gavin had flung off the counter in his latest rage. It never took much to set him off, usually something small, like RK missing some social cue, standing too close, or suggesting he eat something besides instant ramen or leftovers. Inevitably, their tiffs ended in Gavin shouting and fleeing the scene, and then RK waiting until he calmed down to try to smooth things over. 
 
So he waited about fifteen minutes, long enough for the detective to have a good sulk, then went after him. Gavin's bedroom was always a mess, clothes scrunched up under the sparse furniture, empty Red Bulls on all available surfaces. In the middle of the garbage, Gavin sat on his mattress on the floor. He obviously heard RK enter, but was making a point of not looking at him. That wouldn't do. 
 
RK sat beside him, cool and patient as ever, not making any moves. If Gavin wanted him to go away, he'd have to acknowledge his presence first. 
 
	“Did I say you could come in? Fuck off.” 
 
	RK thought he looked like a kid in a treehouse, keeping his parents out of his secret fortress. “I'm sorry I've upset you.”
 
	“You're upsetting me now. Go away.”
 
	“I think we should talk,” he said. He knew exactly how this would go, how it always went. They didn't talk. It wasn't how they worked together. Gavin still wasn't looking at him, so he chanced a small smirk. 
 
	“I don't want to talk,” Gavin said through gritted teeth.
 
	It was, for lack of a better word, robotic how things played out. RK would say he was sorry, Gavin wouldn't want to talk, and they'd fall into bed together. Like clockwork. “What do you want to do instead, Detective?” he asked. 
 
	And there they were, RK pressed against him, hips forcing Gavin's down into the mattress. Gavin's stubble scraped RK's synthetic smooth cheek. He kept trying to hook his leg around RK's to flip them over, and finally, RK let him. Gavin ground himself against the other man's crotch, hissing from the friction. RK could see the wet patch spreading across his sweatpants. “Take them off,” he ordered. His tone softened, “I want to try something.”
 
	Gavin shivered, but nodded. 
 
	RK lay back on the pillow, gesturing for Gavin to come closer. 
 
	His eyebrows shot up, but for once, he didn't argue. “You want me to ride your face?”
 
	One curt nod.
 
	“Fuck yeah.” He straddled RK's eager mouth, thighs on either side of the android's face. Sweat beaded along the back of his neck. “You ready?”
 
	Instead of answering, RK grabbed his waist and pulled him down so his face could bury between his legs. Gavin tasted sweet and bitter, like the coffee he drank far too much of. RK couldn't get enough. Working his tongue in slow sweeps, he was gratified to hear Gavin start cursing. 
 
	As Gavin started a slow swivel of his hips, RK took hold of his ass, parting him further so he could drive deeper. He pointed his tongue, plunging in and out, before pulling back and licking a long, gentle swipe. 
 
	It drove Gavin mad, made him tremble and grind down harder. One of the benefits of--dating? fucking?--an android was that he didn't need to breathe. He just powered through. Then his tongue came up to circle the base of his dick, and Gavin grabbed his hair. 
 
	RK's entire body jolted. With his higher pain tolerance and fewer pleasure sensors, he needed things to get pretty extreme before they turned him on. That certainly did it. His hips canted up into empty air. A low rumbling moan tore from his mouth, vibrating through the man above him. Gavin jumped. “Oh, holy fuck.”
 
	RK reached up until he felt Gavin's jaw. He held out two fingers. Gavin seemed to get the idea, since he took them deep into his mouth, twisting his tongue around them. RK did his best to mimic the motion with his tongue, which only served to make Gavin shake. 
 
	He hummed as he brought his fingers back down to Gavin's ass. As he circled his hole, he moved his head up a little, laving his tongue across the head of Gavin's dick. He was rewarded with another tug on his hair. Gavin throbbed in his mouth. He sucked lightly, still swirling his tongue, and Gavin screamed. His hips were rocking at a desperate pace now, leaving a slick mess from RK's chin to the bridge of his nose. It was all he could do to keep up, humming and thrusting his tongue in tandem. He ached for contact, still fully dressed. Rutting against nothing wasn't helping the problem, but Gavin's needs came first. It was all part of the apology. He thrust his fingers while french kissing the head of his dick. 
 
	Gavin death-gripped his hair, making RK moan against him, and that was enough to push him over the edge. He rocked through his orgasm, whispering, “Fuck, fuck, oh shit” under his breath, while RK didn't stop licking and sucking f
