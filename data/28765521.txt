Chapter Text
NATASHA POV:A lot had happened in the past week. The day we got back to the compound has been a fairly easy day. Wanda and I got settled in the compound and we trained for the first time in a long time. It had been a long day for Wanda so I wasn't surprised when she started to fall asleep during the movie. I felt her relaxing further and further into my side and I whispered, "I love you my sweet, little witch." I felt her tense next to me before she relaxed again and whispered back, "I love you too." She then turned her body so she could lay her head on my chest. She slowly drifted off to sleep and by the time the movie was over, she was in a deep sleep. I had carried her back to her room but she wouldn't let go of my shirt so I laid down next to her. It was the first time in a long time that she didn't have a nightmare. The next several days were nice. Wanda was in a good mood which was great to see. We would train very lightly each day, just to get Wanda used to moving around again and starting to condition her. She still had the tube in and I was trying to get her off of it sooner rather than later. She had had this tube for almost two weeks which meant that we were going to need to change it soon. I was not looking forward to having to place it again but I was going to have to if we didn't get her eating full meals again. Steve, Tony and I would try to get her to eat more and more at each meal but the most we had gotten her to eat was two pieces of buttered bread with an orange. That was huge compared to most of her other meals. We could sometimes get her to eat a bowl of cereal but then she would refuse to eat anything else until she did a training session. I knew that it was just her mind trying to assure her that she wasn't offering her body nutrients but it was upsetting nonetheless. It was the sixth day at the compound when Wanda surprised me. She had had a rough night from another nightmare but when she walked into the kitchen, she grabbed two frozen waffles out of the freezer and on her way to put them in the toaster, she made an announcement, "I am done with the feeding tube." I set my coffee cup down and looked at her, waiting to see if anything followed that statement. She put the two waffles in the toaster and pulled out an orange which she started peeling. She also went over to the coffee maker and poured herself a cup of coffee. I stared at her in disbelief. She had gone from eating a piece of bread, a small bowl of grapes, and a dinner roll the day before to eating a full breakfast the next. The waffles finished in the toaster and she pulled them out and lathered them in peanut butter. She then sat down at the table and quickly ate all of the food. She didn't seem upset which was good but I had a feeling that there was a reason for this sudden need to eat, I just didn't know if I wanted to question her about it yet. "Wanda?" I asked as soon as she had finished all of her food and got up to leave. "Yeah Nat?" "Is there a reason why you just ate an entire breakfast?" I was slightly nervous that Wanda was in some kind of trance and that my comment would make her snap out of it and freak out but she stayed calm as she looked at me. She shrugged, "I'm just done with the tube. If I eat today, can we take the tube out?" I was trying to think of what we had talked about recently and if any of it would contribute to this sudden change. Maybe she really was just ready to get back to normal?"Um, maybe not today but if you eat that well, then we can very soon." I knew that one day of good eating was not going to guarantee another day of good eating so I wanted to take it slow. "Okay, can we go train now?" Something about her seemed off but not necessarily in a bad way. It almost seemed like she was reading off of a script and that she was hiding something but she didn't seem upset so I let it go. "Sure, let me just go get changed really
