So it was the 4th of July. America’s Independence Day. The ultimate American experience for some. But for you, it was spent, unfortunately, on a mission, with Steve. Now, it wasn’t unfortunate because of Steve. No. It was unfortunate because Steve was doing this on his birthday. You tried to convince him you could do it on your own but he refused. You made Bucky attempt to tell him he could come along if he was needed but he still refused.Which is why were annoyed right now. You were planning on giving Steve a fantastic birthday gift. It was now or never. You harbored a crush on him for a while now, and had to pretend everyday that he was just a friend.But he was more than that. Much much more. So you were going to confess.But then this happened.I mean it wasn’t the worst idea either. You had to go undercover as a couple to a party. It was simple really. Get some information from the daughter of a HYDRA general. It would be so easy. Lucky for you, she was not interested in Steve. She was not interested in men at all. So all you needed to do was distract her a little, get her to walk to a room with you, and go home.Walking out to the car Tony lent you, Steve’s jaw dropped once he saw your attire. For some reason, his pants felt just a little too tight.“Y/N t-that’s some  dress you got there.” He pointed at you, too shy to look up at you, knowing very well you caught him checking you out.“So glad you like it babe.” You kissed his cheek, making him blush even more.Oh man. He was America’s Golden Boy.“W-what was that for?” He finally looked at you, marveling at how beautiful you looked, even with simple your make-up.“Well we are going as a couple right? Better get used to it from now.”He opened the door for you, and you caught the hitch in his breath once he saw the back of your dress.Walking, more like sprinting to his side, he sat down and started the engine.“That’s some dress you picked out.”“You said that already Soldier.” Not expecting to hear that, he pressed harder on the gas, making you chuckle at his reaction.“So uhhh, how do I-where can I touch you when we’re...you know..when I’m leading you around?” He avoided looking at you, knowing very well he would lose it. Leaning towards him, you whispered in his ears. “Anywhere you like Captain. It is your birthday after all.” Sitting back, you saw his jaw clench at your tone.You were driving the poor man insane. But it was so much fun, knowing very well how he was affected by your actions.“You sure about that doll?” He tried to control his voice, failing at how desperate he sounded.“For you Captain, always.” His resolve was breaking slowly. You noticed how he always reacted when you called him by his rank.Maybe it was a kink? You were going to test that theory later in the night.An hour later, Steve pulled up to the hotel. He was on the verge of losing it at this point. You spent the entire time teasing him with your feather-light touches and your flirty tone.Oh how much he wanted to hear you giggle again. It drove him mad.Well, two can play at that game.Opening the door for you, he grabbed your hand and pulled you a little harder than he intended, making you stumble and grab on his shoulder for support. He supported your back, and you wished he didn’t hear you moan at the warmth of his hand on your skin.But he did.And he smiled at your reaction.“You ok doll?”You looked up at him and smiled. “Never better.”Leading you towards the door, you were welcomed with a woman, in her hand a list of the guests.“Good evening. Who might be the young couple?” She looked towards Steve, taking a step towards him.“Steve Rogers and Y/N L/N.” You answered her, leaning towards Steve. Since when were you this jealous? She turned towards you, giving a shady smile and jotting you down.“Enjoy our evening C-““Thank you.” You started walking, ignoring the look she gave you, making Steve smile at your actions.“At ease.” He whispered in your ears, the smell of his cologne making you shiver.“I am.” You turned to look at him, regretting it immediately. The once baby blue eyes were gone, his dark pupils taking over completely.You hated the effect he was having on you. What happened to the shy Steve?Walking through the crowds, Steve was recognized more and more, with people wanting to take pictures with him and completely ignoring your presence. You left his side, looking for your target and finding her at the bar.Sitting not too far away, you ordered a vodka martini and looked towards her, winking when she smiled at you.“That’ll be on me.” She said to the guy putting the drink in front of you.“You shouldn’t have.” You smiled, licking your lips seductively after taking a sip.“Well, with that dress, I should.” She sat closer to you, grazing your arm.“April von Strucker.” She held out her hand.“Y/N L/N. It’s an honor to finally meet you.” You hoped she didn’t see you walking in with Rogers.“You here with someone?” She inquired, making you shift in your seat.“Ya. But he’s ignoring me
