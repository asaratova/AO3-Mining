Chapter 1: Tired
    




Chapter Text
Tired, Tony felt tired, from the second Ste… Rogers left with his bestie all the murderous rage just abandoned him. The adrenaline rush ceased and all the pain came. His head hurt, his arm hurt and his chest absolutely throbbed with pain (a broken sternum could do that). Also he just realised how cold it was and being in an iron coffin didn’t help. 
The suit weighted too much to sustain and gravity brought him down. 
Years of friendship, of trust, years of being a supposed family, they were all lies. He thought he had a family and he lost them, no, not lost, they left him. What was Clint even doing there? Wasn’t he retired? 
His breathing was ragged. He definitely had at least a couple of broken ribs, mabye a punctured lung.
All left but Rhodey and Vision, who were paralized and heart-broken respectively. Even Pepper couldn’t deal with him anymore. Wow, now that was a pity party.
He started tasting iron on the back of his throat.
He felt utterly alone, betrayed, hurt and kinda guilty. But most of all, he just felt tired. Tired of doing the betrayal thing all over again, tired of having his trust shoved in his face, again, tired of having to get up and fix it, again, tired of this routine of broken trust, just tired of living a life full of betrayal and loneliness. Pain seemed to be his most loyal companion since Howard first hit him.
The cold clawed its way up his body. He needed to get out of the suit… something like five minutes before.
Was he doomed to have his trust broken or was it just faith having a sense of humor? Maybe he even deserved it, maybe he just had it coming for expecting mutual respect and trust. Geez, It felt like Obie all over again.
He couldn’t feel the tip of his right hand anymore.
The realization hit him like like a truck: he was alone. Nobody knew where he was, St… Rogers and his boyfriend left, his kittines was probably gone too (yeah he knew Garfield was there, thank you very much, but hey they could have used a paw against Zemo so…, also, he kinda liked the guy), the suit couldn’t fly or call for help, he was alone. Tony Stark was going to die silently without anyone noticing. He would have laughed at the irony of it if it wasn’t for the blood half choking him.
With the suit down the only way to reach the relise button was through sheer force, but the suit’s arm weighed too much and he… he was stuck.
Man had he messed up bad this time. He thought about closing his eyes for good. He was so tired. God was he tired. Maybe he could just sleep for awhile. Wasn’t that a bad idea with a concussion? Wouldn’t he risk dying? would that be such a bad thing? Did it hurt? Mabye it wouldn’t hurt if he was sleeping. Mabye he could just lay there and pass out. Mabye for once in his life he would be lucky. 
So he just lay there until sleep or death finally claimed him (he didn’t know wich, only that he was embraced by lovely darkness).

He woke up with a start, darkness all around him, pain and cold deep inside his veins. His tired eyes moved around, only to be met by silence and shadows.
He must be dead, and this must be hell, or something.
He lay back down
“So this is the great Iron Man? Tony ‘fucking’ Stark I presume” the woman’s voice didn’t sound impressed. He opened his eyes and saw the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Her skin was olive dark, in contrast with her light blue, almost white, eyes, her light brown hair fell in a waterfall of curls on her back and her lips were full and white. Her cheekbones were sharp as knifes. Her body tall and majestic. But he was too tired to smile or comment about it, so he just layed there and stared at her, his face blank giving nothing away.
“The one and only” he tiredly answered. She looked down on him and then offered her hand. He took it. Her hand was freezing cold but he was used to that at this point, how many hours was he concious in freakin Siberia before he fell asleep (because this must be a dream)? One? Two? Five?.
“Six and a half” she responded, apparently reading his mind. Yep, definitely a dream. “No, it isn’t”
“Ok, that’s creeping me out, could you just… not do that?” He asked, voice wavering just a little.
“As you desire” was her response, but he was sure she was still reading his mind. A small satisfied smile made its way on her face, probably a response to his latest thought. Her smile grew wider.
“Who are you and what do you want from me?” He inquired, letting his curiosity show.
“Why do you think I want something from you?” She wondered.
“Everyone does. So, what is it?” He demanded a bit impatient.
At that she took a moment to observe him. After a few seconds or so, she finally answered his question. “I want you to reunite the Avengers.” He looked at her like she was crazy, wich she probably was if he was being honest with himself. Half of them were in prison, another two were fugitives, and the last two were broken. And then there
