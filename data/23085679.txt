Tony was exhausted.He’d been exhausted for so long that he couldn’t really remember what it felt like to not constantly have pins and needles in his eyes, to not have his shoulders tense and his back locked up.The past few weeks had been a mess of constant meetings, deadlines, press conferences… just the thought of having to deal with another person of any kind that were not his children right now might actually send him over the edge and turn him into a disgusting sobbing mess.He took a sip of his… he had no clue # coffee of today. The scent alone made him want to vomit and the caffeine hit him in all the wrong ways.But he needed it. Because today he would be meeting with the Accords Council, and then with the Avengers, and then he had an interview… and that deadline Pepper had given him, the meeting for the project with defense, and then the gala.It was not even 6 in the morning and he already knew that he was lucky if he could get home before 2 in the morning tomorrow.He’d sleep of a few hours on the jet (not his own bed for the umpteenth time that month) and… no he wouldn’t make the deadline if he did that…He rubbed his eyes and his vision swam. “You’re ok. Everything’s going to be ok.” He mumbled to himself. Just think about meeting #1 of today.Most people dealing with depression as heavy as Tony had been in for months now would live from day to day. Tony lived from meeting to meeting. That made him think of the fact that he had called off his appointment with his therapist again. The doctor had not been happy and had insisted that they make another appointment right away. The way things were going now he’d have to call her off again.His phone buzzed.Time to go.````````````````````````````````````The Accord’s meeting went about as well as it had gone since pretty much day one.People angerly and passive aggressively kept interrupting him. He was being used as the messenger boy for the Avengers. And these people did not care that he was the messenger, they were just happy to have a target to shoot at.It wasn’t as if he could convince any of the Avengers to come with him, so they can explain their concerns. No, that was Tony’s job, because what else did he do? Besides house them, equip them with gear, maintain said gear, act as liaison between the Avengers and everyone else, fund them, be a heavy hitter on 90% of their missions, and so much more.Just thinking of it made Tony’s shoulders sag.The Accord’s committee saw it apparently as an opportunity to hack into him even more.Tony just tuned the rest of the meeting out and kept his mouth shut. If he spoke once more, he would either cry, throw up or start screaming. Not even screaming words, just scream the noise that had been stuck in the back of his throat for months now.``````````````````````````````````“What do you mean, ‘you weren’t able to discuss all topics’? Tony this is important! This is out future we’re talking about.” Steve angerly exclaims.Tony closes his eyes for a second. “I know-”“I’m not finished!” Steve yells. “How could you be so irresponsible?! There are reasons we have these meetings, Tony! They’re not just for show. We need these issues worked out, and if you keep working against us…” Steve shakes his head.Steve is not the only one that’s furious with him. They all are. Even though the points that they want him to put pressure on do not have priority right not. Or even make any sort of sense. They’re in the middle of a dick measuring contest and Steve wants Tony to prove he’s the biggest.Tony doesn’t even agree with most of the changes that the Avengers want him to make, but he’s constantly overruled by the dictatorship that Steve has set up in the team.“Steve if you, or anyone, would come with me-” Tony tries for the hundredth time.Clint cuts him off with a sneer, as expected. “Just like you to cut corners, Stark. Just pull you fucking weight for once! And stop whining about it like a little spoilt bitch!”Steve doesn’t tell him he can’t be that crude, that he can’t talk to Tony like that. No, because Tony’s the only one that counts for. Tony’s there to be their punching bag after all.“Tony if you could just forget your ego for a second and focus on what’s important.”`````````````````````````````````````When the ‘meeting’ with the Avengers is over and done with, and they feel like he’s been chewed out enough, he tells them he has to leave for his interview.They all look disgusted with him, and tell him that it’s awful that he can’t even make time for them to properly have a meeting because he needs his 10 minutes of fame again. Even though it’s and interview that was meant for the team but they are all refusing to go to.Tony doesn’t reply to any of their jabs and just picks up his tablet and leaves the room.And if he’s late to the interview because he had to make a pit stop at the bathroom to throw up an unholy amount of coffee, then no one is there to notice.````````````````````````````````````The interviewer is, in a word,
