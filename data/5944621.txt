Chapter 1: Bubblebath Bitch - STEVE ROGERS/MALE READER
    




Chapter Text
Another long hard day at the office is over and all you look forward to today is a long hot bath. You need to forget about the stacks of paperwork still sitting on your desk, waiting to be filled out and processed. They always tell you how fun it is to be the hero, to swing around blocks, run through the streets and bask in the glory. But while Cap and Co. are out there, defending the Everyday Man from danger, most of Shield, you included, are stuck inside, trying to tidy up the mess they leave behind. Working at HQ was a definite wake-up call that brought you back to reality. Now you know how much additional property damage the Avengers cause during their fights, how much some of them have to suffer and how mundane they actually are. Hell, one time you saw Clint and Nat trying to buy snacks from the vending machine like normal people. You test the water with your toe tip – just the right temperature.You unbuckle your belt, slip out of your shirt and underwear, throwing them in the washing machine. Slowly you climb inside the tub, the warm water feeling nice against your soft skin. The tension of a 12 hour shift leaving your body as you sink back and relax. Vanilla and lemon grass smells float around the steamy room as you play with the foam before you decide to rest your eyes, just for a second. The sound of your front door being shut and keys being thrown onto the coffee table in your living room shake you from your accidental nap. He's home. You think, and you can't help but to smile."Honey, you home?", he asks, almost like in one of those cheesy 50's sitcoms.You deliberately ignore him. You want him to look for you. To come into the bathroom. To see you like this."Babe?", he knocks on the door. Slowly he opens it. "There you are. Why didn't you say anything?", Steve chuckles, sitting down next to the bathtub. You pull him in for a kiss – just a long peck on the lips, no tongue but somehow that much more intimacy. "Wanted it to be a surprise," you whisper in return. Even though your eyes are closed you know he's smiling, you can feel it against your lips."Did you have a hard day at work?", he asks, pulling up the sleeves of his flannel, his eyes locked with yours, your foreheads still touching. That's what you love about Steve. How he can come home from fighting the fight and still make it all about you whenever you need it. Like he knows when exactly you crave for his attention. "Mhm," you nod, almost exploding with anticipation of what's to come. "You're so tense," he states, sinking his right hand underwater, his left one gripped hard around the ledge of the tub to steady himself. "Let me help you with that. Can I help you with that?", he asks, his face now nuzzled against your neck, his scent – sweat and sandal wood – dizzying you. Your mouth goes dry and all you can get out is a silent whimper, which he learned to interpret as a yes. And just like that his fingers are where you want them, grazing over your bulging dick, making your breath hitch. Steve's movements are slow and calculated. He knows how to take you apart and he loves to do it slowly. "You like that, baby?", he mouths against your ear, his tongue rolling against your earlobe. "You want me inside?", he teases, pressing harder, rubbing faster, as you pant and squirm under his touch. You're gripping the rim of the bathtub hard, knuckles white as you try to control yourself. You know what a kick Steve gets out of seeing you break like this but you also know how much he loves it when you try to keep it together, fight back.Steve grips you by the neck with his dry hand and pulls you in for another kiss. This time it's sloppy, needy, all teeth and tongue. The Steve from before gone, replaced with a more vicious self. "I know you want me inside baby," A kiss against your jaw, a lick at your neck, "Just say it." Steve's frustration shows but you know he won't put his fingers inside before you ask him to. You might as well tease him a bit longer. Or at least for as long as your own body will allow you. "I think I'm good," you joke through clenched teeth, your eyes playful, challenging."Oh I know you are," he says wickedly, withdrawing his hand from your dick. Your breath hitches again but this time it's in panic. You're afraid he might actually stop right here and now because if there's one thing you learned about the Supersoldier Serum effects is that Steve doesn't only have perseverance but can also show a lot of restraint if he needs to. "But so am I." At this point he's not even touching you anymore. He's just playing with the last bits of foam floating above the surface.Giving up you grab his hand and pull it close to your mouth. Steve's eyes follow your every move, and he watches you as you suck on one, two, three of his fingers, your tongue tickling him, his skin probably prickling with excitement by now. You see him swallow hard and readjust a very noticeable bulg
