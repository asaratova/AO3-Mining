Chapter 1: Starfire.
Peter walked home slowly, the streets of New York so familiar to him thof he could walk home blindfolded. He had decided to take a break from the hero gig for a little while, having worked out a deal with the X men who were visiting to patrol for him. He really needed to rest once in awhile and going head to head with someone like electro or Rhino wouldn't help
He turned round the block thinking to be home when all he saw was an unfamiliar street. This wasn't supposed to be.....WAIT A MINUTE!!! He turned back to see the ripples of dark blue energy, a portal of some kind, closing. 
He sighed. Well SHIT!!! He was trapped in another Universe. Again. 
###################################################################
Peter looked to be a crappy, almost slum like area. He could still tell he was in New York. Or atlleast this universe's version of it. The walls of the neighbourhood were covered in graffiti and curse words and he felt sure this was a ghetto. He would need a place to stay the night though. He saw four figures sitting on the sidewalk and walked towards them. And was promptly shocked and embarrassed when he got near enough to see them and their clothes or lack of them thereof. They were prostitutes. 
But there were some of the most beautiful and sexiest prostitutes he had ever seen. 
They all wore heels and some slutty clothing, their hair and makeup done perfectly. Their huge breasts were on full display, no bra whatsoever to keep them out of sight. What surprised him was what they were doing as they waited for a client to pick them up for the night. 
One of them, a blonde with her hair done in pigtails was one of the first to grab his attention. Her huge tits jiggled up and down at her current actions. Her whole left arm was covered in tattoos and right at the entrance to her bare pussy (she wasnâ€™t wearing any panties) were words tattooed In Black ink. They read "Fertile bitch". This though is not what got peters attention. No. It was the concrete wall that the woman was punching on that did. And she didn't even seem to get hurt.
One of the women, who possessed slightly pale skin and purple hair sat crossed leg on the sidewalk, her purple painted lips unmoving as she concentrated on the purple flame in her hand, whose flames showed of her huge tits ans slutty bare fishnet outfit.
A lady whose hair literally seemed to be moving flame and whose eyes glowed a shining green was counting some money in one hand as her brown tits jiggled as she fingered her wet pussy deeply much to her pleasure. A nearby crow whose cawing disturbed the night was heat with a blast of energy from the girl's juice soaked hand as muttered disgustedly about stupid birds.
And finally the last who quite literally was emerald. Or at least had an emerald skintone. For an moment even Peter thought it was his old teammate and fellow hero She hulk. No such luck. The ladie's hair was a deep red and her pouty lips smoked on a cigarette before passing a glance at her companions and quite literally turning into one of them at will before turning back to herself as she kneaded her green tits in one hand and looked around desperately. 
These ladies were superheroes. And their Names were Cassie sandsmark (Wonder girl), Raven, Koriand'r (Starfire) and Megan Marzz (Martian girl) respectively. All members of the superhero team, Young justice. 
Though Peter didn't notice this or know it for any matter. There weren't from his own universe anyway. The four stopped their actions as soon as they saw him.
"Well, well, well. Look at what the cat dragged in ladies." Purred Cassie, as she walked up to Peter. The other girls surrounded Peter as they began pushing their firm tits into his body. Megan had a lithe green hand on his crotch and was stroking his inflating length. "Oh! Girls, we got a big one hear. I feel about nine a half right hear." She said excitedly as the other girls gasped at this information. 
"Well he's mine. We took a coin toss and I won, remember? So I get him." Said Starfire, her purple lipstick painted lips watered with saliva as she licked them in anticipation of a hard pounding. The other girls groaned but agreed the fact. Peter himself was just as confused. "Hey wait a minute, I just wanted to know where to get a room for the night." He said hurriedly. The girls laughed. 
"Oh ain't that cute? Honey, with a dick like that, you'll have a place to sleep in every night and food for that tummy as well but they ain't no room in this part of the world. Are you new? This is suicide sector. The slums. Ain't nothing here but drugs, prostitutes and whores. All we got is alleyways and abandoned buildings. We 6 days journey from the rich part of the city. Ya' know? Where all those thin prick, well to do people of the city live. Though none of that matters when they travel six days to get
