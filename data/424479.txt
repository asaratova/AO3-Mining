FRIEND BRUCE, I HAVE NOTICED OF LATE THAT YOU APPEAR TO BE UNDER SOME STRESS. CAN I ASSIST IN ANY WAY?- Thor You’re very observant. What gave it away? The fact I single-handedly destroyed Connecticut last weekend or the way I now only have one pair of unripped trousers in my closet?- Bruce YOU DID NOT EAT YOUR CROISSANT AT BREAKFAST TODAY, NOR YESTERDAY.- Thor That would do it, yeah.- Bruce I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU SOME TRADITIONAL ASGARDIAN JOKES BY WAY OF RETURNING YOU TO A STATE OF MERRIMENT.- Thor That’s not necessary, really. I’ll just blow something up. I’ll be fine. Really.- Bruce WHY DID ODIN KILL THE LITTLE BOY?- Thor Oh Jesus. I don’t know, why?- Bruce BECAUSE HE WAS A FROST GIANT.- Thor Not seeing the punchline to that one. Sorry. Maybe try another one?- Bruce BUT THAT IS ONE OF OUR FINEST, MOST HUMOROUS JOKES!- Thor ALL RIGHT. HERE IS ANOTHER; WHY DID ODIN KILL THE MAIDSERVANT?- Thor Hmm. I don’t know. Tell me.- Bruce BECAUSE SHE WAS A FROST GIANT.- Thor Is that really what passes for humour on Asgard? Wow. Could you try one more joke? For research purposes?- Bruce THAT IS NOT MY PURPOSE, BUT I SHALL ACQUIESCE. WHY DID ODIN KILL THE MERCHANT?- Thor Because he was a frost giant?- Bruce FRIEND BRUCE, I THINK YOU HAVE HEARD THESE JOKES BEFORE! HO, WHAT A JOKE YOU HAVE PLAYED ON ME!- Thor I’m going to meditate for a bit. Thanks, Thor. Hawaii might be safe tonight.- Bruce NOT IF ODIN FINDS A FROST GIANT IN ITS PRESENCE!- Thor I get it.- Bruce * Steve, you stand tall and proud for the American dream, right?- Tony Yeeees, why?- Steve Does that mean you’d support me if I slammed my face into a three-tiered cake?- Tony What?- Steve It wouldn’t have to be a wedding cake or anything. I could just buy three jam sponges or something and pile them on top of one another.- Tony I don’t understand. Take me back a few steps?- Steve Cake.- Tony It’s been a month, Steve.- Tony Twenty-nine cakeless days.- Tony Ah. Fury’s put you on some sort of diet, hasn’t he?- Steve A diet? Is that what you want to call it? It’s TORTURE, that’s what it is! Think I’d rather be water-boarded than deprived of my true love for any longer.- Tony And see, you can’t tell me off for that, because you’re away too! I could have meant you!- Tony Nice try, Stark, but I’ve long since resigned myself to playing second fiddle to your love affair with meringue.- Steve It’s true. You are essentially my mistress.- Tony You flatter me. Why has Fury insisted on a diet, anyway? You aren’t THAT out of shape, are you? I’ve only been gone six weeks!- Steve And every hour has felt like a year!- Tony Tony.- Steve Mmmmmmm?- Tony You’ve been comfort eating again, haven’t you?- Steve Maybe a little.- Tony Define ‘a little’.- Steve Well, really. I don’t consider eighteen profiteroles, two large pizzas, a cherry pie and a chocolate gateau to be excessive, do you? I mean, Thor eats that in an hour! It took me at least two.- Tony I’m going to ask them to cut this mission short. Captain Britain’s a bore to be around anyway; all monarchy and no freedom.- Steve Bring me back some scones, would you? There’s a doll.- Tony No.- Steve * TONY! IT IS MOST EXCELLENT TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN!- Thor You texted me, big guy, not the other way round. What can I do for you?- Tony IT IS ABOUT OUR FRIEND, BRUCE.- Thor What about him? You’re going to have to be more specific than that. With Bruce, it could be anything. Has he sat on a city again?- Tony NAY. HE IS MOST UNHAPPY. HE DID NOT EVEN RESPOND TO MY ATTEMPTS TO LIGHTEN HIS DARK MOODS. I FEAR HE HAS BEEN CURSED WITH DARK, DARK MAGIC!- Thor How did you try and cheer him up, exactly? I think we can get to the root of this problem quite quickly.- Tony I REGALED HIM WITH MUCH HUMOUR, OF COURSE! I TOLD HIM SOME OF ASGARD’S MOST LIGHT-HEARTED JOKES!- Thor Which ones? Remind me. I’ve only heard the one about Odin and the frost giant. Or was there two about that? Maybe six. I forget.- Tony IT WAS THE ONE ABOUT ODIN AND THE FROST GIANT, INDEED!- Thor Ha! That one was excellent, really. The best of a pretty hilarious bunch. I can’t believe he didn’t laugh. Did you ask what was wrong?- Tony TO NO AVAIL, FRIEND TONY.- Thor Hmm. I’ll drop by later with some Barium, see if that doesn’t lighten his spirits.- Tony THANK YOU. YOUR KIND HEARTEDNESS IS MUCH APPRECIATED.- Thor If I had a penny for every time I heard that, I wouldn’t be America’s richest man.- Tony * Tash- Clint Tash- Clint Tash- Clint Tash- Clint You know those seagulls in Finding Nemo? That’s you, Barton. That’s your future.- Natasha Aw, don’t be like that. I’ve sent you eighteen texts today and this is the only way to get you to reply.- Clint Hang on, are you saying I’m a seagull? I’m a hawk!- Clint More of a pigeon, if you ask me.- Natasha That hurts, Tash. That really hurts.- Clint You think you know pain? Keep texting me and see how your kneecaps feel.- Natasha Was that the doorbell? I think that was the doorbell. Good talk. Thanks Tash!- Clint *
