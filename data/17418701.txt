“Before you leave, I have a very special surprise for you guys.” Mr. Harrington announced, after the end of a particularly long, and draining decathlon practice. Peter let out a quiet groan. He was already half-asleep, and he had a mountain of homework to get back to. He’d most likely be staying up late into the night, and Tony hated it when he did that. 
Ever since May had died, and Tony had adopted him, Peter had been living in the Tower. His name was legally changed now, to Peter Parker-Stark,(even though he still went by Peter Parker at school), and he was being formally announced as the heir to Stark Industries at a press conference in a month. Life was good, even though he still felt the pain of losing May every day. Flash hadn’t been awful to him in months, even though he still kept up the taunts about Peter’s supposedly fake internship.
Peter should’ve known that his luck wouldn’t hold out.
Mr. Harrington pulled out a stack of papers, and passed them out to everyone. Peter took his without looking at it, and passed the stack onto Ned. 
Whispers broke out, after everyone had a paper, and had had a couple seconds to glance over it. Peter didn’t even bother reading it. His brain felt like mush, and besides, Mr. Harrington would go over everything anyways.
“I assume you all have already read it by now, but I’ll say it anyways. In a few days, as a reward for how well you all did at Nationals, we have been given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go on a field trip to Stark Tower!”
The rest of the team cheered, as Peter felt his soul transcend out of his body.
Well shit.

The next day at school was no better. Flash had taken up his verbal barrage of taunts again, except now they were targeted on the subject of Peter’s internship. The rest of the school was abuzz with jealousy, everyone else wanting to go to Stark Tower as well. Peter’s phone buzzed, and he swiped it open, after hiding it under the corner of his desk.

my friends call me mj: looking forward to the field trip, stark?


my friends call me mj: sorry, *parker 

my friends call me mj: harrington said he’s never seen so many decathlon team applicants
Peter frowned. MJ knew about Spider-Man of course, but had she really figured out his new parentage already? Pepper and Tony had been so careful with the news, not wanting Peter to be in the spotlight so soon after May’s death. 
He had to be careful with his response. He needed to say something that wouldn’t sound like he was Tony Stark’s son and trying to hide it.

peter-man: haha funny typo!!!1

Peter heard a cough, and felt the force of Mr. Davis’ glare on him. 
He quickly sent one more message and turned his phone off, stowing it in his bag.

Later that day, when Peter and Tony were working in the lab together on an old Iron Man suit, as were their tradition on Thursday nights. The silence between the two was comfortable, only broken by the occasional comment, or request to pass a tool. 
“So kid,” Peter looked up, setting down his tools. “what’s this I hear about a field trip tomorrow?” Tony held up the permission slip, a smirk on his face. 
fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck, Peter thought.
“How did you, um, get that form?” Peter asked, trying to sound casual.

“FRIDAY sees all, kiddo, and when she saw you burning a piece of paper that she had scanned, and determined you would need, she sent it to me, as per the Tony Knows Best Protocol,”
“I hate that protocol.” Peter muttered under his breath. 
“And then I wondered; ‘Why would my kid try to hide this from me? After all, it’s just a harmless field trip, right? Or was he worried about his old man embarrassing him?”
Peter flushed red and groaned. 
“Oh my god, Dad, you can’t embarrass me tomorrow.”
“What’s stopping me?” Tony retorted, eyes glowing with fondness.
Peter’s head shot up, and a shit-eating grin came on his face. 
“Pepper.”

The morning of the field trip, Peter was still smirking from their conversation last night, and Tony was still quietly fuming. Pepper was oblivious to what all the tension in the room was about, making it even funnier to watch Tony squirm every time she interacted with Peter.
Looking at her watch, she gulped down the rest of her coffee(which Peter strongly suspected was spiked with vodka), and stood up, pressing a kiss to both of
