Chapter 1: Illustration for With One More Try (Can We Start Again) by Infinite_Monkeys
    


Summary:

May I just say how much I LOVE the Fun With Time Loops series by Infinite_Monkeys! It's funny, it's sad, it has action and amazing dialogue, haertbreak and moments that just crack me up. I'm re-reading the whole tale right now and I had already started sketching before that. As such, have one of my favourite scene - the chocolate fountain.

“Somebody please tell me what I'm looking at,” Stark said. “Because no way is the evil villain we were sent here to stop cuddling up to a chocolate fountain.”
