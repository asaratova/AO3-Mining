Chapter 1: Who’s Peter Parker?
    




Chapter Text
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI
So Ms Potts thinks this is a good idea for Mr Stark. So, this will be the official twitter for all things Stark Intern related :-) -PP
Flash @BetterThanYou
Really Parker, No one is going to believe this
Ned @NedLeeds
Okay @BetterThanYou. We don’t need this kind of negativity
BLACK LIVES MATTER @MichelleJones
@BetterThanYou Fuck off will you. Peters internship is real, and you are the one focusing on it makes me think. Are you jealous of him?
Flash @BetterThanYou
Like I’d be jealous of a girl thinking she’s a guy. She’s lying for attention
BLACK LIVES MATTER @MichelleJones
Lying sure. So, the stats lie when it says 75% of trans youth feel unsafe at school? Or 41.8% have contemplated suicide? 
Ned @NedLeeds
Also 83% have experienced bullying, 35% of that being physical attacks. Why would someone do that for attention?
Flash @BetterThanYou
Because you can’t change who you were born as. Basic Biology.
Peter Parker @PeterParkour
No I cannot change my biology, but I have undergone treatment to make myself feel better. And legally changed my gender marker and name. So, you saying this is technically a hate crime which you can be fined for.
Flash @BetterThanYou
Nope. You are a she
Peter Parker @PeterParkour
Okay, I’m not arguing this.

Mr Stark tried to get Dum-E too make a sandwich, but it has been dipped in motor oil. Now he has to try and say he can’t eat it to the 4 AI’s who want him to eat it. -PP
Taylor @PepperPottsStan
How do you know Tony Stark? Are you actually an Intern?  Can we get a picture?
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI
I’m his intern, I’m Peter and I am at Midtown High School. No, you cannot have a picture because the lab has confidential items in it.
Taylor @PepperPottsStan
Fair. Do you know Pepper Potts?
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI
Yes.
Taylor @PepperPottsStan
THAT’S SO COOL!
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI
It is. She’s nice. Plus, really funny. Mr Stark is scared of her.
Taylor @PepperPottsStan
I want to meet her when I can! I can’t believe you know her!
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI

Pepper Potts @PPotts
Ohh hello, @PepperPottsStan. I shall also like to meet you, I shall send you a date and time for a meeting if you want?
Taylor @PepperPottsStan

Pepper Potts @PPotts
Okay, @PepperPottsStan I shall see you soon!
#1 Intern SI @Intern4SI

Pepper Potts @PPotts
They seem like a nice person
Avengers News and More @AvengersAndMore
A person named Peter Parker started a twitter claiming to be Tony Starks intern and then makes a fans dream come true as he involves Pepper Potts in the conversation who says the fan can have an interview with her.
