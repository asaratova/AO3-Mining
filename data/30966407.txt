Chapter 1: Peter gets a rude awakening
    




Chapter Text
“Get up idiot” a voice echoes throughout the room not soon thereafter.A stream of ice-cold water splashes down on Peter, making him jump onto the ceiling. He runs across the ceiling on all fours, hissing at the spy standing by the bed.“Get down from Stark’s ceiling kid, he’s gonna murder you if he sees you up there again” Bucky calls out, placing the water gun on the ground.Peter doesn’t say anything, he just hisses again before walking out of the room, still on the ceiling.“Underoos get down from there, sorry I made Buck wake you up. But in my defense you’re gonna be late for school” Tony says, barely reacting to the thing that’s now almost a daily routine.“It’s fine, but why is it always uncle Buck who wakes me up, he’s the one I love the most after Harles and aunt Nat” Peter says, sitting down at the kitchen Island.“Because I volunteered, a few others did as well but none of them have the balls to wake you up in the morning” Bucky says, taking some coffee from the pot.“You’re lucky I don’t hate you enough to be mad uncle Buck, you’re really lucky”“Oh you love me, you’re too good of a person to hate a poor man like myself” Bucky says, placing a plate with a mountain of food so big it would’ve taken at least 3 normal people to eat it all. But since Peter has the unfortunate fortune to have super-fast metabolism, he can eat all of it in under 15 minutes.Peter doesn’t say anything to Bucky, instead he starts on the food in front of him.As people start walking into the kitchen, all of them at various stages of alertness. Natasha as usual has probably been awake for 2 hours, having spent her morning in the gym. Clint looks like he woke up about 2 minutes ago, with pillow marks still on his face.“Good morning сын паука, did you sleep well?” Natasha says, sitting down beside him with a cup of coffee in hand.“Alright, until Мистер мудак over there decided to wake me up” Natasha doesn’t say anything, she just looks in disbelief at him for a few moments before bursting into laughter. Bucky just looks at him with fake hurt, before he also starts laughing.“Wait, what did he say?” Tony asks, his brain finally catching up with what’s happening.“Oh nothing Stark, just didn’t know your kid had such a big vocabulary” Bucky finally says as the laughter starts to die down from the people in the kitchen who know Russian.“He just called Bucky “Asshole” Stark, you should be proud” Nat says, finally sitting up, her eyes still filled with laughter.“LaNgUaGe” Tony says, smirking at Steve who’s giving him the finger.“I still don’t understand why that’s a thing, Steve swears worse than all of us fuckers together” Bucky says, and gets a stink eye from Steve.“Well, Mr. Old guy over there slipped up during the Sokovia mission. And it’s probably the best thing we can bully him for”“Understandable, have a great day” Bucky says, making Peter proud that he managed to teach Bucky a little gen Z.Everyone else however just looks at him in confusion, well except Wanda who is also well versed in the young spiders’ humor.“You have a great day at school kid, I’ll see you later” Tony says as the car pulls up outside the school. Why Tony insisted on driving Peter to school was a mystery to the young man, but nobody else seemed to question it at breakfast. But the big smile that was on his face made Peter slightly anxious about what was going to happen during the day. But since his Spidey-sense wasn’t going off it couldn’t be anything that important.“See you later Mr. Stark, are you picking me up?” Peter says, starting to open the door.“I think so... unless something important comes up. But I’ll text you if it does” Tony says, motioning to his wrist where the StarkWatch is, Peter is wearing an identical one. It’s an unreleased model, but Tony had granted a few people to wear it before release as long as they didn’t go around and show it off. And Tony was confident that Peter wouldn’t.As Peter walked through the corridors at Midtown school of science and technologies he was ever so thankful that Pepper had reminded him to bring the noise cancellers. Peter had made them a few months ago as the sound in school had made him go into a sensory overload and made him stay home for a few days. They were small and you wouldn’t notice them unless you knew what you were looking for. The sound in the hallways was at an astronomical amount, and thanks to the noise cancellers he could hear just below what the ordinary person could. If he didn’t he would’ve heard about 10x the amount a normal person would. “Morning idiot, you look like shit” MJ said as he approached the lockers.“Wow thanks, MJ, I can feel the love”“What, you didn’t have the best morning today or?...”“Did Nat send you the footage?” I say with a groan as I slam my head into the locker.“Nope, Shuri did” MJ says, popping the P. Of course her girlfriend had managed to get her hands on that footage.“And did she specify how she got the footage?”
