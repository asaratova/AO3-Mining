Tony Stark  @iamironman
@StarkSon When I said you're my mini-me, I never wanted to see you to do something so monumentally impulsive on live television as I did, such as outing your secret identity you were previously so hell-bent on keeping.
 
Peter Stark  @StarkSon
@iamironman too bad, so sad. ur genes created me. 
 
Tony Stark  @iamironman
@StarkSon I'm blaming your mother's half for your impulsiveness.
 
Peter Stark  @StarkSon
@iamironman u roll a 2. ur deflection of responsibility falls short of its target
  
Tony Stark  @iamironman
@StarkSon Damn. Can I roll again?
  
Peter Stark @StarkSon
@iamironman no! thats not how this works. accept the fact you gave me my poor decision making skills
  
Tony Stark @iamironman
@StarkSon No.
  
Pepper Potts @VirginiaPotts
@StarkSon @iamironman It is entirely your half of the genes, Tony.
  
Tony Stark @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts Yet again, the disrespect from my own household. This is unbelievable. 
  
Col. James Rhodes @WarMachine
@StarkSon @iamironman @VirginiaPotts Pepper is right, Tones.
  
Tony Stark @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine Not you, too, Platypus. All of you are turning against me. 
  
Col. James Rhodes @WarMachine
@StarkSon @iamironman @VirginiaPotts We're not turning against you, Tony. We're just saying you and Peter tend not to make the best decisions. Especially when it comes to vacations.
  
Tony Stark  @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine Are you implying going to Sicily is not a good idea? Do you not wish to come on our family outing?
  
Col. James Rhodes  @WarMachine
@StarkSon @iamironman @VirginiaPotts That's not what I'm saying, I'm just saying it's a bit impulsive. You just ungrounded Peter, and I'm still handling the all the Accords negotiations for the Avengers. I have a lot of work to do.
  
Tony Stark @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine No, no, this is great. Just say what you really mean. You don't want to hang out with me anymore?
  
Col. James Rhodes @WarMachine
@StarkSon @iamironman @VirginiaPotts I think hanging out with you is bad for our friendship.
  
Peter Stark  @StarkSon
@iamironman @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine pepper theyre doing it again....
  
Pepper Potts @VirginiaPotts
@StarkSon @iamironman @WarMachine Funny, considering I believe they had an Accords meeting that started ten minutes ago.
  
Tony Stark @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine Honey bear, don't blow this for us. It took me three weeks to convince her to take this trip.
  
Col. James Rhodes  @WarMachine
@StarkSon @iamironman @VirginiaPotts Me not blowing this for us? You're the one who keeps pushing the issue.
  
Tony Stark  @iamironman
@StarkSon @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine You're not wanting to go on our family vacation! You're saying interacting with me is bad for our friendship! How can I not push the issue? This is way more important than the Accords.
  
Peter Stark  @StarkSon
@iamironman @VirginiaPotts @WarMachine im having friday delete this thread from existence to end the madness
  
Peter Stark  @StarkSon
