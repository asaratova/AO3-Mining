They called it V-E — victory in Europe — but all Bucky knew was that they were alive.“You hear that, Steve?” Bucky said, even though Steve was right next to him grinning like the sun. “We’re going home.”Steve stopped clapping just long enough to throw his arms around Bucky — and was he ever going to get used to that, Steve’s body tall and solid instead of being all skin and bones — and said, “Yeah, Buck, we did it,” in a low, wet voice, and it was all worth it, sleeping half-frozen and drinking more dirt than coffee, even the days of being strapped down on a lab bench muttering name-rank-serial number.———Their train pulled into the station as the sun was setting orange over the river. Bucky had his case in one hand and Steve on his other side as they stepped off the platform, and he honestly thought that’d be the end of the war.———They got an apartment with two bedrooms, and it was okay because it was Uncle Sam footing the bill. They had proper mattresses and pillows that weren’t rocks, and the first day back Bucky scarfed down a slice of bread with a scrape of real butter, and that was possibly the best thing he’d tasted all his life.———In Europe, Steve had still kept his notebook in his jacket pocket, a pencil worn down to a nub, and in the evenings when they’d finished rations and banked the fire low, he’d take it out and draw: Dum Dum with his mustache even wilder than usual, Gabe with a wide grin as he listened to Dernier tell some outrageous story. His mouth was soft when he drew, and Bucky would kick back in his sleeping bag with only half an ear on the murmur of conversation around him and look at the way the light shone on Steve’s face.When they came back, Bucky was the one who bought notebooks and pencils. When he pressed them into Steve’s hands, Steve looked at him with a mouth that seemed more sad than happy and said, “Thank you, Buck,” very quietly.———In Europe, when it got colder they’d started pairing up in their sleeping bags, pressed tight to each other to catch their body heat while the cold seeped into their bones from beneath — and when it got too cold for even that, somehow Bucky’d ended up curled around Steve in a doubled-up bag without ever talking about it.And sometimes during the night when it was pitch dark, and Steve was breathing quietly into the crook of Bucky’s neck, Bucky would tug Steve closer and Steve would slip a careful hand into Bucky’s pants, wrap his hand around Bucky’s cock easy and slow. It took Bucky all his willpower not to make a sound, instead biting the inside of his cheek bloody, but Steve always pressed his quiet sounds into Bucky’s throat while Bucky stroked him, and it made something in Bucky’s chest burn hot and fierce to know that it was him drawing those noises out of Steve. The first night back Bucky woke up three times during the night reaching for his rifle, and then gave up and rolled onto the floor because the mattress was too soft too warm and it dropped him into dreams of falling, falling, falling. In the morning Steve made breakfast with dark dark eyes and didn’t look at him as he passed over the eggs.———The thing was.The thing was, Bucky had thought they’d come back, find a dame for him and one for Steve, and they’d go on as if the war had never happened.———Bucky started sleeping with his rifle under his hand, curling around the barrel like he would a bed-mate. It wasn’t the answer — he still woke up with his heart in his mouth, hand wrapped so hard around the rifle it left marks on his palm — but it meant that he didn’t have to scream, could sit with his back to the wall, the rifle propped on his knee, and wait it out until he stopped shaking.(Never his hands, though — Bucky had learned that early on, how to keep the target in the cross-hairs even when the rest of him was trembling like he was about to fall apart.)He didn’t dream, not properly. It just came to him in fragments — darkness, and pain, and terror so deep it hurt his teeth. He spit out his name-rank-serial number and that didn’t stop it, it didn’t ever stop—In those flashes, sometimes Steve came for him, like he’d done once before, and he unstrapped him with hands big and steady and surprisingly careful. “It’s Steve,” he said, “Bucky, it’s me,” and Bucky looked up and smiled and thought Steve had never been so beautiful.Other times, he waited for Steve, he waited for him and Steve never came. He waited and hurt and hated Steve, a little, before he woke up retching and scrambling for his rifle.When the morning came on those days, he couldn’t make himself look at Steve, even when Steve asked, “what’s going on, Buck?” in that quiet voice of his. Steve would touch his shoulder and Bucky would shake him off, because he knew Steve had come for him, had risked everything to break into Zola’s lab and bring him out, and he wasn’t sure he’d deserved that.———In Europe, Bucky had watched Steve’s face, memorized his gait and the way his weight settled along his body, because Steve was t
