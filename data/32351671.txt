Chapter 1





Chapter Text

Immediately after chapter 32 of Rise of the Arcanist
“What do want us to do?” Scott says swallowing down the bile that threatens to overwhelm him if he pauses.  He has talked to his mom about this before.  About how she manages to not get overwhelmed seeing people hurt and suffering and the memory of that conversation flashes back before his eyes.“You have to compartmentalize Scott.  You feel all of it of course, but you can’t let it control you.  You acknowledge the pain, the fear, and everything and just put it to the side to handle later.  If you don’t control it, it controls you and I can’t help anyone if I am too afraid or overwhelmed.  Once the crisis is over, it usually hits pretty hard. But it is knowing that by staying focused that I have saved lives, or at least gave them their best chance, that helps a lot when you are in the middle of things.”  He really appreciates his mom now more than ever.“Get everyone who can help to the temporary police station.  I don’t know who’s left there, but they will need help.  I am sure that there are kids whose parents are gone and we need to find them to make sure they are okay” Stiles tells him.Scott inhales suddenly imagining what seeing his mom dust when he was five or six would have been like and what that would have done to him.  He nods and looks over the clearing at the crowd of people looking lost.  He spots Alpha Ito and Alpha Delgado and moves towards them.  “Alphas!” he roars catching everyone’s attention.“Alpha McCall?” Satomi says looking confused but also surprised.  Leon looks furious but also lost.  Like he wants to kill something, but he doesn’t have a target.As he arrives Scott spots several others alphas approaching and he lets out a roar “Alphas!  TO ME!” he yells and in seconds there are fifteen alphas suddenly there with more betas following in their wake looking at the alphas in shock.“LISTEN!” he yells to quieten the crowd.  Everyone looks to him but it is then that he spots Aiden and by the wrecked expression he knows that they must have lost Ethan as well, but he doesn’t have time to deal with that right now.  “Stiles and the others have told us that this is not limited to here, it has happened everywhere.  That means that we need to act and act now!”“But who do we fight?” Alpha Anderson growls angrily.  His pack is decimated like the others and he is barely holding it together with the pain of so many lost pack bonds.“This isn’t about fighting” Scott answers and that sets off snarls and furious yelling.“ENOUGH!” Scott roars, his eyes flashing crimson immediately answered by fifteen pairs of red flashing in the crowd.“Our Alpha is gone” one of the Marshall packs betas yells out desperately.  “Why did no one inherit his alpha powers?”Scott looks stunned as the rest and the alphas all look around but they realize that many packs were here in their entirety and those packs that lost their alpha don’t seem to have gotten a new one.  “I don’t know but we will try and find out why later, that isn’t our top priority.”“Why not?!” Marcus Reynolds asks looking at the young alpha.  “We have over a dozen packs without an alpha!”“Because it is not just us.  How many homes suddenly lost both parents?  How many kids are suddenly alone?  How many babies?” he challenges and from the looks of surprise he can see that no one thought about that.“Listen.  Stiles and the emissaries are going to try and get us answers but we need to work search and rescue with the local police.  To search every home and find those who are in danger.  Dave and Whulibela are leading the search for the magical folk, but we need to help the other people.  And with our senses, we can do it faster than anyone.”“What about our homes?” Alpha Roberts asks suddenly looking much more concerned.Scott pauses and hates that he does but he recognizes the need.  “Do you have connections with the local authorities in your territory?” he asks.Amanda Roberts nods.  “My husband is” she pauses and from the look of devastation Scott knows that the man must have been lost “was…he was friends with city leaders.  I think they will be struggling.”Scott nods and makes an executive decision.  “Okay, if you have contacts in authority at your home territories, I will ask Master Lyra to send you home.  Everyone else we are going to town to start helping.”“And why should we listen to you?” an Alpha Scott doesn’t remember challenges him.  He thinks the man is from up near Seattle.  “You aren’t Hale.  He was the High Alpha, not you.”Scott looks surprised but sees several others looking concerned and thoughtful at the challenge.  He straightens up.  “I am Scott McCall, a True Alpha.  And…” he adds when he sees the man start to reply “I am delivering the orders to you from the High Alpha.  High Alpha Stilinski.”That catches more than a few of the alphas off guard.  They had agreed to submit to the High Alphas but that was tempered by Hale actually being a werewolf and his family lega
