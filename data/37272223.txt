Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Steve Rogers never backs down from a fight.Steve used to be a small guy. He had been short and skinny, no muscles and lungs that struggled to take in air. Despite this, when he witnessed injustice, he fought back. When he saw someone being bullied, he fought back. When he saw discrimination, he fought back. However, due to his small structure, fighting back almost always resulted in bruises, or black eyes, or swollen lips, or, even sometimes, broken bones. His poor mother worried. She tried to hide it from Steve, but he’d occasionally catch the tears that ran down her cheeks as she cleaned him up. Of course, he felt guilty. She was a single mother and she already had enough on her plate trying to keep him healthy; the last thing she needed was the added ache of patching him up and worrying about his fighting. And yet, he just couldn’t help himself.  A year ago, though, shortly after his 16th birthday, he’d hit a growth spurt. In the past year, he’d grown almost another foot. With stronger lungs, he could actually power through a workout, and he developed muscles. Still, he was eager to stand up for the little guy. And now, with his new body, he could actually do some damage.How much damage, he hadn’t realized.It was an unseasonably cool August night in Brooklyn when Steve’s life changed forever.Steve had been out with Sam, his best, well, only friend, grabbing burgers and milkshakes while they caught up once Sam arrived back home from football camp, where he had spent the last three weeks. After dinner, Sam had to get back home. Of course, he’d invited Steve to join, but Steve knew that Sam’s parents were eager to catch up with their son, who they had missed terribly while he was away. So, Steve walked back home alone, going the long way, taking advantage of the nice weather.As Steve passed an alley, he heard a voice crying out, and then the sound of a fist, hitting soft flesh, followed by more crying and groans. Without thinking twice about it, Steve ran towards the noise. Once he reached the source, he was confronted by a larger guy, beating up a smaller, younger teenage boy. It was an uneven pairing, and it pissed Steve off to see someone clearly taking advantage of their size.Steve grabbed the larger guy by the back of the shirt, throwing him down to the ground, stepping on his chest to keep him down. He helped up the smaller guy up, encouraging him to run while the other guy was still down.Before he had a chance to get up, Steve was on top of the bully, pounding his face. Steve was blinded by anger as he continued to smash the guy’s face in, failing to notice his knuckles bruising, being covered with blood. Steve never even heard the sirens and hadn’t noticed that he was being arrested until he was secure in the backseat of the police car, on his way to the precinct-----After a long, cold, lonely night in a cell, Steve is brought into a tiny room, with a small metal table, two chairs placed on either end. Steve is forced into a chair, still handcuffed, and then left alone. A couple of minutes later, the door opens back up, and in walks a tall man, with shaggy brown hair, wearing a slightly too large black suit.“Hi, I’m George Barnes,” the man says, reaching out to shake Steve’s hand. Steve hesitantly holds up his hands, revealing the handcuffs, and the older man retracts his hand, dropping it back by his side. “I’m the public defender assigned to your case.”Steve nods, unsure of what to say.George Barnes places his briefcase on the table as he takes a seat, pulling out a file. He opens it up and studies it before speaking to Steve again. “This is a first-time offense and you’re a minor, so you’re getting off easy. And it was self-defense. With a small bail and a commitment to some community service, you should be allowed to be released into the custody of a guardian.”Steve looks down, fighting back the tears that are threatening to escape. He gulps before speaking. “That’s not gonna happen.”“Huh?” George asks.Steve gulps again. He keeps his head down but lifts his eyes to look at the public defender. “Mom died a few months ago and Dad is long gone. Good luck finding him.”George looks up at Steve, clearly unsure how to respond. He stands up, grabbing his things. “Give me a minute.”Almost an hour later, George comes back, this time with an officer following behind him. The officer walks over to Steve, unlocking his handcuffs. Steve looks between the two men, perplexed as to what’s going on.“You’re being released into my custody,” George explains.Steve is given back his things and led outside with George.“Where’ve you been staying?” George asks as he opens the passenger door of his car to Steve, ushering him in. Steve just shrugs. George doesn’t let it go. “Steve…”“I’ve still been living at my mom and mine’s place,” Steve replies sheepishly.“How?” George asks.Steve shrugs. “After the funeral, no one said anything. No one came to get me. So, I just kept living there.”“How have yo
