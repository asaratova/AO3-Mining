Chapter Text
Despite all of the jokes that their initial meeting had caused, Tony and Harley had really bonded during the Mandarian Incident. So much so that Tony made a point of visiting Harley and his family before Christmas the next year, despite all the mocking he got from the other Avengers and any resurgent rumours of illegitimate children. Harley's mother - Crystal - was flustered with the presence of the genius billionaire philanthropist in her living room for all of one minute. The sight of Tony Stark geeking out over a bunch of circuits with her eleven year old son in her tatty living room did much to humanise him. When she told Honey Stark this, the girl had laughed and told her what had happened during her first few weeks living with the man. "He sat me down in front of an open car hood and started explaining what parts did what and taught me how to fix them. To this day I can still do that...and hijack one when necessary." While that did not necessarily calm Crystal's rampant thought process, the two Starks were welcome in the Keener homestead whenever they liked. And the same happened in Stark Tower. The three Keeners showed up outside the Tower and while Pepper took Crystal and Peyton shopping in New York, Harley convinced his mentor to start creating again, managing to convince him that there wouldn't be another Ultron. And after the stupid Civil War, the Keeners had been one of the first visitors to Tony's sickbed - even before Honey (who was stuck in Asgard). Crystal had let out stream of curse words that awed and shocked all who heard them, Peyton had burst into tears when she saw War Machine (her favourite superhero) bound to a wheelchair and Harley had conspired with Vision and FRIDAY in an attempt to find the Rogue Avengers. Eventually, Tony was let out of hospital and the Keeners had to return home. Tony had promised to visit before Christmas...but that never happened. All because of some stupid lone gunman trying to prove a point. Harley could admit, later, that he did not react well. Bolting his door and shooting anyone who came near with his potato gun was not very sensible, especially when he had a seven year old sister to consider. But he was allowed to overreact, in his mind. His mother was dead. It all ended when Pepper Potts strode up to the house and, using the key Crystal had given Tony, came into the house and pulled Harley into her arms and let him break down before bundling both Keener children onto a jet and back to New York, where they were installed in the Compound with the remaining Avengers and Laura Barton and her brood. Lila and Peyton quickly became great friends while Harley and Cooper took a while to warm up to each other. And when Honey returned from Asgard complete with a newborn baby boy and a brooding silver haired Sokovian, the Compound was soon brimming with life and activity - partially filling the hole in Harley's heart. Meanwhile, Pepper and Tony fought for Harley and Peyton to be able to stay there as family. They sighted the fact that Tony had successfully raised Honey to adulthood (the woman in question agreed fiercely) and he had the funds to support them both with plenty to spare and he had good relationships with them and there were plenty of security protocols in the Compound that would ensure their safety even if aliens came pouring out of the sky again. When Tony had, shyly, shown Harley and Peyton the certificates that said he was now their legal guardian (and father) they had both tackled him with hugs and many tears were shed. "It doesn't mean you're going to inherit Stark Industries or anything, but I'm sure the Lady Stark wouldn't mind you being her Head of R&D and PR respectively." Tony teased, laughing as Honey threw a pillow at them and Peyton squealed in protest. Harley felt a warm sensation in his chest. It was his heart healing. 




Notes:

I figured that I needed to write this before I delved too far into the Infinity War era of this series, just so everyone is in the right places and everyone knows how they got there.I didn't want to kill Harley's mum...but I couldn't see another way...makes me feel a bit like a super villain that...Peyton is a cutie, but her and Lila together are going to cause mayhem.Vision is up next!Please leave a comment!
