 @StarkSon I literally do not want to hear anything out of you, kid. You want to keep this ridiculous account? These are the terms we’re doing it under.
 
Pepper Potts   @ViriniaPotts 
 @iamironman @StarkSon Honestly, Tony, you can’t have expected him to stay off social media forever.
 
Tony Stark   @iamironman 
 @StarkSon @VirginiaPotts I cannot believe you’re turning against me too. And on Twitter. The disrespect from my own household.
