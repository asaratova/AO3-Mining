Chapter 1: Fly Boy
    




Chapter Text
You live on Naboo as a healer, treating animals and people alike. You are never paid, but instead trade one service for the other. Some days you have nothing to do and other days you have hands to few.Never, though, you expected this to happen.The rain pours down, droplets as large as Tima eggs. But you are safe in your little home. That is, until there is a knock on your door. It’s late, you expect no one. It is likely someone lost in the terrible weather.
You open the door to a tall man, with long black hair and a sallow skin. You gape up at him. “My ship crashed, I need a place to wait out the rain.” There is something commandeering in his deep voice. It is not very polite, but you disregard it. You couldn’t leave the poor guy out in this weather. You step aside to let him in. He doesn’t thank you with more than a slight nod.You barely dare tell the man to make himself at home. He flops down on the chair by your small working table. He heaves a deep sigh. You kick yourself mentally in the butt and decide to man up and be hospitable. This man might scare you a little, but that is no reason for you not to show him kindred. You retrieve a towel and hand it to him. “T-Thanks..” There is a note of hesitation in the man’s voice. You have no idea how to reply, so you back off to the sitting area.He sits there, at you table, observing your small house. His eyes stray over to you. “I’m going to need a place to sleep.” He does his best to sound strict. “How about you tell me your name first. I’ll give you a pillow in return.” You answer.He has to think on it for a few moments. “I’m Ben Solo.” He then begrudgingly answers.  “If you tell me what happened, you can also earn a blanket.” You try to be playful, hoping he will open up a little bit. “My ship crashed.” Is the curt answer. “And yet here you are.” You reply. “And yet here I am. My ship is too small to offer me shelter and I can’t repair it in weather like this.” There is something severe in Ben’s dark eyes that you see even from where you are sitting.It’s late, you’re starting to feel sort of tired. “Alright, I am turning off the light.” You stand up and go over to your bed. You dig a spare pillow and a comforter from under it. “Where am I supposed to sleep?” It is only half a question. “On the couch.” You reply. “That will never fit.” Ben argues, rather loudly. “Well …” You honestly have no idea what to say. Ben is most certainly too tall for your couch.
“Well?” Ben asks furrowing his brow. “We can share the bed.” You mumble. “Share???” Ben’s voice is hard and your take a step back. “Y-yeah…” You nod. “Is that the type of service you provide?” The severity is back in Ben’s eyes. “I am a healer, not a harlot.” You reply, not about to let him insult you. “Sure you are.” Ben rises from his chair. He is over at you in two big strides.Ben peers down on you. There is something electrifying about him, between you. He’s demanding, but also desirable.You back off to the bed. Ben follows you, his eyes focussed on yours. You sit down on the edge of the mattress, not breaking eye contact. Ben crouches in front of you. He pulls off one of his black gloves and reaches out to touch your face. Chills run down your spine, it feels as if there is electricity under his skin. You shut your eyes, knowing what is going to happen next.
Ben’s lips are cold and clumsy upon yours. You accept them, feeling the same electricity as with his fingers. Ben arches forward, to press his lips tighter against yours. You lift a hand to cup his jaw. This is escalating quickly and you can even muster the brain power to give any sort of objection. Not a single cell in your entire being thinks of objecting, even if Ben is all but a complete stranger to you.Ben presses you into the sheets, hovering over you. He seems indecisive on how to carry on. You draw his face to yours again, kissing him slowly, tenderly. Ben’s hands tighten on your upper arms, the electricity thrumming over your skin. He is swift to deepen the kiss. His tongue invades your mouth. You whimper, encouraging him. His tongue searches your mouth. His fingers leave bruises on your arms, but you barely notice it.
Ben’s pelvis sinks down against yours, he’s letting his body down. He is, however, much taller than you, so his back needs to arch a little bit to accommodate the contact between your pelvisses and your mouths. He is trying his best though. You in your turn do your best to make him as comfortable as possible.In order to avoid Ben getting some sort of hernia, you nudging him gently, until his is on his back on the mattress. To your surprise, Ben is rather compliant. His hands find your hips once you straddle him. The severity isn’t in his eyes anymore. He actually seems rather insecure.You start to slowly rock your hips. You pelvis grinds against Ben’s. He groans softly and looks up at you, willing you to carry on. Willing you to give him more. You lean in and kiss him deeply. Ben respo
