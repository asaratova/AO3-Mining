Chapter 1: Her
    




Chapter Text
He straightened his tie and smoothed back his thinning hair with one shaking hand and practiced his monologue one more time.

“My name is Doctor Craig LaRange and I demand to see Captain Rogers right this instant!” 

He’d practiced in the mirror, and then in front of his wife, who told him to be more stern. They would never let him in if they thought he was just a fan, trying to get their paws on Captain Rogers. He stared up at Stark Tower, a gleaming, phallic symbol in the sky, a bright ‘A’ burned bright even in the midday sky. A shove to the shoulder got him moving and he stumbled his way into the reception area. There was an ostentatious water fountain in the middle of the area that was two lions with their backs turned toward each other, arched up in a frozen gold growl. There were potted plants, leather chairs, women and men circling the large reception desk in what looked like matching pant suits and was that a statue of Iron Man? He shuttered and meandered up to the desk. He suddenly felt underdressed in his brown slacks and checkered shirt, a plain black tie that his wife had pressed for him. He put his hands in his pockets and fiddled absently with the watch that was in there. After ten minutes of shuffling forward awkwardly he was at the front desk. The red-headed receptionist looked at him with a tight smile on his lips.
“How can I help you sir?” He smelled coffee on the man’s breath, he could see a hint of makeup around his eyes and what looked like an rash breaking out by his collar, probably a reaction to cologne or laundry detergent. “I need to speak with Captain Rogers.” What he wasn’t expecting was for the man to laugh. But he did, loudly. Garnering the attention of his coworkers and a few guards standing near a potted palm filling out paperwork. “Get in line.” Craig felt his face flush in embarrassment. “Now listen here, I’m serious. This is a matter of life and death and I need to speak with Captain Rogers this instant.” “Whose life?” The red headed man challenged. “Mine.” Craig snapped. “Listen, this isn’t a security service. This is one of the most important offices in the world. I don’t have time to do this today,” He made a gesture with his hand waving over a guard. “Emanual, please take this man outside? Another Rogers fan.” He said. The security guard offered Craig a look of pity, and then held out his hand, giving a two short pumps that obviously meant, ‘right this way crazy asshole’, but Craig wouldn’t have it. 'She deserves better than this, and I’m running out of time.'“I refuse! I demand to see Captain Rogers or I’m not leaving! You have no idea what your allowing to happen.” Emanual puffed out his chest. “Sir I’m going to need you to come with me.” His voice was stern, but the pity was still there. “I don’t need this! I need to see Captain Rogers!” He was causing a scene now, his face flushed in embarrassment and anger.
“Sir-!”
“Why do you need to see the Captain?” They turned to find Tony Stark in pressed black slacks, an ACDC shirt with a black suit jacket over it. Beside him was Pepper Potts, looking tan and fresh in a white pant suit and black brief case. “I need his help.” He said. Tony Stark was honestly the last Avenger he wanted to ask for help from. He was the most self serving one, and may not have the same reaction to her as the others might. “I’m going to need you to elaborate.” He said. Taking a step forward. Craig made a split decision. Looking around in all the cameras that Shield could be watching him through, he decided he didn’t care. She deserves better. “Shield. Shield is after me, after us. They’re holding her captive! They wont let her go.” He rushed out. He didn’t know how fast Shield could be there to take him. They could already be in this building. “Shield?” Tony Stark took a step forward. Eyeing the cameras. He quickly pecked Pepper on the cheek, and then took hold of Craig’s shoulder. “Come on.” He led them toward an elevator. But Craig heard the screetch of tires outside, alerting him that they had come. He began to sweat. He was pushed into an elevator. “Jarvis, private floors. Lab 4. Lock down from 15 up. Lockdown. Nobody in. Nobody out.” He said. The elevator was moving at blinding speed and Craig felt nausea rise in his stomach. But he wouldn’t back down.
She deserved better.

“I need you to tell me everything, no skipping parts.” Stark ordered. He glared down at the man who stared down at the interrogation table. Craig was sweating into his tie. His stomach in knots, regretting the oatmeal he’d forced down an hour before. He was in an interrogation room. Everything was cold metal and glass where he was sure he was being watched from the other side. “Captain Rogers.” He demanded again. He wanted to tell this to Captain Rogers.  “He’s on his way. And you better not be wasting his time. Or mine, for that matter.” Stark said. And leaned back in his much comfier seat.
The door slid open a moment after that
