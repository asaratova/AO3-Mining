Chapter 1: Rebirth
    




Chapter Text
Theirs had always been a life of sacrifice. They had known that going in, and they had known that as they rode into the night, their hearts soaring for the triumph their care would not let them shout into the stars. They knew as they left that they would be dogged for the rest of their days, but they would be dogs no longer; free as wolves, free in their pack, tied up in one another for eternity.And so that came to pass.The eternity of death was what was waiting at the end of the long road of freedom, awaiting their arrival with open arms. S.H.I.E.L.D. never let its captives go. They were agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. until they died—and if they decided to contest this fact, death came swifter than anticipated.Fury gave the order, but, to Maria's surprise, ordered two spared."Sir," she trailed off, hesitant, "is there any reason to spare Coulson or Potts? They're the most vulnerable...""For remembrance," Fury said, his eyes glittering darker than the midnight sky under which the Avengers now rode, free, "as a reminder."Maria didn't understand, but Fury had that look in his eyes again that said she shouldn't question, and so she didn't."Bring the bodies back," he said as she went to leave, "they'll be preserved here, should the agents need another reminder.""...If you're sure, sir," she murmured, her heart heavy as she shut the grand oak door to Fury's office behind her, as if she could shut out the weight of her orders....They had a month of freedom; a long, beautiful month in Eden, in which they enjoyed the life they had always wanted to live, safe and sound and happy. For a time they could forget about the pale horse awaiting them at the end of the road.Then S.H.I.E.L.D. decided it was about time they remembered what they had run from—and what, inevitably, they would run towards.It was Tony that died first; brave, reckless Tony, so in love with his suit, with his cars, with driving free. The car crash left no body, nothing to mourn, but they all knew. The newspapers called it a drunk driving accident, (Pepper would've torn out Jameson's throat personally, but they never went into the city anymore, never went out alone), but they all knew better.Steve was the next to die, though to him, that probably came as something of a relief. While he fought valiantly against the agents sent to kill him for his team's sake, he was a dead man walking and they all knew it. His Tony, his wonderful, beautiful Tony had left him first, and the Captain had lost enough. His losses went with him, guiding him into the  night. Clint and Natasha were next. There was no weapon, no blood, no nothingit was as if they had melted away into the night, to be scattered to the winds like so many ashes.Phil rent his clothes grieving, tearing his suit jacket and his shirt in a fit of madness, the buttons scattering like their bones as he screamed his sorrows to the same midnight sky that had seen his greatest triumph.Their protectors were dead on the inside, hollowed-out and left to rot, that much was clear. S.H.I.E.L.D. had chosen its first few targets well—the stalwart center of the Avengers remained in the hearts of Phil Coulson and Pepper Potts, and they had stuck a knife right into the crux of their souls.Bruce did not die first. The first blow was one that numbed the mind, culled the Hulk, and left him helpless. Then they killed him, though it may have been an act of mercy at this point.Only the god-king and the last of the team remained, and not for long. Thor died valiant, though he died all the same, a S.H.I.E.L.D. weapon Phil had authorized—the Destroyer gun felled him, the only thing that could kill a god.Pepper and Phil stood together over the things they had left behind. A spare arc reactor, still stubbornly clinging to life. Neither of them knew how to shut it off. The Captain's mighty shield. Clint's bow. Natasha's stingers. Bruce's notebooks and his small, delicate porcelain teakettle.And, for they had assumed they could not lift it and so had abandoned it, Mjolnir itself lay where Thor had thrown it, atop a small obsidian cluster of rock; a last-ditch attempt to save something, someone, when he could not save himself.Pepper looked at Phil with dead, hollow eyes, and the most desolate expression he had ever seen, carved into her face by loss, over and over, working the grooves until she no longer looked human. Phil was sure as he looked back at her that he looked exactly the same under her gaze."We're not dead," Pepper said, and it sounded like blasphemy. "We're...still here. There has to be a reason. You said—""I said they never left a man alive," Phil said. "But we let the Captain die. We don't even deserve that title.""What could we have done?" Pepper snapped. "Do you think I feel any better about Tony, about Bruce, we just—""We could have just stayed," Phil murmured. "But that's not what they wanted. We knew what we were doing when we turned those keys in the ignition and drove. We wer
