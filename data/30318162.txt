July 1997
"He could have died." Ron's voice was broken. Hermione considered her best friend, sitting on the bed across from her and bent over, resting his elbows on his knees. She could see a small wet spot on the floor in between his legs. Another tear fell to the ground, barely making a sound as it hit the wooden slabs. She reached out and squeezed the side of his thigh in support. It was warm, like Ron was.Harry had a hand on his upper back, and his face was contorted in pain and guilt. She knew what Harry was thinking. It was only an ear, but it was close. George almost died in order to move him from the Dursley’s house. Mad-Eye Moody did die. Just a few months ago, Dumbledore had died. Prior to that, Sirius had died. And his parents. All to protect him and to defeat Voldemort, which they weren’t any closer to doing. Harry carried that guilt with him all the time.“Harry?” she asked softly. He glanced up. “Do you have that picture of your parents? The one with the Order members?”She knew he kept it on him all the time. Like his guilt. He nodded without answering and reached around to pull the folded picture out of his pocket, handing it over to her. She sat back in her chair and gently unfolded the picture, scrutinizing the smiling faces of the twenty-somethings that had fought in the First Wizarding War. Only two people were still alive in that picture. One of them was a Death Eater, and the other was downstairs in the Tonks’ kitchen.“I’ll be right back. Ron, can I get you something to eat?”He shook his head silently and Hermione left the guest room, quietly closing the door behind her. She felt distraught. As her feet clunked down the steps towards the kitchen, the reality of their situation started to scare her. Yes, the Order had moved Harry, but they barely made it back to the safe-houses alive and their leader was dead.Again.Everything felt hopeless. Her parents were in Australia and she had a sinking feeling in her stomach that the remaining adults in her life, the ones that were leading this war, that were supposed to provide security and guidance, had no idea what to do.She pushed open the door to the kitchen and stared at Kingsley Shacklebolt, Tonks, Remus Lupin, and Professor McGonagall all sitting around the table. The entryway must have been silenced since she had not heard the conversation which had abruptly stopped when she appeared. The four looked at her, tired and wary.“Who’s leading the Order?” she asked.She guessed it would be Remus now that Moody was dead. McGonagall was Headmistress at Hogwarts, Kingsley was heavily involved at the Ministry, and although Tonks was an Auror, she was still over a decade younger than her husband. Lupin also was not currently employed. In confirmation, everyone’s eyes shifted to him.Remus didn’t seem uncomfortable with the burden of responsibility that had been thrown on him, but it was hard to know if he was covering it up now that she was here. Hermione wondered if these four were the entirety of the Order leadership, sitting right here at the Tonks’ kitchen table, or if there was anyone else.“That would be me, Hermione,” he confirmed his place in Order strata.She nodded and, uninvited, took a seat at the kitchen table. Remus eyed her cautiously, waiting for her to explain her intrusion. She wasn’t sure where to start.“Is everything alright?” he asked.She took a deep breath, and began to voice her worries. “We were outnumbered tonight even though we knew they were coming. Had the Aurors been at the Dursley’s in full capacity, they could have picked up quite a few Death Eaters and thrown them in Azkaban. But they weren’t because you don’t even trust the Auror office. The Auror office,” she repeated emphatically, slightly raising the volume of her voice. “So there’s no hope for the Ministry, is there? And Hogwarts won’t be safe either.”Hermione was breathing heavily at her outburst. She didn’t mean to sound angry, but she was. Not necessarily at them, but at the desperation of their situation.Remus contemplated her and sat back in his chair. “You’re very astute. But there’s no reason to worry yourself about these things. We were simply being cautious.”No one appeared willing to contradict his words. Hermione looked around the table, slightly irritated. Four adults and one seventeen-year-old girl. She felt like she was being patronized.Remus continued. “The Ministry is still functioning and there’s no reason to think that Hogwarts won’t be safe. Minerva will replace Albus as Headmistress and there are several professors there on our side.”“No reason to worry?” Hermione couldn’t believe it. They were all in denial. “It couldn’t be more clear. The Ministry will fall and Hogwarts soon after. The Order is no better than Fudge if you all refuse to think ahead. What’s your plan? Hope for the best? We’ll all be dead. Like Mad-Eye and Dumb
