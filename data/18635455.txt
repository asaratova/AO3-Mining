Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Happy Hogan didn’t know how he went from being a bodyguard of a billionaire to a babysitter in the span of a few years. Actually, he knew exactly how it happened. Said billionaire was kidnapped by terrorists, became a superhero, found some other superheroes to create some kind of superhero team, had a quarrel with his super-friends, recruited a kid that was bitten by a radioactive spider to fight the super-friends – and got attached to the kid. Tony tend to do some weird things, but after working for him for over a decade Happy got kind of used to it.That didn’t mean he liked it.Earlier in the morning – if you could even call that ungodly hour morning – May Parker had called. And when May Parker calls, you answer. It’s one of The Rules that were established after the whole Vulture Incident and, more importantly, after she found out about her nephew’s secret identity. That hadn’t been pretty. Happy had been in the room when May had yelled at Tony for what seemed like hours. It’s been miraculous – he’s never seen his boss just sit quietly while someone screamed at him. Even Pepper would get some banter-that-was-basically-just-flirting in return. The kid had looked like he was this close to a mental breakdown and Happy didn’t blame him.But eventually, after about a month and a bit of no Spider-Manning and The Rules, everything got back to – their kind of – normal. Peter was allowed to do his web shooting vigilante thing but only after school and doing his homework. As soon as his grades would slip, he had to stop. There was a curfew and he had to call in after patrolling; which wasn’t really a new rule as he’d already done that before. Happy had several long voice mails to proof it. Peter spend every other weekend with Tony to upgrade the suit, work on his web fluids, get some basic material arts training, and whatever else a young superhero in training need to learn. Lately, they spend more time in the lab tinkering, playing stupid video games or watching movies. Happy isn’t really sure how that’s part of the superhero training but he hasn’t seen Tony that relaxed in a long time, so he keeps his mouth shut.One of the most important rules was to always, always, pick up the phone if one of the Parkers is calling. Which was the reason Happy was currently in Queens, about to climb up seven flights of stairs – because of course the lift was out of order – to check up on the kid. His aunt had turned to him because Peter hadn’t picked up his phone when she tried call him – she preferred to call Happy instead of Tony because Tony was the complete opposite of subtle and the last thing they need right now were headlines about him visiting some kid in Queens. May was working some insane shifts at the hospital which was why Peter was on his own in the mornings as well as the evenings and better parts of the night. Tony had offered to let him stay at the Tower, but May didn’t trust him to stick to the curfews without Pepper around to make sure both teenager and billionaire would get the proper amount of sleep. So, the kid was mostly alone and his aunt would call in to make sure that he was awake and getting ready for school. It was a system that had worked before and seemed to work now – until this morning.Peter hadn’t picked up when she called in to make sure he was getting ready for school. Not the first time, not the second time, and not the third time. He said he hadn’t been injured on patrol, May’s words rang in Happy’s ears, but you know how he is. Please just make sure he is okay. It was a reasonable request. The kid had a history of hiding injuries and down playing everything.When Happy reached the seventh floor, his knees hurt and he was more out of breath than he would like to be. Getting old sucked. He was already mildly irritated as he reached the Parker Apartment but before he could even raise his hand to knock the door swung open and revealed a shocked Peter Parker, hair sticking out in every direction, tooth brush hanging out of one corner of his mouth, clad in a familiar New York tourist shirt and Hello Kitty pajama pants. “My phone is dead,” he said, not bothering to take the tooth brush out of his mouth. “My alarm didn’t go off and I didn’t get May’s calls and I just woke up because I heard your car outside and –““Hey, kid, try to get some breath between all of those words, alright?” Happy interrupted him, his face already pulled in an annoyed grimace. He raced down to Queens for this? A teenager who overslept? However, he couldn’t help but let his eyes scan the boy for any sign of injuries. There were none that he could see and Peter didn’t seem to be in any sort of pain. The tension that had settled in his shoulders since he got May’s call eased away. “How did your phone even die? I thought phones are more important than air for the kids these days.”“I don’t know!” Peter said, ranking a hand through his hair – which did not help him to look more awake – and finally took the b
