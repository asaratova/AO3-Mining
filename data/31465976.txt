Chapter 1: The Beginning
    




Chapter Text
 You huffed a little, groaning as you pushed forward walking.  The sunsetting behind you over the Brooklyn skyline, the sky brilliant hues of orange, purples, and pinks. Just a few more blocks down the street till you reached your apartment. Your feet ached, tired, from a long shift at the hospital, taking care of patients. You were thankful though. It was a job, and this one didn't often require you to stick your fingers into bullet wounds, or hold down an artery. You were thankful for the feeding tubes, and the bed pans, and the broken bones. The normalcy of it all.You had been stationed in Europe, a combat nurse, stationed wherever they sent you. Your husband had been drafted to be a solider, and you couldn't bear the idea of sitting home alone doing nothing. So you worked. You worked hard everyday. You saw the men dying, held their hands, sang to them, kissed their brows, pretended to be their mothers, their wives, whoever they needed in their moments of need. You hoped someone had been that for your Ted, before he had died in the war. Now it was only you. Stateside in a little apartment in Brooklyn.And right now all you needed was a glass of wine, and your bed. You heard a cry, and you ran toward it. A little blonde haired boy, with bright blue eyes sprawled out on the pavement, bicycle tangled in his limbs."Are you alright sweetheart?"  You said coming down to his level, nursing instincts kicking in. He sniffled a bit, trying to fight back tears, but it was too late. The tears had already started to flow, covering his sweet face. "Oh I've got you sweetheart. You're okay." You hushed him, removing the fallen bicycle from him. He couldn't be more than 6 years old. You looked at him, two scraped knees, a small abrasion on his hand, but his head looked intact, his pupils reactive. "Lets get you cleaned up," You lifted the boy from the ground, onto his feet, dragging the bicycle beside you.  "My apartment is just down the street. You can sit on the stoop and I'll bring out some stuff to clean you up."The boy nodded, still sniffling. "Whats your name sweetheart?" "Steven Junior. But Daddy just calls me junior." You smiled at him"Well Junior, I'm Y/N, and it's very nice to meet you." You sat him on your stoop, and quickly ran inside dropping your bag, and grabbing a basin of water, a bottle of peroxide and the small first-aid kit you kept in your kitchen. You had cleaned up all of his cuts and were finishing wrapping his hand up, when you saw the tall man running down the street, and you held in a breath. He was broad, blonde like the little boy in front of you and somehow built like a god, with the bluest eyes you had ever seen, and you instantly knew that he must be Junior’s father. You swallowed hard. He was beautiful. “Junior!” The man called out.“Daddy!” He leapt off the stoop and into his father's arms. “Gosh, you scared me. How’d you get all the way down here?”“Some boys had been chasing me on their bikes. I tried to get away.”“Oh buddy." The man set him down and  glanced him over. "Are you okay?”He sniffled a little but nodded. “Y/N cleaned me up.” "Is that so?"Your breath hitched as his gaze met yours. You slowly nodded. "Yes, just a few bumps and bruises. Nothing a little rest, a few bandaids and and some ice can't fix." "Thank you for taking care of him." He smiled at you."No trouble really." You grinned back, feeling butterflies build in your stomach. "I'm Steve." He reaches out a hand."Y/N L/N" you introduce yourself, reaching your hand out. Your smaller hand fits in his perfectly, and you felt a shock jolt through you. Did he feel it too?"Junior, did you say thank you?""Thank You Mrs. L/N" "It's Miss. Just me. And you're very welcome." You smiled at the boy. "Grab your bicycle. We have to head home and get someone ready for bed soon.""But I'm not tired Daddy," he mumbled through a yawn, causing you to hold back a small laugh."Listen to your Daddy." you said. "I'm sure he's just happy to have you back safe.""I am." Steve smiled at you. He looked you up and down, examining your dress, your cap sitting beside you.  "You're a nurse?" "Yes. At the hospital uptown."  "Well Junior was lucky to have fallen in front of a beautiful educated nurse like you who was able to take care of him." You blushed under his praise, feeling the heat rise to your cheeks. "Really it was nothing. I'm always happy to help.""Let me thank you. How about you come over for dinner tomorrow night? Our place."Your mouth goes dry for a moment, so instead of using your words you just nod. "Yes, that sounds lovely.""Great. I'll send a car to pick you up around 7?" "A car?" Your eyes widened. "Got a lot of connections, its no big deal. Really.  And I don't want you walking by yourself late at night. A pretty young thing like you? Could be trouble." "I can take care of myself. Have been doin' so for a while." You say defensively, before you take a breath. "But I do appreciate the offer, a
