Chapter 1: Part I
    




Chapter Text
Clint had thought that Pepper was joking about etiquette class. It was only when Natasha was pulling him out of the car, dragging him into a brick building, and pushing him into a room filled with kids that he realized she had been dead serious.“What the heck.”“Have fun!” Natasha said, and promptly left. He gave her a deeply betrayed look as she strode out the door. Clint sighed the heaviest of all sighs, stared at the ceiling for a few seconds, and made his way to sit at the very back of the room. The table had four chairs, and one was already occupied by a girl that looked about eight.“You’re a grown-up,” she said, tilting her head in a manner that reminded Clint of Peter.“I am.”“What are you doing here? Don’t you already know manners?”“Apparently not,” Clint said. The girl giggled.“Did your moms tell you that you eat like a pig too?”Clint shook his head. “My friend did.”“None of my friends would send me to manners class. You friend doesn’t sound very nice,” the girl said scornfully. Clint laughed a little.“She’s secretly nice.”The girl looked dubious.“I’m Clint.”“I’m Clara,” the girl said, her face brightening. “Our names start with the same letter!”“The second letter is the same, too,” said Clint.“Clara and Clint,” Clara said with a wide smile.Out of the corner of his eye, Clint noticed the room staring to fill up. A boy edged over to their table, and Clara squinted at him, assessing.“What letter does you name start with?”“How come?” the boy asked, looking just as suspicious.“‘Cause ours start with C. This is the C table.”The boy’s face lit up. “I’m Caleb!”Clara looked pleased. “I’m Clara. You can sit next to Clint. He’s a grown-up, but he still has bad manners.”“My papa says I have bad manners, but I don’t think so,” Caleb said. “I think he’s just being picky.”“Do you chew with your mouth open? I do sometimes. I forget a lot.”“I guess sometimes,” Caleb admitted. He turned to Clint. “Do you?”“Not often, but I talk with my mouth full,” Clint said. “That’s a no-no.”Clara nodded seriously. “My moms hate that.”“So do my friends.”“Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please! I’m going to call roll. Respond by saying ‘present’ when I say your name!” Clint was one of the first on the list; his last name started with B, so that was standard. Everyone stared at him a bit, which he understood, but didn’t particularly enjoy. It was awkward, being the only adult in a room full of children. The next-oldest person looked about fourteen.“We’re going to begin with the basics: introductions. I’ll begin. Hello, my name is Mrs. Raymond. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ll be your teacher for the next three Thursday evenings. We’ll learn everything from table manners to polite behaviors, and at the end, your parents will be invited to a dinner where you can show your progress. I expect your complete attention and respect for the next two hours. Is everyone ready to begin?”There was a spattering of agreement, and Mrs. Raymond frowned.“Let’s try that again. When I ask a question, please reply with ‘yes, Mrs. Raymond’ or ‘no, Mrs. Raymond’. Is everyone ready to begin?”“Yes, Mrs. Raymond,” the class chorused. Mrs. Raymond smiled.“Excellent. Now, I want each of you to politely introduce yourself to those at your table by saying hello, your name, and that it’s nice to meet your groupmates. Begin.”----When Natasha came to retrieve Clint two hours later, she seemed to be trying to keep a blank face, but the corners of her mouth were twitching.“Did you have a good time?”Clint glared, but he wasn’t angry. “I made some friends,” he admitted.“Did you? Good job.”“Clara and Caleb. They’re cool. We’re the C table.”Natasha let out a rare, tinkling laugh. “Good for you. You won me twenty bucks.”“Huh?”“Tony bet ten bucks that you’d try to escape, and Hill bet ten that you’d sulk the whole time. I bet that you’d stay and secretly have a good time. I win.”“I’m offended,” Clint replied, but he was smiling. “You guys blackmailed me, but technically I did promise Pepper. I know better than to break a promise to Pepper.”“Atta boy. C’mon, let’s go home. Peter introduced Bucky to Legos, and now there’s a castle in the living room.”“Really?” Clint asked, excited.“You’re such a child,” said Natasha, shaking her head as Clint followed her towards the car.“Bye, Clint!” a little voice shouted, and Clint could see Caleb waving wildly from the next row of cars.“Bye, Caleb!” Clint called, grinning. “I’ll see you next week!”
