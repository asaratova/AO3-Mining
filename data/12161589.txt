Chapter 1: Catatonia
    




Chapter Text
Loki didn't know who had put him here, it could be nearly anybody. Nobody had much love for him anymore. The very few people he had count on in the past were either gone or had shown him that they wanted nothing to do with him. He knew he had brought it on himself, but still hurt. The fact the hadn't been able to make a single true friend in all his years, and in all the realms he had visited. Something that come so easy for most of the being in the universe, and yet, he was alone, always alone, and had to force people, put them under mind control if he wanted to be kept company. The people he'd shared years of his life with on Asgard bore no love for him, and were quick to find ways to get rid of him quick as lightning. And his family... Funnily enough, he imagined that, like most adopted children, he had two families, the biological one and the adoptive one. And yet... Both his fathers were a lost cause: he had killed Laufey trying to please Odin and Odin had shown once and again how little he tolerated him. How glad he would be, he too, to never have to lay eyes on him ever again. Frigga had still cared a bit when she died. And he couldn't say goodbye properly and she was taken from all of them. He couldn't make up for all the wrong things he'd done and said to her, and she no longer could look at him feeling something other than repulse. They'd lost each other, in a bitter way and Loki regretted and missed. (But she too had lied to him all of his life... whatever her motives, she must have known... she was a wise woman, why would she...) He couldn't even think about her without being overwhelmed by sorrow, and grief. Losing Thor too (while it was a less permanent loss) had hurt even more. At least, when he told him he was going to kill him, that he was ready for his betrayal, he seemed to care, even if only slightly. Now there wasn't even that. Thor had shown him that he felt nothing for him anymore, that he was less than a stranger. Thor had forsaken him, his eternal companion, the one that had called himself his brother for all those years....And now, nothing. So he couldn't on him to get him out, and if he couldn't count on Thor he couldn't count on anyone. He realised soon after he was thrown in that dark dungeon, that only his jailers would be able to change his fate. If they decided that he was to rot in that windowless cell for all eternity, then rot he would. Those who knew him would probably assume he was dead (finally) and celebrate his death in a way in which they never celebrated his life. Again, it hurt. Knowing how irreparably alone in the universe he was hurt more than all the tortures his nondescript captors threw at him: more than the drowning and reviving, more than the scorching flames and the acid, more than the thread of metal on his lips to keep him quiet. Also those did hurt, too. Loki thought he wouldn't be able to feel pain by now. In many aspects, the body got used to the treatment it received, the more one was in cold places, the less they felt it, because they'd grown accustomed to it. And there were a fair number of things Loki hardly registered anymore, but pain... He knew that he could withstand much more than any mortals and probably more than most Asgardians, but still there was a point in which he could nothing but scream and thrash and hope for the quick release of death. He had lost track of time somewhere after seven or eight months had passed, but he knew those guards had been torturing him for a fairly long time. It started with fairly common things, the choking, the ripping off his nails, the bucket in which they intermittently drowned him. Then they saw that they were burning him like they wanted to and they started getting creative. The fire was painful, but the acid was much more horrible. It crawled under his skin, and travelled through his body, like liquid agony. He could feel and see his limbs being eating away by it, he could smell it and he there was nothing he could do to escape it. They poured it everywhere, and then again, over his half healed wounds. They broke many bones, too, and put him in a sort of target to be punched, kicked and thrown things. This was not as painful but it was horrendously humiliating. Having him paraded there, with his mouth shut so he couldn't even complain about it... That broke him as badly as the acid of the fire did. And it never end. Days stretched over nights, until he almost longed for the sight of his captors. At least, that way, he would know that he was alive and wouldn't have to endure his own excruciating thoughts. He knew that he was alone, and he knew that it was his own doing, but the thing was that he didn't think he would have done anything differently given the chance. He was destined for that, for doom, for solitude, to end up and as one his enemy's plaything, living through indescribably pain of all types for the rest of his days. There was no hope, not anymore. At
