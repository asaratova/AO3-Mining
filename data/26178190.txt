Chapter 1: One (Act I)
    


Notes:
*sings* Guess who’s back… back again… Shady’s Nela’s back… tell a friend…Jk, but seriously, I can’t even explain to you how fucking touched I was by your amazing feedback to the finale. I still can’t cope and I got the biggest motivation boost in history to start the well-requested sequel (to the sequel), so here’s chapter one 💕--Warnings: Please be aware that this story will deal with heavy topics like PTSD and everything that comes with it (including stuff that can be very triggering, especially if you’ve ever had to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts).Peter’s recovery won’t be easy, and he’ll be struggling not just with his trauma, but also with the Stockholm Syndrome he developed. There will also be explicit descriptions/mentions about past sexual abuse and torture. And I can’t promise we won’t see anything violent or sexual in this as well because that would be a spoiler ;)--Thanks to Harishe for beta-reading, and to Sternenzauber for coming up with the title “Deprivation of Sanity” 💕 My dear friends from Discord had a few nice suggestions as well, so thanks to you guys too 💕

Chapter Text
Tony has never felt so many various emotions all at once. Fury. Physical Pain. Fear. Emotional Pain. Despair. Groaning, he opens his eyes, looking right at the ceiling of his kitchen. The left side of his face is burning like hell, but it’s nothing compared to the blinding agony he feels ‘down there’. It's a pain unlike anything Tony has ever felt before - and he had gotten all different kinds of injuries in the last four decades, including burns he received from his father, who liked to use Tony’s skin as an ashtray for his cigarettes whenever he was in a  really bad  mood. Adding to the physical distress are all these conflicting feelings which are tormenting him. Feelings regarding Peter. His perfect, broken boy, who, as it turns out, was neither perfect, nor broken. At least not broken enough.After all, Peter still had enough willpower and strength in him to turn on Tony and plan a daring escape. He fooled Tony, beating him at his own game, with his own tech. And now, the boy is either as good as dead or on his way to safety, in which case Tony and his friends would need to get off this fucking island as fast as they can.The man has no idea how much time has passed since Peter has  scorched his crotch, but since he can still make out all his furniture without the lights on, it can’t be that late yet. Did Peter manage to start the engine of the boat? Is he…  really gone?   God, he already misses him.  Struggling against his bonds, Tony tries to move, but he’s forced to give up right away. It hurts too fucking much. Feeling desperate, Tony tries to yell, but the tape is sealing his mouth shut, forcing him to lay there and wait, fighting to stay conscious. Rhodey will know something happened if Tony doesn’t show up at 8:00 pm... won’t he? However, even if he finds him, it might be too late...Although Tony wants to beat the fucking kid to a bloody pulp right now, the thought of Peter flipping over and dying a lonely death at sea, lost for all eternity, is unbearable. Swallowing down the lump in his throat, Tony thinks back to the last conversation they might have ever had. It hurt so much to hear all the pain, disgust, and hatred in Peter’s voice. but what hurt even more was realizing that the boy had been playing him. During the last couple of weeks, Peter acted as if he  liked  Tony as well. And Tony - idiot in love that he  is  was - fell for it. When did it all go  wrong? Peter had been so broken and  tame  until- The wedding.  Of course. Peter asked Tony to let him join them on the boat trip, and then he initiated sex at the bonfire. And right after Tony told him about Wakanda, Peter claimed that he felt good around him and that he  liked it when Tony called him names. So this is why Peter eagerly offered to tidy the whole house. He was trying to find every single camera and surely deactivated one of them on purpose so he could find out what would happen. That’s why Peter knew JARVIS would be sounding the alarm if the power was on.The little shit had been planning it for weeks, taking Tony for a complete fool... 
 Oh, he’s going to kill that son of a bitch. 
Driven by a raging desire for vengeance, Tony somehow gains enough strength to roll onto his stomach, only to almost pass out at the excruciating pain radiating from his crotch. Maybe it’s good that it hurts… If it hurts, not all nerves are burned off. And yet, what if the burns are so severe that Tony can never get another erection or orgasm again?A very tiny, honest part inside of Tony can’t help thinking that this punishment is the least he deserves for the way he treated Peter, but he immediately scolds himself for it. He must not have thoughts like these. Being nice and somewhat "decent" is what got him into this situation in the first
