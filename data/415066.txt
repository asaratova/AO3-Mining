As usual, Tony suspects absolutely nothing until it’s already too late.Well, no, “too late” definitely sounds way too dire for this situation. He’s not under attack or anything, the world isn’t in danger, and he could still back out if he wanted to (not fucking likely). But it does annoy him just a bit that he had no clue what was happening until it was, well, happening. He could have had days, maybe even weeks, of delicious, delicious anticipation, built up some awesome fantasies, planned and re-planned and played out the whole thing in his head, if only he had figured out what Pepper was up to.But really, who the hell expects their (wonderful, amazing, too perfect for words) girlfriend to understand how much they actually meant it when they said they wanted a gangbang for their birthday?Pepper is smirking, leaning oh-so-casually against the kitchen counter, and after what she’s just told him about her plans for the evening there’s nothing Tony can do but kiss her. She laughs against his mouth, hands settling lightly on his shoulders, smoothing over his t-shirt.“Thank you,” he says when his brain has composed itself enough to form words. “You are the best, the best, I don’t know— I can’t even, how awesome you are, I mean, I should build you a monument, call it the monument of awesome girlfriends—““That’s probably more publicity than this little party needs,” Pepper says. “TMZ has enough fun spreading rumors about just the two of us; just think of all the trouble they could cause if they knew I’d invited over all your superhero friends to fuck you until you scream.”Tony has to kiss her again, just until that mental image clears his system, but before he’s recovered his powers of speech the doorbell rings. Pepper slips away from him, walking calmly over to answer it.“Steve, hi,” she says from the entryway, and Tony relaxes a little, because Steve’s joined them in bed a few times before — and every time had been a night to remember, hoo boy. If anyone besides Steve had been the first to arrive (which, realistically, was never going to happen: Steve is allergic to being late, or something, always had to show up five minutes early and ten times more prepared than anyone else), things could’ve gotten awkward fast, but Tony can deal with seeing Steve first. Steve is a known entity.Except he’s holding a bouquet of flowers, for some reason, which is just weird.“Planning on wooing me before you take me to your bed?” Tony asks, his mouth running away from him as usual. “Or my bed, technically — although I’m not totally sure the frame is going to support — Pepper, where are we doing this?”“In the upstairs lounge,” she answers. “I got the whole thing set up while you were down in the workshop earlier, don’t worry about it.”“The flowers are for Pepper, actually,” Steve says, finally managing to get a word in edgewise. “For being kind enough to invite me.” He hands her the bouquet, smiling warmly, then directs his attention back to Tony. “For you, I brought something else.”What? Steve has a shit-eating grin on his face, what does he— oh, no, seriously? He wouldn’t, would he? “Yeah? Where is it?” Tony asks, feeding Steve the line just to see if he’s actually going to take the bait.Steve’s grin widens. “In my pants.”Oh, jeez, of course he would. “Steve, dude, we have got to work on your pick-up lines,” Tony says as the doorbell rings again. “I know you’re probably really proud of that one, but you are not actually eleven years old, you’re going to have to step up your game if you want anyone who wasn’t already planning on sleeping with you to say yes—oh my god, Pepper, you got Banner to come?”Bruce holds up a hand. “As an observer only, unfortunately,” he says. “At least until I’m sure the other guy isn’t going to be making a surprise appearance.”“Good plan,” Tony says, wincing. “Still, glad you could make it. And hey, watching can be fun too, right?”“I’ll be rating you all on form and creativity,” Bruce says, totally deadpan. “I’ve come up with an eight-point scoring system, it should work nicely for something with this level of complexity.”“Discrete or continuous scale?”“Logarithmic, actually.”“You’ll have to explain it to me afterwards.”“I’ll send you my spreadsheets.”“Enough shop talk, boys, you’re scaring the non-scientists in attendance,” Pepper says. Steve looks at her gratefully. “Why don’t we break out the pizza?”They talk about other things while they eat. Tony’s not really sure what, because his mind is all over the damn place, zooming around between wondering who’s going to walk through the door next and what kind of setup Pepper’s worked out upstairs and is Bruce actually going to just watch him have sex with the rest of the team, there’s got to be a way to get him involved safely and where does Steve get these awful plaid shirts, maybe Tony should rip this one off of him but no, he’d probably just collect up all the buttons to sew them back on and be annoyed at Tony for the rest of the night.
