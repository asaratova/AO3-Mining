Chapter Text
If he’s being completely honest, this isn’t that bad.	When he first started picking the kid up from school to take him to the Compound, Happy Hogan admits it was partially because he felt bad for the incident with the plane. He’d come over, pick him up, and roll up the partition when the chatter got annoying.	Eventually, Hogan started to realize that it took longer for him to feel the need for silence. Soon, he began making it to the Compound without even reaching for the button for the partition. Then, he started participating in the conversation with the kid. Talking about the boss and what they do in the lab, even if he barely understands it. Happy would tell stories about Tony that would make the kid laugh. He still hasn’t caved on the “no eating” rule that he has for his car, but he will admit that he looks forward to pulling up at this high school a few times a week.	Now, however, he isn’t glad to be hear. No, he’s quite annoyed.	All of Tony Stark’s cars are nice. As in, very nice. Not always the most expensive, but always very good to look at. He allows a slight decrease in quality for when he needs to be a little lower profile, but only just.	Happy has a few preferences when he drives. Has to be black. Has to have a backseat. Must have trunk space. Finally, tinted windows are preferred.	The problem is, most of the car’s he usually drives to pick up the kid are in some form of maintenance at the moment. Leaving him to drive one of those high-profile cars that Stark would be seen in.	So, now, he’s leaning against that car, waiting for his charge as a crowd starts to gather around the flashy and not at all under the radar vehicle. They all gape and stare, but Happy likes to think that his intimidating stature keeps them from getting too close.	He’s looking around, scanning for possible threats, when he sees Peter walking out of the double doors of the school with the Leeds kid. Pete spots Happy, and his face splits into a wide grin. He starts walking down towards the car, when it happens.	Peter Parker goes sprawling to the ground as a group of guys shoves past the kid, despite there being more than enough room. No, it was intentional.	“Hey!”	The bodyguard bolts forward, barely even noticing as the brats in front of him part to let him through. He stalks towards the group of kids that are now laughing at his charge while Leeds helps him up. The entire group doesn’t notice the man until he’s standing between the bullies and the two friends.	“What’s your problem?” Happy Hogan growls.	“What?” The group steps back, a bit of fear on their faces.	“Happy,” Peter sighs, wiping dust and dirt off of his clothes. “It’s okay.”	“Kid,” the man looks back at him. “It’s my job to make sure that you get to the boss safely. If that means stepping between you and a bunch of guys who seem to enjoy picking on others, then so be it.”	“Happy,” Peter grabs onto the man’s arm. “Please, can we just go?”	The Asset Manager of Stark Industries, former bodyguard of Tony Stark, and retired pro boxer looks back and forth between the kid and the jerks, before sighing.	“Fine, but I’m telling the boss about this.”	“But-.”	“Nope. Not hearing it. And your aunt is learning this, too.”	“Please, don’t.”	“It's happening, now c’mon. Tony’s always a bit anxious when we’re late.” He looks over at Ned, nodding. “Leeds.” Then, over at the others, glaring slightly, before walking away with Peter.***	“And you didn’t think to tell us about this why?”	Peter is looking down as Tony Stark and May Parker sit across the table from him.	“Peter,” May gives him a comforting look. “If you’re getting bullied at school, you should have told us. Was it that Flash person?”	“No,” the teen mumbles. “He only calls me names sometimes, and that’s not really specific to me. He’s a jerk to everyone equally.”	“That means that there are others who do target just you?” Mr. Stark frowns.	The teenager being lectured sinks down even lower.	“Sweetie,” May tries to look in Peter’s eyes. “Why do they do that? If it’s just you, I would think they’d have a reason, right?”	Peter nods. “Some people, well… Some of the people at school still don’t believe I have an internship.”	“What?” Tony actually chuckles at that. “I thought all of that was settled when we turned in the paperwork to make it official.”	“It was for most people,” Peter sighs. “Like Principal Morita and most of the staff, but some people think I forged the papers. It’s apparently happened before. I mean, this is a STEM school, so there would be people smart enough to do that.”	“I will admit that with your knowledge of chemistry, engineering, and programming,” Tony Stark nods. “You’d definitely be able to pull off a passable false internship report.”	“But that isn’t the case right now,” May frowns. “Have the teachers done anything about this?”	“When they actually catch the guys doing it.”	For the next h
