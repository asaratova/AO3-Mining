Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 I was eighteen when the Red Room sent me on my first long term mission. I had done undercover before but not like this. They didn't tell me much beforehand, other than I was to play the part of a teenage daughter. Some guard got me from the training room and handed me a suitcase to take with me on my mission. It was full of classic teenage clothes. Or what I assume are classic teenage clothes. But there was a false bottom to it that was concealing small weapons. I was blindfolded until I got to the place I'd be staying for however long this mission takes.The guards left once I was inside the house. It was a nice house. Living room wasn't too big and it had a second floor. There was an older widow and a guy standing in the living room conversing..  I didn't do anything, I put my bag down next to me and waited for them to speak.The woman saw me first and walked over."You must be Natalia, I'm Melina" She said. Her voice was soft yet firm. Melinda reached out to shake my hand.I shook hers. "It's nice to meet you too ma'am." I said stiffly. If this Melina was going to be my new handler I had to be on her good side. "No need for the ma'am. I am not your handler. Not here. You may call me Melina, mom in public."The idea of calling her mom was something I hadn't gotten used to. I knew the premise of this mission and yet I still wasn't prepared for it. I nodded. "Yes Melina" We stayed there staring at each other for far longer than we should have before we were interrupted by the man behind her."I'm alexie. Your brand new dad." He said. This guy was big and he knew it. Not just height wise but also personality wise. I could see it in the way he walked. Like he was on top of the world. Like everyone around him is just blessed because he's there. I already didn't like him.Melina rolled her eyes at him "You can put your stuff in your room. Then come back down, we have to wait for Yelena"I did as I was told but my mind wandered to who this 'Yelena' could be.The room I'd be staying in was pretty bare. Just a bed in the corner near the window, a closet, and a desk right across. The walls were a beige color and the carpet was gray. Whoever packed my suitcase did a good enough job. It was full of striped t-shirts,hoodies,jeans, a skirt or two and some undergarments. All in all, not bad. I put the clothes away, leaving the weapons inside the case and shoving that under the bed. Then I went downstairs.Melina and Alexei were looking over a binder at the kitchen table. I didn't want to barge in on them so to speak so I knocked on the wall. Alexei laughed "No need for that girly come here." He said waving me over.The binder was the mission broken down. They needed to get in with Shield and delete everything they knew about the Red Room. Simple enough.My mission was to literally just play the part of daughter. I had no other goal here. Which was annoying because I'm a highly trained spy and they sent me to play pretend.The doorbell rang and Melina got up to get it. I followed her, the door opened to reveal one guard and a little blonde girl clutching a stuffed pony.I've never interacted with kids that young, she was so small. She clearly had no idea where she was because she looked so happy to be here. I felt bad for her. The guard pushed her in the front door then left. The girl stood there watching everyone in the room with a smile.Melina approached her first. She bent down to her level and matched her smile. "Hello Yelena. I'm your new mommy, I like your pony." "Her name is Gary," Yelena said."That's a good name. Nice and strong."  Melina said. She stood up grabbing Yelena's hand.They stopped in front of me. "This is Natalia, she's your sister.""Hi Natli" Yelena mumbled.I was not here to make friends. This kid was not my problem. I had one goal. No attachments. I'd be sent back to the Red Room after this. No point in caring for people I'd never see again.The day came and went. After dinner I was dismissed to my room. There wasn't anything I could use to occupy my time. So I grabbed a notepad from the bookshelf in the living room. I started doodling on the paper with a black pen when my door was nudged open.Immediately I hid the notepad and sat up straight on my bed. However there was no yelling or orders being shouted at me. It was just Yelena. The little girl had her thumb in her mouth and her pony, 'Gary' in her other hand.She didn't wait for an invitation inside, she just came in and sat on my bed. I was almost jealous of how easily she trusted people. She wasn't scared of me. She should be, I've killed hundreds of men, I've killed kids her age and I didn't even know her age."Whatcha doin Natli"? She asked, looking at me.Even i couldn't lie, she was cute. "Nothing. Why are you in my room?"She shrugged and laid back on my bed as if it was her own. "This isn't your bed. Go to Mel-mom" It was going to be hard not to forget that Yelena was not in on the mission.She whined as if it was some terrible h
