Chapter Text
It felt good to finally be home, life in the jungle was nice enough but it was nothing like being back state side where home was. He and the others had just arrived back to the New York Avengers Base, Wanda and Clint immediately went up to Vision before wondering off somewhere. Sam took an awestruck Scott off to find a room where he could unpack which left Steve and Bucky standing in the living quarter’s entrance.Natasha wondered in just then, “Welcome home boys.”“Thanks Nat, it feels good to be back. Where are the others?” They had heard that some new people had moved in and joined the avengers but Steve was more concerned with seeing just one person.“He’s in the training room.” She smirked at the blonde with an all knowing smile and then adverted her attention to the quiet man beside him. She inclined her body in the direction of the sleeping quarters, prompting his best friend to grab his stuff so he could get settled in. With Bucky taken care of who also took his duffel bag for him, he made his way to the open training room that all the avengers used.It was a across the yard, keeping separate from the living quarters but Steve made it there in ample time. He had to slow his pace, not wanting to look over eager before he pushed the doors open. He heard the man before he saw him, “Hey Ton-” he stopped abruptly.There was someone with the genius, and he was standing right behind Tony. As in, back to chest, the taller man had a fancy beard like Tony but the style was different, he stood with his arms around the billionaire. Both of their arms held up as something glowed between the engineer’s open palms, his face was being illuminated by the golden glow of whatever the man behind him was creating.A bright smile was spread across the smaller man’s face, unconcerned with the body pressed along his back. Something dark sparked through his chest before he pushed it aside and marched over. “Tony!” He spoke the name a little rougher than he intended but it got the other two men’s attention.“Steve, hi, welcome back Cap.” The glow disappeared and Tony stepped from the others arms, meeting him halfway. When they were within reaching distance Tony stuck out a hand to shake. They had been talking while he was away in Wakanda working out apologies and working to be friends again. But Steve had missed the other man greatly so instead of just settling for a hand shake he used his grasp on the other to tug him forward into a hug. The smaller man was tense against him but still returned the hug.“I missed you,” he confessed to the other, tightening his grip around the other a fraction before letting him go, but he did keep his hands on the others arms.He chuckled weakly, “Steve, I talked to you like 3 days ago.”“Yeah, but it’s not the same.” He was going to say more when the man from before stepped forward.“Hello Captain Rogers, I don’t believe we’ve been introduced. I am Doctor Stephen Strange.”Reluctantly he drew away from Tony to address the other guy. “Nice meeting you Strange.” He kept his smile polite but there hand shake was a little rougher on both ends and kept short.“Stephen’s one of our new recruits, he specializes in magic. Have you met the others yet?” Tony was completely oblivious to the tension between the two.“No, we just got in not to shortly. I was actually wondering if you were interesting in grabbing some food.” He turned his attention back to Tony, smiling warmly down at him.“Is it dinner time already? I guess since there’s so many of us we can order in some pizzas. Come on, let’s go find the others.” Tony made for the exit, Strange not sparing him another glance, choosing instead to follow after Tony. Steve felt his jaw and hands clench before trialed along behind the others.-Later on after the pizza had arrived and everyone had been introduced Steve found himself grinding his teeth at what he was seeing.Quill, the leader of The Guardians was hanging all over Tony in the kitchen, clinging to him like so needy child that wanted attention. “Toooooonnyy, please.”“No Peter, I have enough on my plate as it is, I’m not adding a flying car to my list of projects.”“You’re no fun,” he pouted, head resting on Tony’s shoulder as he clung to his waist.“You’ll get over it, now stop pouting, grab your food and go sit down.” He untangled himself from the other with his plate and drink, heading into the living room to sit beside Rhodes who he had also made a plate for. Steve watched as Quill prepared his food before going after the other and sitting in the spot next to Tony. He sat as close to the genius, body pressed up all along the other and throwing an arm around him. Tony didn’t even pause in his rambling to Rhodes, acting
