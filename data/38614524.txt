Work Text:
Steve is slinging the shield on his back when Bucky comes out of the bedroom, knife between his teeth as he fastens the last of his tac vest’s many buckles. Their gun locker opens for Bucky’s arsenal. And, as always, Bucky selects a simple 9mm and holds it out to Steve.“No,” Steve says, like always. “I don’t use guns.”Bucky rolls his eyes. “Just carry it,” he suggests. “For my peace of mind.”“Carrying a gun makes you more likely to get shot,” Steve argues. Bucky kisses him between the eyes. “If that were true, I’d be swiss cheese.”
