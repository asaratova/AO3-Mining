Chapter 1: Jealousy is Red (Wanda Maximoff)
    




Chapter Text

The training ring was spacious, granting you plenty of room to inch around as you stared at the recruit across from you. In a different world, you might have thought she was cute - blonde hair, chocolate eyes, and a flirty smirk on her lips - but your heart belonged to another and that wasn't going to change (even if said person didn't know about your feelings).

She advanced towards you, throwing series of quick punches that you easily deflected. Either she hadn't taken your training serious or she just wasn't trying because a child could have defended against that. She went for your legs, dropping low to try and sweep them out from under you, but you hopped over it and knocked her flat onto her back. You offered her your hand to lift her up, but she turned the tables on you and brought you down onto the mat. She straddled your hips, a playful smirk tugging at her mouth. 

"I could get used to this," she purred, earning an awkward blush.

"Uh, I don't think so," you muttered back, watching a pout fall over her face. You were terribly uncomfortable. You didn't like the position you'd found yourself in. It shouldn't be some random agent straddling you, it should be…

What you were completely unaware of was Wanda staring at you. Her eyes were red, a dangerous glint overcoming them as she took in the compromising position. She hated seeing you like that; you looked so out of your comfort zone and it was evident the woman was prepared to stay on your hips for as long as she could. Red mist played at the tips of her fingers, itching to separate you.

"I think that's enough training for now," you coughed, nudging the woman off your lap.

The agent frowned, but stood, her hands behind her back. "How'd I do?" she batted her eyes at you.

"You did fine," you replied, scratching the back of your neck. The other agents watching were snickering; she was known for trying to sleep her way to the top and you were a good wrung on that ladder, being an Avenger. 

The agent nodded, her hand falling to your limp arm. "Well, I had a great teacher."

"Anyways," you clapped your hands together, effectively cutting off contact. "Training is over for the day. Return to your normal duties and we'll pick up sparring tomorrow."

The other agents filtered out of the room at a fast pace, concerned you'd change your mind and make them continue their rigorous workout, but you had no plans for that. Honestly, you just wanted to get away from the woman still standing in the middle of the ring! 

You smiled anxiously. "Yes?"

"How can I get better? I feel like I'm not really doing fine."

"Well," you relaxed a little; the conversation was staying in a safe place, "You have to stop choreographing your moves. It's easy to knock you off your game when you do that."

Nodding, she stepped closer. "Is there any way you could give me some private training? I'd love to get better."

Swallowing hard, you glanced away from her. The Avenger part of you wanted to help the agent, but the logical part of you knew that she had something other than training on her mind. "I don't think that's such a good idea."

"It'll be a great idea, I promise," she argued, leaning in to kiss your cheek.

Wanda snapped. She wasn't going to let some random agent do what she'd been wanting to do for months. Using her powers, she forced the two of you apart, sending the agent flying back onto the mat. You were stunned, but so very thankful. You hadn't realized Wanda was there, but God were you glad she was.

Strolling over to you, Wanda slipped into the ring and grabbed your hand, dragging you out of there. She wasn't going to wait for the agent to rise or ask for a hand up. Nope, she was done waiting. Watching you with her was the last straw.

You followed her out of the room without protest, not even casting a glance backward to see if the agent was okay. The woman whose name was written on your heart was holding your hand and that's what mattered. She tangled your fingers together and your lips ticked up, a smitten smile playing there. 

Stopping in the hallway, Wanda shoved you up against the wall and pinned you there, her green gaze so deep and intimate. It made your heart stutter before it started beating wildly in your chest. The way she looked at you…

No one had ever looked at you this way before.

"Tell me you don't want this," she whispered, "Tell me you don't have feelings for me and we forget this happened."

Deciding a leap of faith was your best option, you surged forward and crashed your lips together. She relaxed into you, sinking into your embrace as your arms encircled her waist. Her fingers tangled in your hair, tugging gently. You moaned against her lips and she smiled, your mouths turning into smiles pressed together. 

You couldn't be happier right now.

"I love you," she mumbled, separating your lips so she could bury her face into your neck. She didn't want to see your face as you repl
