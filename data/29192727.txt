Chapter 1





Chapter Text

“Ok kid, just stay out of their way the best you can for a little bit while we get things sorted.” Tony turned to Peter in the lab. He was referring to the Rouge Avengers who were moving back in.

“Yes sir.” Peter saluted with his left and snickered.

“Actually, when you get the chance, you should do that around Cap.” Tony smiled down at the orphan. Peter had just moved into the compound a couple months ago after May had passed away in a car accident. Peter had recently started talking again and Tony was slightly pissed that the rogues were coming now.

“I gotta go make sure that the new folks are settling in I suppose.” Tony wasn’t necessarily worried for Peter’s safety. All of the rogues had individually apologized to Tony, Rhodey, Vision, but not Spiderman (because they didn’t know who he was).

“Mk.” Peter watched Tony leave and looked around the lab, bored. He figured he could run around the track or something. He had been training more with his headphones blasting. He drowned out other sounds so that the only thing he could hear was music.

He took his phone out and started scrolling through different playlists. “Slytherin Common Room” “Play this if I'm in a coma so that I don't have to listen to Ed Sheeran 😗✌️✨🤭😝” “Vibin’ in bisexual” “stressed, depressed, and just failed a test” “dug my keys into the side” “music to play in the car with your parents”(he played that around Tony a lot) “Ribs by Lorde kind of depressed” “Vine energy” “Tik Tok songs”. And so many other choices.

Peter walked down the hall towards the gym, connected his extra long range bluetooth earbuds that he had made himself. 

“Uh, who are you?” A female voice asked and he nearly jumped to the ceiling.

“Christ you scared me.” He glanced at the young woman with round eyes, he recognized her as Scarlet Witch. 

“That doesn’t answer my question.” She says, her voice dark and Peter tilts his head.

“I live here dude.” He puts his earbuds in and plays ‘Tik Tok songs’ because it was the closest playlist to his thumb. He threw up a peace sign before going on his merry way. He didn’t get very far before Wanda grabbed his shoulder.

Peter sighed dramatically and paused his music. He looked at Wanda and raised an eyebrow.

“What? Look, do you need proof?” Peter snapped, “Friday, what’s Tony’s nickname for me?”

“Bambino, sir.” The ceiling chirps. Wanda drew her hand back and Peter resumed his music. He walked away at a quicker pace to the gym. Once he was there he changed to a better playlist ‘Play this if I'm in a coma so that I don't have to listen to Ed Sheeran 😗✌️✨🤭😝’ just because it had a better variety. 

“Stark.” Wanda walked into the living room where everyone was sitting and crossed her arms, “Do you have a child?” Everyone perked up and started at Tony.

“What?” Tony’s face paled, “Why?”

“I ran into a boy in the hall who said he lives here?” She tilted her head. The other Avengers gaped and looked from Wanda to Tony.

“Have you had a kid this whole time?” Steve’s face is a mix between guilt and mortification.

“Look, we can discuss this another time. Ok?” Tony stood up and left the room without another word. He made his way to the gym while all the Avengers started grilling Vision and Rhodey.

“Does Tony have a son?!” Clint shook Rhodey’s shoulder.

“I mean…” He glanced around the room and paused, “It’s really not my place to say.” Clint scoffed and turned to Wanda.

“Did the kid look like Stark?” 

“Kind of. 

Acted 

like him too.” She nodded and Rhodey chuckled.

Tony swung the door to the gym open and sat down on one of the benches. He knew that Peter liked to listen to really loud music because it helped him cope. He understood.

“Oh, hey Tony.” Peter halted in front of him and took out his earbuds. He must have found something interesting on his shoes because Peter didn’t make eye contact with Tony.

“I know you had a little chat with Wanda.” Peter’s face turned red and he looked up from under his lashes. Tony patted the bench next to him and Peter sat down.

“What’d she say?” Peter winced.

“Well, they all think that you’re my son now.” Tony chuckled.

“Oh?” Peter fiddled with the earbuds in his hands.

“Now here’s my question for you. Do you want me to introduce you as my son?” Peter looked up quickly, “You are my son to me in all ways that counts, but it’s your choice.” Peter’s eyes became watery and he bit his lip. He couldn’t form words so he just nodded. Tony pulled the young hero into a hug.

“Thank you.” Peter whispered without breaking away. They sat in silence for a few moments before Peter sat back, wiping his eyes with his palms.

“Ice cream?” Tony asked with a smile and ruffled Peter’s hair.

“Hell yeah!” Peter leapt up and the pair walked down the hall. The kitchen was thankfully empty. Peter grabbed a tub of chocolate and sat down on the counter.

“You’re like a fucking cat.” Tony snickered.

“Hey!” Peter whipped his head around to glare at Tony, “What would your
