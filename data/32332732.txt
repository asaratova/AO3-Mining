Chapter 1: The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet
    




Chapter Text
Peter couldn't remember the last time he had seen sunlight. His cell had a lamp that was supposed to mimic sunlight, but it had burned out a few days ago and no one had mentioned it. He thought about bringing it up to the guards, but with his enhanced senses the bright light was more of a nuisance anyway.So now Peter sat in his dark cell and relied on his cellmates to tell him what day it was.Peter estimated that he had been with HYDRA for about two years. With multiple failed attempts at recreating the super soldier serum, they decided that targeting young mutants would be more efficient. Peter had been going out at night in some old sweatpants to try to stop some local crime. With his new found spider abilities he figured he could do some good for his neighborhood without getting into too much trouble. He told himself if he just stuck to petty crimes and never showed the extent of his abilities he would be fine.He was wrong.HYDRA had seen a YouTube video of him stopping a car from hitting a school bus and immediately targeted him. After discovering his identity through security cameras and facial recognition they made quick work of plotting his kidnapping. They got into his apartment and subdued him with five times the amount of Succinylcholine that any human could survive. They had assumed that his super strength was linked to a super metabolism, just like it was with Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. Luckily May was at work and to the best of his knowledge was still alive.Oh god, May. He hoped that she was alive. He knew that she would be distraught, especially after losing Ben only a year before. But Peter couldn't dwell on her too long. Doing so only made him sad, and any emotion in here was weakness. So he stayed apathetic.He did not talk back. He did not attack the guards. He did not talk to fellow prisoners. He did not have any false hope, or any hope at all for that matter.Peter Parker simply kept existing.---"Widow, status update""Heading towards the West perimeter, be there in two minutes, Cap."Some of the Avengers had been called into Boston to handle a couple of mutants that had decided to go after sensitive information in the MIT labs. Steve, Natasha, and Clint were sent. Only a few were needed to handle the breech, secure the information, and restrain the mutants so that the police could take them into holding. Altogether it was an easy mission that shouldn't take much time."Hey do you think we can find Tony's yearbook while we're here? I could use some good blackmail for the next time he catches me using my bow in the common room.""Do you really think that isn't already online? You can basically track Tony's life through editions of People magazine so theres no shortage of photos. If you want real blackmail buy Rhodey a bottle of whiskey on his next visit.""Good point, Tash.""I am headed into the lab on the upper level. And please, keep chatter to a minimum on the comms its bad enough when Tony does it."Steve could hear someone in the lab. He gripped the door handle and his shield and pushed the door open. Flames immediately rushed at him as he raised his shield to cover his upper torso. He could feel the heat on his legs, but the suit Tony made him protected him from any real harm. Steve dove to the right where he could hide behind one of the lab benches."I have one hostile in the upper lab. Has the ability to shoot flames.""Copy, we have another hostile down here."As Steve listened to Natasha's reply he scanned his surroundings. A red sticker marked where the fire extinguisher was held. He readjusted his shield, stood, and threw it directly at the man. Without looking to see if his shield made contact, he lunged forward and grabbed the extinguisher. As he turned around, the man sent more flames his way; however, Steve was able to get the extinguisher up and pull the clip. The spray was enough for him to get close to the man and bring him to the ground. With his hands behind his back in special cuffs designed to cover both hands entirely, the man was subdued. He kept struggling, but without use of his powers he didn't stand a chance against Steve. Steve simply grabbed his shoulder, turned him around, and started pushing him towards the door."Cap, we are clear on the lower levels. Clint is bringing the hostile down to meet police. Need any backup?""No, hostile is secure. I am coming down now."Steve headed towards the elevator, pushing the man in front of him and keeping a hand clasped on his shoulder. Just as the elevator reached the ground floor his comm beeped twice, signaling that someone besides Clint and Natasha was trying to reach him. Steve reached up and hit his comm twice."Go ahead.""There is a high risk security breech at the tower. Please return immediately.""Shit, FRIDAY do you have eyes on the breech? Which floor?""Level 92 was breeched, all security cameras above that floor have been compromised."Steve rushed towar
