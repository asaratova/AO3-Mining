If SHIELD kept the details of something from an agent, it usually meant the details involved some combination of an unacceptably high body count, actions that even SHIELD thought were immoral, and the result of SHIELD screwing up. Bucky guessed that how he'd got to SHIELD definitely involved the first two, and probably the third as well. But he knew the basics—the Winter Soldier had been in cryostasis when the USSR had broken up, and in the confusion that followed, a lot of Red Room assets had been stolen and sold off, including him. SHIELD had acquired him sometime in the late 90s, then kept him in storage, too wary of the programming they didn't fully understand to risk waking him. What they did know was that there was a fail-safe for him being captured while in cryo—if the Winter Soldier was not woken correctly, the Winter Soldier would kill everyone in the building. Brutal, but simple and effective.There were three people he had to thank for the fact that he was not still in cryo. First was Coulson. Bucky always found the rare occasions Coulson showed his 'Captain America's Number One Fan' side creepy, but it had been Coulson who recognised him and had quietly done his research to prove that the Winter Soldier was almost certainly James Buchanan Barnes, then presented this information to Fury. Information that showed that there might be something—someone—under the programming: someone who had the potential to be very loyal and very useful.The second person he didn't find out about until over a year after coming back. Lakshmi, a meek and quietly-spoken SHIELD archivist who had helped Coulson find information about Bucky, had come across something in a very old text about the Tesseract restoring someone to themselves. Bucky had been introduced to her by Coulson, and couldn't square the shy woman in front of him with the person who had apparently gone directly to Fury with this information and virtually demanded that he try and use the tesseract to restore Bucky's memories. So he asked her why she'd done it."Because you didn't deserve for any of that to happen to you. We couldn't make it right, but we could do better for you than keeping you in a freezer forever."And she was the first person he'd met this century whose sense of justice, whose instinct to stand up for what was right even when they were outgunned reminded him of Steve. He'd hugged her, completely on impulse, and she'd been so surprised she actually squeaked.The third person was Natasha, the person who proved that operatives could reliably change sides, who proved that the programming could be overcome. The woman he'd maybe loved, a long time ago, the woman who was just about the only good thing to happen to him while he was under the control of the Soviets. They'd brought out the good in each other. And that was why they had been separated, why he'd had his memory wiped again, hadn't even recognised her the next time he'd seen her.Three people who were the reason why, in 2008, the Winter Soldier had opened his eyes to find himself in six-point restraints. He found himself looking back into the fiercest one-eyed stare he'd ever received; then he saw a blue glowing cube, heard the words, "Remember who you are." (Much later he wondered if the Tesseract had even been necessary. There was part of him that thought that Fury could probably intimidate his way through any programming the Red Room could put into a person.)The time after that was hazy. He remembered thinking in five or six tracks at once, all the facets of his different recollections of himself running separately. He remembered asking where Steve was, even as other parts of him knew that Captain America was dead. He wasn't sure how long it took him to think coherently. It could have been days. Then, knowing what he'd done, the overwhelming guilt. Disgust at himself. Grief. Despair. There had been times when he could barely move from the weight of the guilt and loss.It was Natasha who helped him out of the blackness. They'd been prevented from meeting for the first couple of weeks, as SHIELD were concerned that either of them might trigger some deep programming in the other. But when she'd found out how bad he was, she'd demanded to see him.He'd been sitting on the floor, shoulder and head leaning against the wall. He'd probably been like that for hours.She had sat down in front of him and said, "Who are you?"The question hadn't made any sense to him. She knew he was the Winter Soldier; so he’d just stared at her.She said, "In all those memories, under all the things you were made to do, there is a person. He was always there, even if he wasn't able to act. Who are you?"And he'd known all along. "Bucky. Bucky Barnes."She'd half-smiled and said, "Pleased to meet you, Bucky."He'd licked his lips, as he found talking difficult after spending weeks silent, "But I still did things—""If there had been a way not to, would you have done them?""No, but—""We both have a lot of red in ou
