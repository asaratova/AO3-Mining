Work Text:
Magnus has lived in New York for decades, has always enjoyed a rather hedonistic, eccentric life style, being high society's go-to guy for that magnificent anti-wrinkle cream or those good luck charms that almost seem to actually work.He is constantly surrounded by wealth and glamour and beauty, sycophants everywhere, everyone wanting to get as close as they can so they can promptly ask for favors.Sound familiar?Yeah, if he and Magnus hadn't known each other ever since he can remember, Tony would have sicked SI's lawyers on him for stealing his bit a long time ago.But they met when Tony himself was just a child, met Magnus at a party his parents were attending somewhere in Asia.Back then, Magnus had smiled at him and talked to him like he would to a grown-up. And Tony had decided then and there that they were going to be friends.Of course, high-society life doesn't quite work like that.They did continue to see each other at various parties from time to time but only rather infrequently, not at all helped by Tony's rather erratic lifestyle as he grew up, from child to teenager to college kid, became an orphan, the owner of a Fortune-500 company, the world's go-to guy for weapons, for technological advancement, turned himself into a superhero, became their country's nuclear deterrent, and forever remained the worldâ€™s punching bag.Not to give the wrong impression, sometimes years go by between the two of them really talking to each other, but the circles of high society aren't expansive enough for the two of them to not at least catch each other's eyes from across the room at least once or twice a year.And, sure, they might have never discussed it, never even brought it up, but Tony has never been blind to the fact that over all the years they've known each other Magnus hasn't aged, still looks the exact same now as he did the first time Tony saw him. A fact that also seems to escape everyone else for some inexplicable reason.It will be years down the line before Tony finally gets an explanation not only for Magnus' forever youthful appearance but also why no one aside from Tony ever seems to notice.And he never actually asks Magnus about it either, doesn't ask him for answers, doesn't ask him for anything. For the very simple reason that Magnus is the one person - the only person - Tony knows who has never asked him for something, not once.Not for money, not for tech, not for favors of any kinds, not even that he better himself. Not anything.And Tony has always made sure to repay the man in kind.There is just something about knowing that whenever they do see each other - even more rarely these days than they used to - Magnus will smile, brightly, honestly, genuinely, and then ask Tony how he has been and listen interestedly to everything Tony might ramble in reply. Without any agenda at all.Magnus who never wags his finger, not about his partying when he was younger, not about his sleeping around, his drinking, his irresponsible lifestyle, his derision for his father, his impatience for anyone not able to keep up with him.Magnus sees him and smiles.It's the only truly genuine smile Tony got to see in high society all throughout his childhood and teenage years, and it's worth more to him than he could possibly say.But.Just because they never discussed it doesn't mean that Tony isn't fully aware that there has to be more to Magnus. That there has to be something he doesn't know to the man, something even beyond just keeping him forever young.So, in contrast to what everyone else might assume about Tony's interaction with Captain America and Norse gods and whoever else, the first person to truly make Tony believe in the supernatural was someone else entirely.Magnus with his never-aging face and his far-too-old eyes. Magnus with his kind smile and genuine interest in everything the desperate-for-attention-but-too-proud-to-admit-it boy at the party might have to say. Magnus who had once even made eight-year-old Tony a nightlight which glowed only to his eyes, invisible to anyone else, so as not to get him in trouble with his 'Man up, Tony!' father.So, yes, Tony has known about the supernatural for a long time, has known that there is more in this world since long before the rest of humanity ever caught on.
But then again, what else is new?
Which is also the source of his derision for all those self-made magicians and superheroes and gods from other planets proclaiming themselves the heralds of magic.Because Tony knows what real magic looks like.And this lot? With the sole exception of Loki, all of their most powerful mumbo-jumbo has nothing on the ease with which he has seen Magnus bend reality, even while just doing a couple of parlor tricks to entertain Tony when he was just a child.Magnus is also where Tony's absolute conviction that magic is just as scientifically definable, just as much governed by scientific laws as anything else in this universe, comes from.Because when Tony had claimed as much -
