Chapter 1: The One Where Loki Sets Himself Free
    


Notes:
So, this one shot is a ‘what if’ scenario based off of Dark Matter, diverging from the main fic around after chapter 16. If you’ve read up to chapter 16, you’re good to go on this one. This is one of those ‘What If’ scenarios I kept mentioning in the comments. This one had to be cut because it causes quite a few plot holes in the main story line, but I liked it enough to keep it around as a separate thing. There are a few identity reveal ideas I had that ultimately didn't fit the main plot.Obviously, this first one has spoilers for the fic up to Chapter 16.

Chapter Text
They leave the school together, strolling into the misty Gotham night side by side, just close enough that it doesn’t look supremely awkward. Peter lets out a quiet breath of relief when they finally leave the school. The conference is done. And no one died, miraculously. Somehow, Loki managed to charm all of his teachers with only a few careful words and managed the whole situation beautifully. Peter didn’t even have to fling himself out of the nearest window and flee into the night, never to be seen again. Minus that one hiccup with Tim and Duke’s brother, the evening passed without incident. Mission success.“You should worry about what you promised him,” Fury says.Okay, yeah, fine, but one crisis at a time, okay?Loki pauses on the sidewalk outside of the school and turns to face Peter, reaching out to grip his shoulder. Peter, pale and shaky from a wicked combination of exhaustion, his growing migraine, and hunger pangs, frowns up at him. This isn’t anywhere close to where they agreed to pull their disappearing act. “Listen, kid,” he sas, pitching his voice just a bit too loud. Peter catches sight of Tim and Dick from the corner of his eye and realizes that Loki wants them to overhear this. Something icy grips his stomach and he’s suddenly worried about whatever Loki’s going to pull. “This isn’t working out.”Peter stares at him. “What?”“This whole ‘us’ thing. You and me, you know,” Loki says, pointing to himself and then Peter. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s been great--you’re a brilliant kid, all your teachers love you--but, uh, I’m not really built for this.”Peter’s headache is getting worse. His temples throb, and his vision begins to go blurry at the edges. He sighs, exhausted. “What are you--”“So I’m cutting you off. You’ve been handling things on your own long enough that you’ve got this all figured out anyway, so it won’t be that much of a change.”“Cutting me off,” Peter repeats slowly. His blood is pounding in his ears; a sign of his worsening migraine. He raises his own voice, just to hear himself over it. “Cutting me off from what? This is the first time you’ve done anything for me since we came to Gotham--”“You were supposed to be getting an allowance. You didn’t get any of that? Huh. There must have been a problem at the bank,” Loki says. He gives Peter an easy grin and gently punches his shoulder. It’s unbelievably awkward, and Peter steps away from him on instinct. “Even better! You’re already fully independent. See, I knew you had this.”Peter stares at him for a long, silent moment that seems to drag on forever before saying, simply, “What.”“Guess you’re not getting it,” Loki says. His tone grows firmer, and just a bit sharper; not quite a yell, but he is projecting his voice. “We’re through. I’m going to go my way, and you go your way.”And then it clicks for Peter. Loki used him. The runes he traced out earlier severed him from whatever prison he was in. He’s free of the Soul Stone, free of being trapped with the others. Peter just set the God of Mischief loose in this universe, free to do whatever he pleases. The gravity of the situation hits him fully then, and Peter pales. “No, no, you can’t--”“I just did,” Loki says from behind Tony’s face, adjusting his cufflinks. “But hey, once you graduate, look me up in New York.” He winks, and his grin grows sharper. “I was serious about that job offer, and I’d love to catch up with you in a few years.”“Son of a bitch,” Sam says quietly. “He played us.”“You can’t just--” Peter steps towards him, and then comes to an abrupt stop. Every nerve in his head flares up as if struck by lightning, and he’s momentarily dazzled by a white hot pain stabbing the back of his eyes like railroad spikes. “Another migraine? Really? You should get that looked at. Maybe eat a little more,” Loki says casually. He checks his watch. “Anyway, I have a flight to catch. Good luck, Peter. It’s been an experience.”Peter realizes that there’s a subtle green to his migraine aura this time. Loki is causing the migraine; he probably started it back at the fire station. Loki turns to leave and Peter growls, marching after him. Another bright flash across his eyes causes him to stumble. Warm arms catch him, steadying him. A quiet voice murmurs near him. Tim's brother, Dick. “It’s okay
