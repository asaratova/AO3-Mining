Chapter 1: Preparation
    




Chapter Text
Peter was in a BIT of a hurry. Swinging open his locker with a force which almost broke it, He started grabbing things and tossing the discarded items into his bag with a speed that looked ALMOST inhuman. To say that peter was a Nerves wreck was an understatement. He was going to wakanda for the summer with his aunt may. The thought of her alone with his girlfriends Family, or HER for that matter, Were enough nightmare fuel To give him a heart attack. And now if he didd't hurry home they were going to be late. As if sensing their friends distress, Peters group of close friends came to see him on the verge of a nerves breakdown.
Harry, Ned, Gwen, And "MJ"stood around him. And if peter Wasn't so in-groused In the terrifying thoughts of aunt may Showing them his baby pictures, Sharing Embarrassing stories, Or asking nakia to teach peter how to braid women's hair, he would have noticed. After Aunt may found peters search history she would not stop talking about HE should ask her to teach him how to braid women's hair. The very Idea of him doing it was enough to send shivers down his spine.
When his group of friends figured out that peter was still in dream land, they all played rock paper scissors to see who got to smack peter back to the real world. Mj,with complete joy, Proceeded to give him a solid smack to his head. Peter coming back to reality with a solid yelp turned to see them all giving him looks.
"Seriously!?" Peter shrieked. "Well what did you expect us to do? Wait till you stopped having an existential crises?" Ned asked with a hint of sarcasm. peter ignoring the comment looked directly at ned. "You don't get it" He started "Im going to be alone in a foreign country with my aunt Spending time with my girlfriend and her family for three months. I am not prepared for this!"
gwen seeing him in distress, put her hand on his shoulder to try to comfort him " peter it's not all THAT bad. At least they know about you this time."she said to ease his stress.
All it did was remind him of the time when T'Challa found him and shuri having a make-out session in her lab. Not his most proudest moment. "Not helping gwen" Harry insisted.
All peter did was sigh and cringe at the memory. "look just go have fun and enjoy your time there with you altogether." Harry advised" I mean whats the worst that could happen?" peters eyes opened wide and looked directly at harry.
It was as if you asked him to revel his identity to the world and give a house tour to all his fans."Im just trying to help."harry raised his hands for mercy.
MJ pulled his hands back down to his sides before he made an ass out of himself. "Look the way i see it is if you just try and relax you'll be finnnnnne" She stated. peter face palmed and tried to keep it together.
He always wanted to be able to go spend time with shuri because she would always had come to him and not the other way around. aunt may, his friends, And nakia were the only ones at the time that knew they where a couple.
And for a time he enjoyed the secretly planed rendezvous in new york, going on nice dates, and just spending time with her. His little wakandan princesses was a gift to him as he saw it.
Being able to find someone he didnt have to make excuses to, being able to connect so easily to and talk to about ANYTHING. He still had yet to tell tony that the upgrades to his suit where shuri's and not his own.
Shuri gave him the upgrades as a gift and after seeing tonys version of the suit made her shiver in disgust. So she took it as an offence when peter said plainly that there where "FINE".
She refused that low tier tech was FINE, Not for her boyfriend, So she made a new suit for him entirely.
one with vibraniam infused, sound proof boots, and an ai slot for karen to integrate into the suit. and after all that she even gave him some web reserve slots for his web shooters after him complaining to her that they kept running out at the worst of times.
The suit was designed after a spider native to wakanda. Black and red with the white spider symbol on the front and back. And as a little fun joke, she put "property of shuri" on the inside of the suit Knowing FULL well that peter would not find it.
And after receiving the gift from her, he engulfed her in kisses that eventually led to the said make-out session in question. Which by shuri's account of events whould have liked to continue if it weren't for her brother who so rudely interrupted.

Ned put a hand on his shoulder and with complete honesty said" At least it's not like the whole liz situation." Everyone in the group had a solid cringe at the mention of her name. Liz was never a bad person But it was unfortunately not the case with her father, who was the vulture. And after their whole fight that lead to a building falling on peter and leaving him with a bit of P.T.S.D, Left liz being moved away Dashing any hopes of the relationship working out for the better.
