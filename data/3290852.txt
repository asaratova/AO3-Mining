Chapter Text
Living across the hall from Captain America and Bucky Barnes was no different than how y'all were living at the tower, before realizing you wanted your own space away from constant chaos and alarms. Being in New York City, you felt much safer with them living across the hall in case of any kind of emergency. There had been a few times where someone random would move in to the other apartment on your shared floor, but the guys would be onto their shit before they could even set their boxes down. Sometimes they even had Natasha over to investigate.You didn’t talk to Bucky much, but anytime the two of you interacted he was very quiet and polite as could be. The poor guy was just so afraid of being triggered or embarrassed, especially since he lived in the tower with Tony for a few weeks when he first came back. One weekend Steve was out of town for a mission, and he put you in charge of watching Bucky and making sure everything went smoothly without him there. Bucky was pretty independent, he didn’t ask for much except for when it came to cooking dinner and using various appliances, as well as how to work the tv. Then the power went out.At first, you didn’t even notice it really. Bucky and you were already mostly sitting in dark since it was 8pm, watching tv. Since it was night time, you were able to look outside and see if any other buildings had lights coming from the windows. It seemed it was a city wide power-out from the rough winter storm raging on, so you plopped back onto the couch with Bucky to your left. The quiet finally set in, and you could hear Bucky’s shuddered breaths beside you. “You okay?” you asked, and he looked more tense than usual. Bucky had only ever freaked out once in front of you, but he immediately left and isolated himself. Here there weren’t many places he could go to isolate. Bucky’s long hair was in his face as he leaned on one of his hands, “I don’t like the complete dark, it reminds me of bad places.” He spoke, and it was the first time you heard his voice above a whisper. A shiver ran down your spine as the apartment started to lose the little heat that it had, and you tried to suppress your chills until it was almost unbearable after a few minutes. There were blankets in the trunk at the end of your bed, so you told him that you’d be right back. But for some reason, he refused to let you go by yourself with all the power out. You held your hand out, hoping he’d take it, (not only as comfort for him, but for you) but he brushed it off and walked in front of you. Bucky didn’t necessarily like touching people, but he almost wanted to hold your hand which was a new feeling for him.As he took strides to his front door, you had to take in how good he looked. Bucky was wearing a dark blue t-shirt that showed off his muscles, in both his human and metal arm. The grey sweatpants are every woman’s weakness, his were baggy, and you could still see his toned calf muscles and butt. He looked back at you, giving you the sign to follow him across the hall. Although you lived in New York for a fair share of time, and were used to people lurking in the alleys as you passed, he still felt the need to protect you crossing the hall.The key to your apartment was in your right pocket, and you hastily pulled it out to unlock the door in front of you. You almost ran inside, retrieved 3 big, fluffy blankets, and then had Bucky grab some as well before heading back to his apartment. Your teeth were chattering against each other slightly, and out of the corner of your eye, you could see Bucky trying to decide what to do when the both of you were back on the couch once more. “You know, uh.” He figured this was the time to make up for not holding your hand, so he scratched the back of his neck and continued, “you can come sit closer to me, I normally give off more body heat than normal people..” Bucky coughed, to try and cover what he felt like his awkward taper at the end of his sentence.He didn’t have to say anymore to convince you, you just shifted on the couch until you were leaning against him with your feet up on the couch, under the various blankets. His arm had already been draped on the top of the couch before you got there, so you were able to snuggle into his chest a little more. Steve had told you that sometimes with Bucky, you had to break a barrier for him to realize that what he was doing was perfectly fine. Little did you know, Bucky had a smile on his face, no one besides Steve had shown him any type of affection like hugging, or even offering a hand out for him to hold.But Bucky wanted to be comfortable as well, so he awkwardly asked, “Can I put my legs up? You can still, uh sit here, though.” He wasn’t sure if he was going too fast with yo
