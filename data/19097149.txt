Peter wanted to be excited about the field trip. He really did. But field trips always seemed to go bad for him. Between Oscorp, Nationals in DC, and the MOMA, well Peter just had the worst luck with field trips. And even though he was a senior, that bad luck didn’t seem to be dissipating.  “And stay with the group.” Peter bit back a groan as Mr. Harrington handed him a permission slip. He gave Peter a pointed look before continuing to pass the papers out. He kept talking, but Peter didn’t listen. He considered just not going at all. May would probably let him stay home, what with his bad luck anyways. Or he could go to Stark Tower for the day.  “So those are the rules for our field trip to Stark Tower.” He blinked and looked up at Mr. Harrington. He then looked at the permission slip. Sure enough, it was for Stark Tower. Peter started at the paper. What even was his life?  Stark Industries had re-purchased the Tower after the second snap to help New York rebuild. Stark Industries was actually vital in the rebuilding and recovery process. People had been singing the praises of Pepper Potts-Stark and the help the CEO had been providing to all those displaced by the snaps. She wasn’t just the CEO of the company; she was the face of rebuilding after such a confusing time. Which allowed Tony the time to heal.  It had been touch and go after the third snap, the one that had ended the battle, but between Shuri, Dr. Strange, Bruce Banner, and a woman named Helen Cho, Tony was able to be saved. He’d lost an arm and had suffered some severe burns on his right side. But between skin grafts, some plastic surgery, and a prostethic arm made by Shuri, Tony recovered.   “Trip’s next week,” Mr. Harrington said as the bell rang. “Return them Monday!” The seniors bustled out of the class, talking loudly about their weekend plans.  “Can you believe this?” Ned asked as he and Peter walked side-by-side out of the classroom. “This is going to be so cool.”   “He’s probably been there before,” MJ pointed out, walking on Peter’s other side. Her hand slid into Peter’s, giving him a small squeeze. He shot his girlfriend a smile.   “Do you even have that internship anymore?” Betty asked, joining the group. “I mean with...everything that happened.” No one liked talking about what happened, but they all seemed to notice how pale Peter got when the Decimation was even mentioned. So they tried to avoid it as best they could.  “Penis didn’t even have an internship in the first place.” Flash cut the group off, keeping them from moving down the hallway. “Clearly you were just doing it to impress Liz. But now, it’s just sad. Better own up to your lies Parker.” Peter rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything. Flash walked away and the group was quiet. MJ gave Peter’s hand another small squeeze but he didn’t smile this time. He just wished for once that Flash would leave him alone. Why could Flash have not been snapped? Betty and Ned exchanged a look, not sure what to do.  “I heard Liz got married,” Ned said, trying to break the tension.   “Weird,” Peter said and Ned nodded. Then they continued on, trying to ignore what had happened with Flash.

Peter sat in the back of the Audi. He sighed and stared at the scenery passing by him.   “You’re weirdly quiet kid.” Peter looked away from the window towards the front where Happy was driving. Since it was the weekend, Peter was going to the lake house to see the Starks. Even though they bought the Tower back, Tony and Pepper preferred to spend weekends at the lake house. And Peter was invited often for the weekend.  “Just thinking.”  “Don’t hurt yourself.” Peter rolled his eyes but a small smile played on his lips. Happy had been nicer to him since returning. It was strange at first but a good strange.   Adapting to being back after the snap had been difficult. The world hadn’t stopped for those who weren’t dusted. They did their best to keep living. Five years had gone by. But for Peter, it had been mere minutes. Yet the world had changed. People had gotten older. Tony had gotten married and had a kid. That had been the weirdest thing to adjust to.   “We’re here kid.” Peter had realized how lost in his thoughts he had been. He got out of the car, small sigh escaping his lips as he stretched.   “Petey!” Morgan came barreling out of the house, Tony following after her. Peter squatted down just as Morgan hurled herself into his arms. Peter chuckled and hugged her tightly.  “Good to see you Mor,” Peter said. He stood up, holding Morgan up with one arm.  “Hey kiddo,” Tony said approaching Peter. He ruffled Peter’s hair and pulled him in for a hug, carefully avoiding squishing Morgan.   “Daddy’s been waiting for you to get here all day,” Morgan said. Peter glanced at Tony who shrugged. Peter smiled and walked into the house still holding Morgan.   “So what’s this I hear about Midtown having a field trip to Stark Industries?” Peter put Morgan down and she disappeared out of the room.  “Did you have
