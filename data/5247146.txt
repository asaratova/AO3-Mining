Chapter Text
Just to be clear: During nonsexual DD/l time, Thor's behavior is more "Daddy" and softer on the power exchange, but he is far more Daddy Dom during sexual DD/l time. I mostly write fluffy DD/l content because it's much easier for me than writing actual porn, w/ the benefit of still being like actual porn to me.D/s – Domination/submission—some people get off on power exchange. Dominant (power-holder, in-control person) / submissive (voluntarily gifts their power to the Dom for the scene). Involves TPE (total power exchange; the Dom has all, the sub has none except their safeword and limits). Daddy Dom/little dynamics typically have a less severe power imbalance, but one you'd expect between caretakers and their charges.Daddy Dom/little (boy/girl; abbreviated as DD/l) – a type of D/s dynamic that is typically gentler and more affectionate than the stereotypical image of the way Dominants and submissives interact (discard your mental image of the “whips-and-chains Dom” coldly degrading and humiliating his sub, although bondage, degradation, and humiliation can all certainly be found in DD/l if both people enjoy it).Daddy (Dom) – a type of Dominant whose “style” typically but not necessarily focuses on caretaking, nurturing, emotional support, guidance, and protection of his little, plus being the dominant participant in DD/l. The Daddy plays "Daddy" (not "father") to his little. The Daddy takes care of his little and may indulge the little, but the Daddy is the authority in the relationship and he also receives service from his sub as a traditional Dom would.Daddy - a person who likes to take on a paternal style of nurturing and guidance. Not necessarily w/ any serious power exchange or protocol rooted in power exchange. Thor in this fic is very much Daddy (nurturing role) outside of the bedroom, and the D/s mostly only activates during sexy time.


Littles and Baby boys/baby girls – they are not the same thing. Baby boys/girls employ age play—age play is playing pretend (role playing) they are a younger age. By contrast, “littles” are adults who express their still-present inner-child self in their relationship w/ their Daddy Dom/Mommy Domme. Both littles and baby boys/girls employ some degree of age play, but for baby boys/girls it is purely role play. [But Thor and Loki still refer to Loki as “babyboy/baby/little/etc” which might be confusing.]Age Play – a form of role playing in which one acts and/or treats another as if they are an age that is different from their years on earth. Age play is not necessarily sexual (like if Daddy!Thor reads Loki a bedtime story, etc). An age player (someone who gets off on scenes involving age play) is not the same as a “little”.Safeword – a pre-negotiated code word used to communicate distress and withdrawal of consent. Useful when “no” and “stop” are authentic aspects of role play.Littlespace (noun) – essentially the mental and emotional state of being when a little is feeling little; the state of mind when a little engages w/ and expresses their little-aspect.Loki is ~27, Thor is ~31.
