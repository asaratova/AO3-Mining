Chapter 1: Darcy Lewis meets The Walking Dead
    




Chapter Text
Â Darcy trudges forward with a huff, a case of water in her arms weighing her down before she comes to a stop and sets it down in the middle of the road. Straightening up, she takes out a pen and a pad of post-its from her jacket pocket, and scribbles out a quick note.
From a friend. -D
She squats, slaps the note atop the case and stands once more. Job done, she turns back around and jogs about twenty yards away to an abandoned car and takes refuge behind it so those walking up the road behind her can't see her. She sits her ass on the heated asphalt, sighing out and glaring in the direction where she knows her back-up and transportation awaits.Currently at the Tower, she is the only friendly face- a face which had yet to harden through the years of the undead eating the living- with just enough experience to go out recruiting. Jane's in Asgard, Natasha's too intimidating, and Pepper's been running on a short fuse the past couple of weeks. And the other females, well they're too civilian for the job. So here Darcy sits under the blazing sun and in the suffocating humidity as she waits for the next batch of survivors to show up.As Darcy waits, she grumbles some and pushes the sleeves of her jacket up to her elbows before ripping off a hair-tie from her wrist. She quickly finger-combs her hair and pulls it over her left shoulder to sloppily braid it, she then sighing and leaning against the car at her back.After what seems like an hour, Darcy finally hears voices. Some sound curious, others sound angry. And not wanting to be seen by peeking her head up, Darcy turns so she's on her knees and lays flat on her stomach to peer beneath the car at the group that she'd been sent to try and recruit.It's a group of fifteen people- a group in which Heimdall sent word that they were honest survivors and that they needed to be led to safety. So as the Avengers gathered and plotted, it was determined that Darcy would meet them face to face. There was the fear that harm could befall Darcy because even though these people were dubbed 'honest survivors', there was no telling to how they'd greet a suspicious newcomer. But seeing a chubby man with a mullet practically dive for one of the water bottles only to have it slapped out of his hand when he attempts a drink spurs Darcy into action without thinking. She sneers at their waste of clean water and pushes to her feet, she only making it six steps out before she's noticed and weapons are trained on her.Darcy's hands immediately fly up in surrender, she rolling her eyes as part of the group advance in a rush. "Hold it right there," she calls out when they're less than five yards away. "I come in peace; I mean you no harm.""Yeah? We'll be the judge of that," a man says. His Colt Python is gripped tight in hand though his aim is towards the road. "Who the hell are you?"But instead of answering, Darcy's attention turns to the archer who's trying to come up on her right. "Seriously, you're close enough," she tells him and he stops in his tracks. "I'm here on friendly terms in hopes you'll hear what I have to say. If you like what you here, you'll have a brand new home within the hour. If not, I walk away and you never see me again." The group doesn't waver with their aim and Darcy sighs. "Jesus Christ, guys!" And then seeing the dark skinned Father, she sheepishly grins. "Sorry, Padre.""Enough," Mr. Colt Python practically hisses. "Name. Now.""Darcy," she immediately replies. "Darcy Lewis.""What's your business with us, Darcy Lewis?""I'm looking for survivors," she says after a beat. Her fingers flex beside her head from where her hands are still up and she shifts her weight from foot to foot. "Survivors who haven't let the world compromise their morals too much to the point where there's no return for them. The good, honest survivors get pointed out to us, and we go an round them up to bring them to a safe-zone.""Safe-zone?" A ginger-haired man perks up, but Mr. Colt Python seems to bristle at her words."Pointed out to you? How the hell are survivors pointed out to you? You spyin' on us?"Darcy gulps when that seems to make others bristle, and she shakes her head. "Not really. It's just- my people-""You are or you ain't," the archer grunts. "Which is it?"Darcy's gaze darts between Mr. Colt Python and the archer, she mentally kicking herself for outing herself early on. "Oh, screw it," she says. Her hands fall to her sides before she slowly lifts them to plant them on her hips, and blurts the truth right at them. "Manhattan's the safe-zone. It's been quarantined off by the Avengers and a few other enhanced superheros that stuck around. I'm the only friendly face around with enough experience on the outside which is why I'm on recruitment duty.""Superheroes?" The ginger-haired man scoffs. "You telling us you bunkin' with a bunch of superheroes and they send you on the dangerous missions of recruitin?""Well, I didn't s
