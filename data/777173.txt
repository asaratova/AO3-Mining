Chapter 1: Cheap Lay, Expensive Whiskey
    




Chapter Text
“He’ll recognize me. But that’s the point, ain’t it?”“Exactly the point.”Bucky dropped the tablet back onto the table and looked at Fury. “I’m supposed to remind him of his dad? Annoy him into playing nice?”“Just a little illustration of there being more things on heaven and earth than Tony Stark has dreamed of.”“And he tells everyone I’m alive?”“Everyone important knows the Winter Soldier works for us. We order Stark not to tell that Bucky Barnes is still alive, and we find out who he talks to when we tell him not to.”Well, yeah, the fact that the Winter Soldier worked for SHIELD was known by just about every intelligence agency and serious bad guy in the world. But the fact that the Winter Soldier was Bucky Barnes wasn’t common knowledge, and frankly, Bucky preferred it that way. It wasn’t important from an intelligence point of view, it was just... hell, he didn’t like people knowing how low he'd sunk compared to who he was before. So he didn’t try very hard to disguise his annoyance at being paraded around like some war souvenir. But he knew why Fury was doing this. He’d screwed up badly on his last mission in Turkmenistan (though there had been a lot of external circumstances screwing him over at the same time), and this was punishment. It probably amused Fury to be able to get two guys pissed in one efficient action.So he was sprawled on Stark’s couch when the guy walked in. Not a bad recovery from seeing Fury unexpectedly in his house, and, huh, more attractive in real life than on TV, and he was pretty hot on TV.Fury introduced himself, but not Bucky. A nice touch, get Stark interested enough to give Bucky a good look. Stark didn’t go for it at first, the guy was smart enough to know when he was being played. But Bucky could see the curiosity and the dawning recognition as Fury explained the Avengers Initiative.“This Exhibit A for your initiative? You cloned Captain America’s sidekick?”“Not a clone. The original.”Bucky grinned at Stark.Stark checked him out, which Bucky was fairly certain was just intended to make him feel uncomfortable. “Looking good for ninety.”Thing was, Bucky didn’t just get in people’s pants for fun, but for work too. He was a damn professional at this shit.  He let his grin spread, checked Stark out thoroughly, top to toe.  A good lingering look at his package, finally ending up with his best ‘fuck me’ eye contact. “I work out.”He could tell that had put Stark off his stride for a moment (no-one ever expected the guy from the forties to swing both ways), but only for a moment. Fury wasn’t reacting to it at all. Hell, Bucky wouldn’t have put it past him that this had been his plan in the first place.“Got Captain America stashed somewhere as well? Wait, no, no point bringing the sidekick if you have the real deal.”Bucky had known that was coming and had prepared himself for it. So he didn’t react at all, even though it scratched the old scars of his grief for what felt like the millionth time.Stark was still talking. “Sorry, Fury, but I’m not a joiner. However many hot pensioners you have on staff.”“Oh, but you have joined, Mr Stark. Whatever you may care to think about it. And everything you have heard tonight, everyone you have seen, is classified top secret.” Fury started to walk to the door, and Bucky stood up to follow him. “We’ll be in touch.”“And I’ll be upgrading my security.” As they got to the door, Stark said, “But hey, Barnes, you ever want to come round for a workout-” Stark grinned at him and Bucky grinned back.Taking up Stark on that offer would be a terrible idea, which was why Bucky was finding it so appealing.In the car Fury said, “I will remind you that any interactions you may have with Tony Stark will require a full report.”“That’s not ‘don’t do it’.”“It doesn’t compromise any current strategies.”“Is it part of any current strategies?”“If we could get to Stark through one of his conquests, we’d have done it already. And don’t give me any wiseass bullshit about them not being you, Barnes.”Bucky smiled. “Sir.”So the next night , having checked Stark’s schedule, Bucky broke into his house again. He only bothered disabling any security measures that might prove fatal. He could stand to announce his presence, he had been invited after all.As soon as he got through side door into the house, Stark’s creepy AI said, “Good evening, Sergeant Barnes. I have alerted Mr. Stark to your presence. He will be with you presently.”Bucky was heading straight to the bar he’d noticed the previous night. “He say anything about not helping myself to his booze?”“No sir.”“Good.” Bucky picked a bottle of whiskey at random and poured himself a generous glass, then dropped onto the couch. The whiskey tasted odd, which either meant it was very expensive or very cheap, and given the surroundings he’d guess the former.Or Stark had poisoned the whole bar. Bucky looked at his glass. He could clear some poisons without much problem,
