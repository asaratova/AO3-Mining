He wonders if he will ever stop being angry, ever stop feeling bone-deep despair.Mostly, he just assaults the weights and the punching bags that Fury provides as he tears through them, resents the faded and quiet things they surround him with and tries not to think. What nobody seems to expect or understand about Steven Rogers, Man Out of Time, is how very, very not comforting surrounding him with the familiar is; the problem is, the most important parts are the ones it's impossible to fabricate.  Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman make him think of Bucky dragging him out night after night in the faith that some dame somewhere would see his best friend and not just a scrawny shrimp, Dinah Shore and Frank Sinatra take him to imagining that first dance with Peggy, the way her head would come to rest on his shoulder and they'd sway back and forth and somehow, magically he wouldn't step on her feet. It goes on and on, Woody Guthrie and Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald, the crackle at the end of the record, the held-breath silence at the end of a disc, feeling like losing them all over again. After the first few days he decides it’s an indulgence he can’t afford himself.[He has always hated the Andrews Sisters - the USO tour had just been the icing on that cake.  It had taken Tony no time at all to figure that one out, and he didn't know where or how the bastard had gotten hold of Star-Spangled Man but he's taken to humming it under his breath when Steve is talking at team meetings. It takes every ounce of control he had not to put him through the briefing room wall by the end.]Stark is right, of course—genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, inventor of miracles, versus broke art student and semi-professional punching bag from Brooklyn. Yeah, that was the hell of it, he’s one-hundred percent right; without Dr. Erskine's genius, Steve was moldering bones in Mount Judah while Tony had superseded human frailty on his own. It doesn't make him any less furious. Later, holding a pack of bloody cards, he suspects the anger was because something deep in him wanted to just walk out into the Sound and see if a genetically altered supersoldier body would have the decency to just drown already if the water was warm enough.  And if he’d thought for a second he had the right to throw away what good men and women had died to protect, he would have. He says “Close the portal” too soon and too curtly, because he can’t stand looking at another time that someone has lain on the wire for him, because all he can see is Bucky picking up the shield and all he can hear is Tony snapping “I’d cut the wire.” He is almost too numb to realize what the hurtling red and gold missile is tumbling back to earth, and even when he does, he does not realize it is an end or a beginning, not yet.  ***After Thor leaves for Asgard, and things start assuming a more mundane shape (not normal, normal is something he gave up on back in 1943) Steve starts looking through the classifieds for an apartment somewhere in the city. He has done just enough reading to be more than slightly sick at how much everything costs and how much red tape lies between him and his sad little back pay account – even with 70 years’ compound interest, a couple years as a very junior Captain and only half of that in combat rather than the dancing monkey gig? Still not that much money in 2012, especially considering twelve thousand calories a day at modern grocery prices - when Tony strolls into his quarters as if he belongs there. That shouldn't have been possible, but he'd seen how easily Stark had had his way with the SHIELD computers and equipment so what was a simple locked door?"Star-Spangled Man making a plan, I see," Tony glances dismissively at the pages spread out in front of him. "You know, almost everybody lists on Craigslist now - or, well, no, you probably don't. Anyway, Craigslist. And the Bronx, really? You may want to rethink that; it's not quite the same as when you left. I mean, not that you aren't fully capable of being a one-man urban renewal but I'd think it'd get old.""Didn’t leave the Bronx, can’t afford Brooklyn Heights since the what-do-you-call-it? gentrification, and I hate to break it to you, but I have in fact been exposed to junkies, thugs and gangs before – the clothes and the slang changes, being poor, proud, angry and out of options doesn’t. But beggars can't be choosers, and it's not like I'm going to stay here," Steve says mildly. "Not after everything.""Wait, what, do my ears deceive me? Good soldier's not going to re-enlist?"Steve looks up at Tony, lips twisting. "The man who made me outta that bottle, said there were more important things than being a good soldier. Last thing he asked before he died was for me to remember that. If I stay here, it's breaking a promise."Tony looks uncomfortable at that, swallows. "Look, I - I didn't mean what I said, before, when we, on the Helicarrier."Steve shrugs. "It's okay, you were right – there
