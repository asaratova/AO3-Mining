Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Phil Coulson considered himself an observant man, but six months spent in South America tracking a HYDRA base could easily fry anyone's nerves. Finally back in his small office on the helicarrier, he'd settled in for the night with a reheated cup of coffee and a stack of junior agent field reports. He didn’t particularly enjoy reading junior agent field reports, but he really liked the quiet that descended upon the Helicarrier at about ten every night, right after the standard complement of graveyard personnel rotated in.  It was Saturday night, and Phil Coulson was doing exactly what he had come to believe he liked doing on a Saturday night.And this Saturday night, Maria Hill is doing exactly what she likes doing, which is poking her head into Phil’s office, at the perfect moment to disrupt whatever it is he is doing, which at this moment, is trying to drink his cup of microwaved coffee."You look cheerful," he says, because she does. Maria Hill's chilliness is legendary around the helicarrier, but Phil has known her for long enough to know that the dismissive calm she radiates is in fact - actual calmness. Maria Hill, believe it or not, wears her emotions on her sleeve, it's just that the spectrum of emotions between preternatural disdain and subtle frustration is the exact spectrum that she chooses to reside in most frequently. Today, Maria Hill is apparently digging into an unanticipated well of feeling to project both excitement and glee in Phil's direction."Are you going to say something, or are you just going to stand there grinning like a cat who's just eaten several canaries?" Phil asks, because Maria is legitimately starting to unnerve him. She steps in, shutting the door behind her, her face alight in a beatific expression that Phil hasn't seen on many people, much less Maria Hill."Phil, will you be my best man?" Maria says."What?" Phil says, because - what? "Or maid of - well, man of honor, whichever you prefer?""Was there a sentence that was supposed to precede all these?" Phil asks, rubbing his temples."Oh, right. Yes. Phil, I'm getting married!"Phil Coulson considered himself an observant man, but that was unexpected. The last time he'd seen Maria, she was joking about entering a nunnery, and either the chastier or floozier definitions would have seemed more likely than this. He takes a large gulp of his coffee, hoping that the gesture would give him enough time to formulate a response.  Perhaps even one that sounded more like "Congratulations!" or "Yay!" instead of "Who the hell are you marrying?" which had apparently escaped his lips unbidded anyway. But, Maria still had another card up her sleeve."Jasper Sitwell."Phil drops his coffee mug in his lap, and he's never felt so grateful to suffer first degree burns. The scramble for paper towels and new pants and aloe vera means that at least for now, the topic is temporarily shelved.---Later when the shock has worn off a little, and after Jasper Sitwell has stopped by Phil's office wearing the same inscrutable grin and asked Phil to be his best man, Phil sits his two best friends down at a bar known for tolerating the shenanigans of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and buys everyone at least three rounds of drinks."How long have you even been dating? You certainly weren't when I left. Wait, were you?" Phil asks, but he’s certain they were not, because if he’s been that dense, he’s going to write Nick Fury his resignation letter and turn in his secret agent card right now."Er, just three months. We figured we'll tell you when you got back, but...we shifted up the timeline a bit." Maria says."It started in Sarajevo." Sitwell says."Sarajevo is surprisingly romantic." Maria adds.The last time Phil'd been in Sarajevo, he'd been a junior agent and the city was under siege. But it has been a couple decades since then, and Maria Hill was the sort of person who might find a souvenir mortar shell with her name engraved on it romantic. Later that night, after a shot of something that Sitwell refused to drink, Maria would point out that she was turning forty, and Jasper was turning forty five, and in their line of work, it seemed unnecessary to dance around each other for a few more years if you already knew what you wanted."We can't agree on who gets you, so we've decided that we can share you as best man and maid of honor." Jasper explains patiently, his hand clasped around Maria's, and jeez, that still looks so weird. "Alright, fine. So, when are we going down to City Hall?" Phil finally gives in. He's happy for them. He is. The glances that Maria and Jasper give each other should have clued him in, but if the glee on Maria's face that accompanied the initial wedding announcement was a wonderful incongruity, it was absolutely nothing compared to Maria Hill painstakingly describing her dream wedding.---Phil Coulson has never planned his dream wedding, except for that one time when he was six, and a dream wedding that consists entirely of m
