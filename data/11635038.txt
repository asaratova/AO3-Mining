Chapter 1: What Is and What Has Yet to Pass (Table of Contents)
    


Summary:

This is a Table of Contents of sorts for anyone that is interested. If you would like to suggest an future chapters from now on they have their own place so they're easier to find.This is just the ideas I have so far.



Notes:
I decided to add a table of contents (and spent an hour figuring out that you can add a chapter at the beginning) so that you could see what's coming up and what all I plan to do. I hope this makes things a little easier all around.I would say 'enjoy' like normal but it doesn't really apply... Lol.I have chosen to not include any of the character catch-ups I have done or will do because those aren't a planned thing and I have no clue where I will end up putting them in relation to the actual chapters.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)

Notes:

So there is a comprehensive list of every single chapter I have written or have planned for this series so far. Feel free to comment below with any additions you would like me to add. This is a list of about 108 chapters and counting.I'm also going to add another chapter in the next week or so (I hope) that sums up the backstories of each character arch so look forward to that to get inserted before the Abilities chapter.
