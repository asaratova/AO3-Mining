Chapter 1: Where we land
    




Chapter Text
WELCOME!This is Omega verse, A/B/O Dynamics. So yep, you know what to expect. This will be co-posted to my Ao3/Wattpad. Depending on where you are reading this, the Ao3 version will be more graphic. (means fuckin...just sayin)The song “Where we land - by Ed Sheeran” inspires this story I do not own avengers/its character or anything like that…if I did, Stony would be cannon. (with more  fuckin...just sayin)  This purely for entertainment purposes so enjoy. In addition, comments are welcomed, hate is not. I do not have a beta, (nor want one) so just try to overlook errors and not be a snot about any you do find. If you do not like these themes then do not read it ^_^  In addition, to those of you who read “Glorious Purpose” this is not in connection with that story. However, I hope you all love this one just as much! Also! there is a few non-cannon elements Phil is alive in this cause… TEAM AGENT! Tony still has the arc reactor cause…yeah I love it. This is set before Ultron (i guess... yall really don't chew on my leg over timeline)  I’m not sure if I will mention it or not, so feel free to think of this as a separate verse altogether if you like.( God bless the multiverse)  There may be some mention of characters from Agents of Shield, I’m still on the fence about it.Beware my sketchy science! As for how my Omegaverse works, its a lot like most in that trope. I subscribe to this physical representation!Female Omega --- Lady parts !Female Beta -----Lady parts ! ( less fertile maybe more diminutive personality)Female Alpha -----Both, Masculine genitalia more prominent, (Think Futanari kinda on this one ladies and gents...did i mention how much i like that? i do..)Male Omega---both, smaller male genitalia,(intersex basically)Male beta - boy parts, not that impressive tho.. again shy follower personalityMale Alpha --- yall know..come on now  Above average disco stick. The rest will be explained in story so yep. Be kind! Feel free to add this work now, first installment will be coming 4/28/16 And now some cover art..made by me.
