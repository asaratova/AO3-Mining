Chapter 1: could it be different
    




Chapter Text
Daily Bugle  @thedailybugleFor legal reasons, we haven't included his face, but a teenage boy was spotted having lunch with Tony Stark a few days before the world was locked down. Is this an illegitimate child? A secret member of the Avengers? A new hire for the Summer Interns Program?  

 Tony Stark @tonystarkofficialI’ve been seeing all the headlines of a secret child, but he’s not. I won’t say much, but he’s my personal intern, nothing more, nothing less. If anybody sends him any hate or tries to find him, even if it’s just a whisper of his name, I won’t hesitate to hunt you all down. Thanks. Virginia Potts @pepperpottsI won’t say much but @tonystarkofficial’s intern is a good kid who doesn’t deserve to be harassed online or in public by anybody so as of now, we’ve made the decision to keep him off social media.
The Intern @tonystarksinternDon’t tell Tony please

The Intern @tonystarksinternTo the thousands of messages I’ve gotten asking me to share things about me, I am incapable of sharing much at the moment. Because I’m @tonystarkofficial’s intern, I can’t talk about a lot. THAT SAID, I’m going to do a Q&A in a minute when I get permission from @pepperpotts

I won’t say much, but my aunt is a nurse who’s on the frontlines of this. Do her and me a favor by staying home

I help mr stark make a lot of their weapons and equipment (also your user is WRONG iron man is strongest)>>> Tony Stark @tonystarkofficialI’m flattered, kid.>>>> Katie @imjustbabieplsokay but what about Spider-Man?? That guy’s literally the nicest person I’ve ever met and he cares about individuals, not just the whole world.>>>>> Tony Stark @tonystarkofficialI agree. Spider-Man’s the best not-avenger>>>>>> The Intern @tonystarksinternYeah, he seems like a cool dude>>>>>>> Katie @imjustbabieplsCool dude?? He’s the best. He cares about everything and that’s what makes him such a good person. My dad’s a cop and he LOVES spiderman. Plus spiderman has saved my dog more times than I can count

> The Only Content That Matters @oliverandmydoglucyFor real tho dude, how is it being Tony’s intern #theinternQA>> The Intern @tonystarksinternFirst, is your account just pictures of your dog??? She’s the best. I already love her. You’re right, it is the only content that matters. Also, it’s not as good as you’d think.>>> MMM @pepperpottsfan03Elaborate???>>>> The Intern @tonystarksinternokay well I’m not just the kind of intern that does coffee (trust me, nobody wants that) but what I do is more hands on. I help with building and tech and stuff. So I’m with mr stark in his lab for a few hours at least twice a week. It’s scary how normal he is. Like just the other day he forgot to eat, spilled his coffee over the blueprints he’d been working on for about 3 weeks, and then decided to take a nap. It was only 10am.>>>>> Tony Stark @tonystarkofficialWow. Okay. I see how it is. You’re just going to out all my secrets like this?>>>>>> The Intern @tonystarksinterndo you want me to? I have plenty>>>>>>>> Tony Stark @tonystarkofficial Please don’t.
