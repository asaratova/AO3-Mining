I personally hate the clone theory, but the Old Spider-Man is too much like Original for me to count it out completely.


 guitaristT65T 360 points 2 hours ago
is it me or does old spiderman have kind of a dad bod



 AugustaRomaine 575 points 2 hours ago
doesn't matter; still hot

  sp8dermenfan 744 points 2 hours ago
More importantly, is there any way Old Spider-Man is related to our new Spider-Man? Father and son maybe?


  LifeFoundationDidEverythingWrong 406 points 2 hours ago
  I get more of an older brother and little brother vibe from them.
  WhOoOoOstolethedonuts 381 points 1 hour ago
  real question is whether either one is related to the parkers
  Triceratomato 492 points 1 hour ago
  I don't know, but you can definitely tell that they all care about each other.
  Maybe it's what Spider-Man always needed - someone else to watch his back.
