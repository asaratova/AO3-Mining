Chapter Text

After Happy drops him off, Peter rushes up to his apartment despite knowing May wouldn’t be home for a while, but that doesn’t slow him. He fumbles with the keys for a moment before stepping inside.

It’s been a hot minute since he’s been the apartment alone; if May knew she was working late, she’d usually send Peter to Tony, and a lot of the time she just ended up joining him at the Tower anyway. Tony was still pretty spooked since it was when Peter was walking to the apartment when he got kidnapped the first time, and insisted the two spent as much time at the Tower as possible despite May’s protests.

Their apartment was pretty good for New York standards, and it was probably the most well-protected place in all of Queens thanks to his dad’s overprotective nature (“Tony, we don’t need you to install FRIDAY.” “But May—” “No, Tony!”). It held all of the Parker’s knicknacks over the years, but there is the unmistakable yet subtle addition of things that scream Stark.

They ranged from the new lighting fixtures that were able to dim when Peter was overwhelmed to the new color on the walls that Tony helped them paint; now 

that

 was a fun time. Little things that have been added in over the months. Lord knows Tony would have wanted to add a whole lot more but May Parker was never one to accept extravagant gifts, even if they were from one of the richest people in the world.

Not only that, but new photos were added all around. Next to a picture of May and Ben holding a squirming 8-year-old Peter was one of the rejected photos of Peter and Tony holding the Stark Industries certificate (there were many rejected photos that day, and this one was of Peter doing the splits in mid-air behind Tony who was doing the Super-man pose while somehow managing to still display the certificate). The most recent addition was a photo of May and Pepper smiling at the camera, taken during one of their weekly get-togethers outside of the Tower. 

Peter’s favorite of the new photos was truly a masterpiece captured by May: Tony was in the ugly dad sweater Peter gave him, Peter laughing at the monstrosity with tears in his eyes, Pepper giggling as she tried to take a photo of them with her phone as blackmail, Happy in the distant background looking grumpy as usual, and May’s face smushed in the corner of the frame, sending the viewer a peace sign.

Looking at it now brings a smile to his face, making him momentarily forget the worry he had for May’s well-being. 

...Well, now he reminded himself about it, great.

“Ugh.” Peter groans, flopping face-first into the sheets of his bed (a hand-me-down from Pepper, because the fabric didn’t grate on his skin when it was overly-sensitive). “This sucks.”

Peter almost forgets, but he remembers to text Tony to tell him he’s arrived home.
 
Sticky Dude:

Metal Man:
 thank god you actually remembered to text me this time

Sticky Dude:

Metal Man:
 No, but FRIDAY would’ve informed me if something happened

Metal Man:
 Don’t fret, young grasshopper, and instead go do your homework

Sticky Dude:

Metal Man:

Sticky Dude:

Metal Man:

Sticky Dude:

Sticky Dude:

Metal Man:
 I wouldn’t ban you, kid, you’d just end up causing explosions where I can’t supervise you

Sticky Dude:
 ...true
 
The short texting session with Tony was enough to get rid of the edge of Peter’s anxiousness. It was nice to know that there was someone else looking out for May too. For far too long, it was just May and Peter, and they were all the other had. If May was in trouble, and Peter was busy, or vice versa, it would quickly become a disastrous situation. Before getting close to Tony, their emergency contacts used to be each other and some of May’s co-workers who had their own lives, and couldn't drop everything they were doing to help.

But now, they both had a small army worth of people who cared for them, and would drive (or fly) as quickly as they could if they ever got a distress call.

Even the Rogues were all kind, and even though they didn’t know May nearly as well as they knew Peter, he knew that every single one of them would help out if asked. Even Steve, who Peter had recently found out tried to kill his dad, but the past is the past (sort of, he’s still working on it).

“Homework, got it.” Peter mutters, taking out his books. “I can do that.”



Turns out he couldn’t. It kept going back to May, and if she was alright. Peter was just about to go ‘fuck it’ and put on the suit and swing to see her when the doorknob jingled.

“Peter? I’m back-oh!” M
