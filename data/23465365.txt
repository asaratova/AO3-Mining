Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“So. What’s up with this Spiderguy anyway?” Nat flops down next to Tony, flinging her legs onto the paperwork he’s got arranged in his lap and throwing him a cheeky smile when he gives her a Look.Tony gives in first, rolling his eyes and leaning back, he pulls off his glasses and cleans them. “What do you mean, Romanoff?”Nat grins, shrugging and settling in further, “Well I mean, we basically know nothing about the guy.” A quick flick of the wrist indicating the rest of the Team sprawling around the common room they’ve all been settled in for most of the morning. Natasha turns back to Tony and tips her head, “You know more about him than anyone here, right? You did bring him with you to Germany, after all.”Tony winces at the reminder of the dramatic fight they were all sort of still getting over. It has been a tough few months but, thankfully, in the end everyone managed to act like adults, and they had worked out their issues without any lasting repercussions, politically…  Personally, though, there has still been a bit of stuff to work through.Pressing his fingertips against the bridge of his nose, rubbing softly, stalling. “Actually… No… I know he’s a good guy, but outside of the things I’ve found on YouTube, he plays everything pretty close to the vest… I do know someone who knows more about the Spiderling…”Tony raises his eyes to the Team, thinking hard… A few minutes later he wilts slightly into the couch, letting his head fall back in defeat. “And I guess it’s time I introduced you to him anyway…” He says with a shrug. Raising his voice, he sounds more like his usual self as he calls, “FRIDAY? Is Pete here?”The warm Irish burr answers, “Yes Boss, Peter is currently pacing in the lower labs, working on schematics for a Spider-Cycle. Would you like me to ask him to join you?”Steve breaks in before Tony has a chance to answer. “Wait, wait, wait… Are you telling me, that YOU, Tony Stark, don’t know who Spider-Man is? But you brought him to a fight?”Tony groans and facepalms, the response coming out a little muffled. “Don’t worry Steve. I promise you this guy is ok.” He waves off Cap’s concern. “It’ll be fine.”Addressing F.R.I.D.A.Y. again, Tony flops his hand towards the ceiling, “Fri, can you get the Kid up here.”Steve, Clint, and Nat stare wide-eyed at their Teammate, startled that he would trust someone he doesn’t know absolutely everything about. Sam seems slightly less affected, though he seems to realize something is off about the situation.Clint breaks the uncomfortable silence, frowning as he turns to Nat and Tony, he whispers. “…Why would Spider-Man need a motorcycle?” 
 Tony had floated the idea past Pete two days prior and was still chuckling to himself at the intern's reaction. “…You want to introduce me to the AVENGERS?!” At the end, it comes out as a horrible squeak, and Peter’s face reddens as Tony laughs, not unkindly. Peter squints a little, suddenly suspicious, “Why?”“Kid! You are brilliant, and they will love you,” Tony shrugs guilelessly, “Why not, you’re here all the time anyway.”Peter huffs and glances back down at his workstation in Tony’s (and let’s face it, he might as well admit it is his, too) lab. Tony is right, he has been here more often, lately, than at home. Fiddling a little, he nervously adjusts some of the tools and components he’s been working with before looking back up at Tony. Thoughts flying through his head, he shrugs, completely serious he meets Tony’s eye. “You’re sure you want to do this?”Tony looks concerned for a beat, before Peter’s face splits into a teasing grin. “I could tell them so many stories about you,” he teases, wiggling his eyebrow mockingly.Tony cackles, slapping a hand on the table next to him, jostling his own work. “Ooh, they are going to Love you, Kid.” 
 Now, the genius had a bet with himself as to how red he could make the kid blush in front of the Avengers. “This Kid creates all of Spider-Man's gear, did I tell you that? I couldn’t believe it when the Web-head told me his little friend had his tech needs covered! ME!” Tony blusters, laughing internally as he raves about Peter, giggling in his head as the Kid’s face grows flushed and he stammers in embarrassment.Tony takes pity, before he upsets Peter too much, slinging an arm over his shoulder, pulling him forward and hugging him to his side. “So of course, I had to meet him, and finally Spider-Man agreed to let me have the Kid's name…” Tony squeezes Peter gently, grounding him. “But I was still floored when we actually did meet. I expected someone a little older than 18! You were such a baby!” Tony teases patting the young man's cheek and grinning from ear to ear.Tony had caught Peter when he stepped out of the elevator, having called him up with no explanation. In hindsight, probably not one of his smarter moves, but Tony dismisses his regret at not forewarning Peter as he continues embarrassing the kid.  They've moved to the kitchen, and to Peter's regret, Ton
