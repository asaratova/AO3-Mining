 There was an unconscious, half-dead god of lies in the medical wing of Avengers tower. There was a very dead Mad Titan quite literally in bits being squeegeed off the north side of the tower, and carefully removed by S.H.I.E.L.D. extraterrestrial specialists preventing as much of it as possible from getting into the sewer or anywhere else some alien bacterium and such, which may or may not be harmful (but they knew from experience to bet on it being so) to humans, from meeting with any unprepared humans or the bellies of local urban wildlife. The Avengers were alive, and all whole. Even Clint hadn’t broken any bones this time and required only seven stitches on his left arm. Natasha had one knee badly twisted, and also was in a cot in the medical wing, an Aesir-strength projectile weapon within arm’s reach to point at Loki if the broken god managed to wake up and so much as look at her funny. More to the point: the Avengers were alive, and not permanently harmed––as was the city of New York in general with only more property damage that would take a couple months to repair, and no civilian casualties––solely because of Loki being a clever bastard.~~ In the wake of the epic fireworks (or, rather, fire-and-ice-works) display that took place mostly in the skies over half of New York City before the two main players crash-landed in Central Park (as Thanos’ fleet of ships drifted away from the earth with all their systems on the fritz and an unstoppable self-destruct sequence creeping inexorably toward completion) the players in question proceeded to weave a tangled pair of cat-and-mouse trails through the city, while Thanos’ incredibly loud voice (JARVIS confirmed it could be heard clearly by the average human ear for a half-mile radius around the Mad Titan as he charged) began shouting the most fascinating and sincerely pissed off accusations at Loki for most of Downtown to hear, including the Avengers trying to keep up with them both, Tony Stark found himself the first to approach Thor where he knelt at the edge of the crater Loki was in, right at the front of the building the god of mischief had opened a portal for the Chitauri above just a year and a half before. Overhead, new fireworks started: Thanos’ fleet self-destructing all at once. The two Avengers spared it little more than a glance before returning their attention to the surprisingly large area coated in blood-and-meat-and-melting-frost on the side of Avengers Tower, and then down further to the trickster responsible for it. The mortal inventor, still in his armor, battered but only a little scathed, made a thoughtful noise. Thor looked up at him with eyes full of confusion and pain. His fingertips rested near Loki, but not quite touching him, as though he wasn’t certain he quite dared; whether because he thought it might hurt himself or because it might sting Loki, seemed uncertain. Possibly it was both, if Tony had to hazard a guess. The inventor cleared his throat. “Leaving aside how Thanos showed up here somehow convinced your brother was acting as Earth’s savior, and disobeying direct orders by not taking his portal somewhere practical like the North Pole to amass his forces before attacking, and instead bottle-necking them until we could send a nuke...” Tony began, aiming his query at Thor, “there’s one really pressing question on my mind I can’t resist asking first.” “What is it?” asked the Thunderer. “Why is he blue, what the fuck is that box currently stuck to his hands with frost, and does your brother have a lethal allergy to being straight-forward and direct about his plans?” “He’s adopted, to the first; that’s the Casket of Ancient Winters we thought had been lost when he fell into the void for the second; and finally a resounding yes to your third question.” He raised his eyebrows. “Rather than the one you initially suggested.” “Well, the blue was foremost, the rest just sort of slipped out without my permission. It’s been a long fucking week,” Tony groaned. “He must be so pissed off at you and your dad. Seriously, he didn’t even want to pretend to be on our side to fuck these guys over, but then pulls this shit? He couldn’t have sent Barton with an encrypted note and left him deliberately on the helicarrier before he fucked off with the tesseract or something? For fuck’s sake!” Thor looked thoroughly aggrieved. “My father broke his trust, and some far deeper qualities. I am a painful reminder of all that he feels he has lost, and one who possesses still many of the things that he can no longer have.” He shook his head. “You also heard as well as I did, that he was being monitored by that scepter of his, to make certain his behavior remained loyal-seeming enough.” Tony took a deep breath as he heard the city coming to life, shouts of rescue crews and the just-now-audible drone of the approaching helicarrier not-so-distant. “We’ll bring him inside. Might want to hurry, before anyone gets any ideas or recognizes his armor. Wh
