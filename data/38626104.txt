Work Text:
Storm tenses the first time the lightning strikes, leaving Dr Rafaela Panacea outlined with the golden light, the taste of electricity in the air. Fear has always made her so sure she’ll kill anyone she loves with her moods, with her weather powers. Rafaela moves closer, the buzz of electricity makes Storm gasp and she sighs at the feeling of Rafaela’s lips against her own. “Give me all of it Storm, I can take it…”The words are soft and Storm shivers, curling into Rafaela even as the storm crashes around them, the crackle of electricity becoming a backdrop to their passions, Rafaela not once releasing her, even when the lightning washes through and over them both.
