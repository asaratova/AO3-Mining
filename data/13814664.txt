Peter heard the last school bell ring, and all the students, including him and Ned, eagerly lifted their belongings into their hands. Their teacher, Mr. Herium (a lot of kids called him Mr. Helium), shouted over the commotion of the now free teenagers,“Before you kids go,” Peter felt himself groan along with his peers, so close to freedom, “we will be taking a field trip to Stark Industries! Please take a permission slip at the door, and get it signed by tomorrow.”Ned turned to Peter with a bit of laughter in his eyes and spoke,“They are so going to embarrass you dude.” Peter knew. He did not take joy in that fact like a certain Ned Leeds. When Peter moved into Avengers Tower, him and the rest of the team decided to not announce this. Tony had wanted to, but Peter had practically begged the billionaire not to on account of the fact that Flash would call him a liar. Then he spent the next hour explained to the whole team that, “no, they could not go ‘talk’ to Flash.” And that it is, “probably not very legal to threaten and possibly murder a teenager, I’m looking at you Nat.”“Maybe I can somehow hid the permission slip from them.” He wondered aloud.Ned huffed out a laugh mixed with a snort, “Fat chance. Try to hide something, anything, from two super-spies, two super-soldiers, and two geniuses who, together, can hack any brain, human or mechanical.” Ned made a good point, but Peter still had to try. As he grabbed the permission slip, he shoved it under everything in his backpack.When the duo shuffled out of the school, a certain Flash Thompson caught Peter’s eye. He sighed quietly to alert Ned to the thinks-he’s-intimidating bully.“Hey, Penis!” Flash waltzed up to them, his eyes held a certain smugness to them. “Think you can get your friend Tony Stark to show up at the field trip tomorrow? Oh wait, you were lying about the internship.”Peter said nothing and instead opted to walk away with his head low. Yeah, it was humiliating, but he couldn’t exactly punch Flash with his super strength. Ned followed, he was staying over with Peter for dinner. Steve was making spaghetti.They threw their backpacks against the entrance wall when they arrived to the main floor, where Peter’s room was. Being the youngest of the group, Peter’s room was in the middle of everything. Tony Stark's, rarely used, bedroom was only a couple feet away from Peter’s. Eventually, after many days of begging, all the Avengers had rooms around Peter’s.“We have hooks. I assure you, they’re not decoration.” Tony grumbled from the living room without taking his eyes off the tablet in front of him. “Hi Ned.”“Sorry!” Peter called out loudly as Ned waved. Peter practically dragged Ned towards his room. They entered Peter’s room to set up their new Lego Death Star. Peter’s room was strange to get used to at first. A lot of the furniture was located on the ceiling; his bed, a desk, even his dresser was stuck to the ceiling. His bed was adorned with a comforter made of permanent webbing Peter had created in the lab. There was even a little nook in the corner of the ceiling for Peter to do his homework. Of course, there was furniture on the floor for when Ned slept over. Usually, when Ned did spend the night, he took the floor and Peter took the ceiling.After they had finished their Death Star, Steve opened the door,“Dinner time.” He called to get the boys attention. Peter looked over and grinned at Ned. Steve Rogers pasta was legendary. They eagerly followed Steve into the kitchen where plates and silverware were already set on the table.Ned and Peter took their places at the table, squished in between Tony and Bruce. Natasha sat across the table from Peter, and Steve would sit across from Ned. Next to Steve’s chair sat Bucky, who was permanently tense. Of course, Clint was perched on top of the back of the chair next to Natasha.Steve placed the pot of spaghetti in the middle of the table and sat down in his designated spot. Peter was the first to take the spoon and scoop a big helping onto his plate.When everyone’s plates were full of spaghetti, Natasha turned to look at Peter,“What time’s the field trip Pete?” She raised the permission slip that was snuggled between her fingers. Steve’s eyes brightened and he looked towards Peter with curiosity.“Oh? Where’s this field trip Peter?”“Try not to gain any more radioactive superpowers this time.” Bruce said dryly. Peter shot Ned a look when he stifled a laugh.“Actually, the field trip is going to be at Stark Industries.” Natasha lifted her eyebrow. “Imagine that.”Tony grinned from ear to ear. Before the genius could say anything, Peter interrupted.“Please, don't embarrass me.” He groaned in dismay.“Why would I ever do that. I don’t embarrass people, I enlighten them with my very presence.”Peter slammed his head on the table.“I think it’ll be fun, kid. Now that,” Clint paused to grimace and squint his eyes, “ Flash  moron can’t say you’re lying.”Tony plucked the note out of Natasha’s hand and signs
