Chapter 1





Chapter Text
The Asset strode towards his quarters - barely more than a concrete box with a mat for a bed - after a long day of reacclimating to the thawed out world. He had been out of cryo for a couple of days, long enough for his handlers to assess that their greatest weapon’s reflexes and programming were unaffected by his time in the ice.He wasn’t sure how long it had been and he had no reason to ask. It was irrelevant to his mission, whatever it was that they had seen fit to wake him for.A couple of doctors - both betas from the way they held themselves, one male and one female - wearing white coats and stethoscopes around their necks were wheeling a trolley of standard medical equipment in the opposite direction. Thermometer, blood pressure machine, and blood sugar monitor were the most obvious, perhaps routine tests on one of Hydra’s many experiments.Something in his solar plexus contracted at the thought of those experiments.He wasn’t sure why.Adding that to his list of irrelevancies, he contained the rogue physical reaction and continued down the corridor.The two doctors were talking animatedly, taking only enough notice of The Winter Soldier as they had to in order to stay out of his way once they caught his scent.That was to be expected.When their scents hit him, his vibranium hand reached out of its own accord, clamped around the male beta’s neck, and lifted him off his feet.That was not.The doctor looked at him in terror, choking and kicking in place as The Asset observed him carefully.The beta's scent mixed with another.An omega's; rich, ripe, and maddening with hints of sugar, fresh-cut grass, and...him.It took The Asset mere seconds to ascertain that the scent clung to clothes rather than skin, a hallmark of periods in close proximity rather than cloying, intimate contact.For some reason that he couldn’t pinpoint, the realisation caused his grip to loosen just a little.The next thing that he was conscious of was the guards surrounding them, rifles trained on him from as safe a distance as was possible in the long, narrow space. Forcing the unfamiliar sensation of what he could only define as a “feeling” back down into the depths of his body, he released the wheezing beta back onto his feet. The doctor didn't have the opportunity to realise that he was free before his skittish associate pulled both him and the trolley away.The guards remained in position for a while longer, some shaking visibly as they tried to anticipate any coming assault.The Asset pulled his outstretched hand back and scrutinised the movements of his flexing fingers which, now appeared to be behaving as they should. Still, such a public incident would end in either a trip to the technicians or his handlers.He reasoned that the former was preferable.The nearest guard jumped, gripping his rifle tighter as The Asset looked up and addressed him.‘Technicians.’ The man nodded up the corridor, the whole unit backing up against the wall to let him through as he immediately headed in the indicated direction.The scent got stronger the closer he came to a junction of identical windowless hallways. It filled his nose, the now bolder, sugary scent making him want to attribute to it the alien words of cotton candy and angel hair. He could practically see it wisp and roll down the hallway to his right as it infiltrated the oxygen particles that the ventilation systems pumped into the extensive underground bunker.That “feeling” rose back up to the surface as he halted in the centre of the colliding corridors. It was difficult, near impossible even to hold back from throwing himself full-tilt into it and tearing off every door in his way until he found its source.That puzzled him.Nothing puzzled The Asset.It wasn’t as though this was the only omega scent in the near vicinity. Even a ghost of an alpha, trained and medicated to suppress every biological instinct could scent an omega a mile away yet, this was...different. This was like facing off an enemy intent not on victory but possession and The Asset was lost for any concept that could explain the urge to fall to it rather than fight it. He may have considered that his necessary suppressants were wearing off or insufficient, however, since he had been given the last of the battery of shots with the express purpose of subverting his body’s rutting instincts only hours before, it made no logical or biological sense.The Asset may have had no inclination of what a rut felt like but he somehow knew in his bones that this wasn’t it. This was something that urged his caution as much as his action, something that demanded an attention other than destruction, something that he didn’t have a word for but perhaps may find upon further investigation.He would follow it, The Asset decided.He would follow the fresh-cut grass, the angel hair, and the incomprehensible imprint of himself and the promise once made was the only thing to convince his feet to travel in any conflicting direction
