Tony knew he was in love with James Rhodes the moment they met. James was the first person who looked at him and saw Tony, not Tony Stark, not Howard's son, just Tony.College was the best time of his life. That's why he made sure that he stayed all four years. He could have finished in one but he wanted as much time with James as he could. Soon James became Rhodey or Honey Bear depending on his mood. They dated and Tony was happy. Rodey never treated him like a means to academic success or societal advancement. He treated Tony like someone normal and that was the best part.They went on dates, studied together, and just hung out together and Tony loved every second of it. Rhodey was there for him when his parents died and Tony was sure that whatever came their way wouldn't matter because he and his Honey Bear were too strong together.They kept their relationship secret from everyone except Rhodey’s mom because that woman had taken one look at them and said, “I'm old not blind boys.”Rhodey posed as his best friend because the military is stupid. Tony made sure that they would work together a lot.It was crazy but it was them.Their relationship came out shortly after Afganistan and Rhodey's man on a mission mentality.Neither man cared, they were out proud and if anyone messed with them they would get a kick to the ass by a Colonel or a superhero.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXWith Bruce Tony didn't realize he was in love at first. After all they were in the middle of an alien invasion. Fighting aliens proves to be an excellent distraction from all emotional stuff.Then when Bruce moved into his tower and Tony spenr calm days talking to him, listening to him, and sometimes just sitting together while they worked Tony realized that he was falling in love.He would like to say that he handled the revelation in a calm and mature way.He didn't. He locked himself in his room and had a panic attack about how Rhodey was going to be disgusted by him and never want to see him again. JARVIS apparently decided that this master was an idiot and called James, who came over as fast as he could and talked him down with sweet words, soft kisses and offer to take him and Bruce on a date and see where things went.That's when Tony relaized that Rhodey’s calmness and compassion were two more reasons he loves the man.The date was actually pretty good. Tony watched Rhodey flirt with Bruce. He could definitely see something between the two.What surprised him was when Bruce cleared his throat and said, “I don't do one night stands and I will not hurt the other by being with one of you. So, I think I should leave.”“And what if we don't want a one night stand? What if we want you in our bed forever?” Tony had said and watched the delicious blush that he loves crawl across Bruce's face.“We? As in both?” Bruce asks softly.“We as in both,” Rhodey says and Tony looks at him to see if Rhodey is doing this just for him but he sees Rhodey watching Bruce with respect and love.So, that's Tony got a Brucie Bear along with his Honey Bear.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXDr. Stephen Strange didn't think he was going to like Dr. Stark. According to all the people he talked to they said that the two of them were very similar. Which meant that Stephen was definitely not going to like stark.He was very very wrong.“Hey Glinda. Welcome to Avengers Compound,” Stark says.“Glinda?”“Well yeah. What else was I gonna call you? Real names are so boring,” Tony says and Stephen's twitch into a small smile.“And yet I have nothing to call you,” Stephen says.“How about Tony. It's technically a nickname,” he says and the cloak slips off Stephen's shoulders in order to circle Tony curiously.“Ummm...hi. I'm Tony,” Tony says holding out his hand. The cloak wraps around it but in the approximation of a handshake.“This is the Cloak of Levitation.”“Oh cool. What are your pronouns?” Tony asks and Stephen is full on smiling now as the cloak shakes it's head when Tony says he and she but nods when he says they.“They and them? Sure thing. Can I call you Levi?” Tony asks and Stephen watches the cloak wraps around Tony in a hug.“I like you too Levi,” Tony says patting the cloak and then narrows his eyes when he hears Stephen laughing.“What's so funny?” “I've never seen someone meet a centuries old sentient magical artifact, ask it it's pronouns, then proceed to give a nickname,” Stephen says.“What can I say? I'm special like that,” Tony says as the cloak settles on his shoulders.“Yes, you certainly are. Would you like to go to dinner with me?” Stephen asks recognizing the look the cloak...Levi...is giving him. It's the, if you let this man get away I will float you up and drop you, look.“I... I'd like to, if my boyfriends can come too,” Tony says and Stephen raises an eyebrow.“Boyfriends? As in more than one?”“What can I say? We break all the norms,” Tony says and Stephen smiles.“I bet you do,” he says and goes to dinner with Tony and his boyfriends. They seem to click exceedingly we
