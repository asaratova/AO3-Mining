 Chapter 1

*********************************
  Thor knew that he would always remember the moment that his brother died. The entire world went silent and moved at torturously half speed as he watched it play out before him. Helpless to prevent it from happening, yet forced to watch it all unfold.  The plan had been simple. Their adversary, not so much. Whatever mastermind that was behind this latest attack, had been slowly upping his game. As though testing their strengths and weaknesses. Loki had lead the charge at Thor’s urging, he’d never forgive himself for that. Grimacing as he dashed past the pittance of robotic troops with his daggers blazing. Daggers that glowed lethally green with the limited amount of magic that Odin had allowed him.  He sliced through limbs with his rapid speed and Thor followed behind, mowing down those that still stood with his mighty Mjolnir. Both never paying heed to the barrage of gunfire that nipped at their footsteps. They were gods and while not bullet proof, tended to be quite difficult to hit when they wanted to. Thor had made it through to the other side and was backing away as a second wave of robots came pouring out of the surrounding buildings to join the first. Tossing his mighty war hammer from hand to hand as he eagerly awaited to confront them. His back impacted something and he turned to see that Loki had stopped, staring intently at the building wall before him.  The shadows cloaking the building’s wall seemed to come alive, glowing a deep red at sharp angles before the giant scorpion like machine fully revealed itself.  “Any ideas,” Loki had asked curiously.  “Kill it,” Thor had responded with his battle ready, eager smile.  Loki rolled his eyes, as though he didn’t know why he’d expected anything different.They had just enough time to register the claw like guns it wielded before it was firing upon them. Splitting them up as they dove in opposite directions. The robot army swarmed in, focusing their attack on the larger Asgardian. Thinking back, Thor knew it was just to keep him busy.  “You need any help there, big guy,” Tony was chiming in over his earpiece.  “For this?” Thor had scoffed as he swung his mighty weapon and batted down robots as though they were mere toys. “Surely you jest.”  “Well, I was just asking as it seems as though little brother may have bitten off more than he can chew,” Tony stated.  Thor glanced over his shoulder as saw that the giant scorpion had fully descended off the wall and was firing steadily upon Loki, dogging his footsteps as he ran in a wide circle, his long legs and swift stride keeping him just clear of the fire from the great beast. Though his speed and agility were greater than that of a mere mortal, he was still unable to attack and not get hit himself.  “Nonsense, he is doing fine,” he stated, then noticed the robot’s massive tail was held aloft and was glowing a brilliant blue, the whine of it charging up hinting at some massive weapon could be heard even over the gunfire.  Thor bashed his hammer down, knocking back the latest wave of bot soldiers, but could already see more approaching in their wake. He was torn, he wanted to aid his brother, knowing his daggers could not possibly be as lethal against such a foe as that. However, if he moved, then they’d have both the soldiers and the scorpion robot to deal with at the same time. He knew this attack was meant to split them up, but perhaps the mastermind behind this didn’t realize that he was dealing with gods.  Thor brought his hammer down again, a great wave of lightning and earth rolling before it as it laid to waste the robot forces. Thor heard the giant weapon blast and felt the earth beneath him lurch as he was suddenly moved. The green tendrils of magic yanking him just out of reach of the blast, though it was still close enough to feel the laser’s heat upon his arm. He turned to see Loki pulling back his magic as he turned his focus again with a grimace back to the bot. Loki saving him from harm was nothing entirely new, though he couldn’t help but feel a surge of fondness for his brother over such acts. Proof that no matter what his brother said, he did not wish harm to come to him. If only Thor had been able to return the favor.  Already the scorpion bot’s tail was recharging. The claw guns began firing again and this time instead of running away, Loki dashed straight towards the massive creature. Driving a path straight down the center between the two lines of bullets until he was close enough.  His arm drew back, fingers charging the blade just before he threw it. His aim as sure and true as ever as it lodged right in the center of what could be seen as the robot’s face. Causing it to draw in it’s claws in self defence, and ceasing the gun fire. Loki continued forward, his feet carrying him closer, until he launched him
