It's time.


For sure?


Yes.


How long?


Three days till end game.


I'll arrange everything.


Thank you.


Good luck.


Please be careful.

“Goodbye John.”


“No!” John shouts as he sits up in bed. He takes a deep breath. Christ. Every time. Every time he goes to sleep he sees it again. It's only been two weeks, but he has never been so sick of something in his entire life. Not even his damn psychosomatic limp.


He gets up and goes into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. Out of habit he grabs two mugs and has to put the other one back. A sob works itself up his throat.


“Fucking Moriarty,” John mutters as he waits.


He closes his eyes and sighs. He's going crazy. He really is. There is nothing to occupy his mind. It just keeps getting trapped in the same line of thought, the same nightmare that has been his life lately. Something else he hates.


He turns on the telly out of habit when he sits down in his chair. He flips through the channels, trying to find some crap telly that 

won't

 depress him. The news shows a segment of some crazy battle in America involving 

actual aliens.

 He huffs a sigh and keeps flipping. Americans.


Eventually he settles on reruns of Doctor Who. Somewhere between the TRADIS taking off again and saving another world, John falls asleep.


The next day he has a crick in his neck, but he can't find the energy to care. He gets dressed, makes tea and sits back in his chair. He has taken leave from surgery. Sure it would give him something to do, but he wouldn't be able to concentrate on it properly.


The day appears to be the same as every other day until Mycroft walks in.


“Ah Dr Watson. I am glad to see you are up.”


“What the hell do you want?!” John growls.


“Now Doctor, there is no need for violence.”


The glare John gives him resembles Sherlock's in every way. “What do you want?” he asks again, this time deadly calm.


“An offer.”


“What?”


“An assignment for you. To feel useful again.”


“A charity case. No. Get out.”


“Perhaps I should explain more. It is not mere charity. It is important and I feel that you are the best person to fill the position.”


“Not interested. Leave.”


“Not even if you can help care for someone else who needs you?” Mycroft inquires casually.


John snorts. “And who would that be?”


“The Avengers.”


“The Avengers?”


“The Avengers. I do not presume that you have heard of them. But perhaps you have heard of the battle that occurred recently. It has even managed to make the news here briefly. It would be the engagement with the aliens. Dreadfully messy business. During the fight, their handler was killed. They are in need of another. I thought you would be qualified, seeing how well you handled my brother.”


“No.”


“Come now Doctor. Be reasonable.”


John stares at him. “I don't have a choice in this, do I?”


“It would be easier if you agreed, certainly.”


John sighs. “There was a reason your brother hated you,” he mentions nonchalantly, “It's showing right now.”


“Indeed.” A barely detectable flinch. “I suggest you pack your bags. Rest assured that the rent will be taken care of while you are away. A car will be here in a half an hour. It has been nice talking to you Dr Watson, I'll see myself out.” He turns and leaves.


“Bloody Mycroft,” John says to the empty room. “Bloody, bloody bastard.”

“Captain Watson.” The man in front of him nods. John thinks he should be given an award in theatrics. He means- trench coat, all black clothes, 

eye patch.

 It's all a little too much. Aren't spies suppose to blend in? Especially the higher up ones?


Americans.


John doesn't bother correcting him on his title. “Director Fury.”


“Have you been briefed on your assignment?”


“Babysitting duty,” he replies dryly.


Fury smirks. “Best of luck. The last agent didn't stay too long.”


John nods.


A car takes him to Stark, now Avengers, Tower. “Subtle,” he comments.


The driver chuckles. “That's the boss for you.”


“Which one?”


“I work for Mr Stark. Happy Hogan,” he introduces himself.


“John Watson.”


Happy smiles. “I can't believe that they had to bring in a Brit to take care of them.”


“I'm well versed in dealing with difficult people.”


“You have a genius of your own?”


“Had,” he says shortly.


“Oh, I'm sorry.”


John shakes his head. “No, it's fine. It's only been a couple of weeks.”


“And they're calling you in?”


“Mmmhmm. Higher up thought meddling was a good idea.”


Happy nods thoughtfully.


The rest of the trip is spent in silence. When they arrive, Happy waves John off saying to don't worry about the bags and go ahead up.


He enters and steps into the elevator. It moves automatically, carrying him a very long way up. It stops at the seventieth floor and opens up to a large living room. Waiting for him are six different people. Of course he recognizes them from the files he read. Captain Rogers, who had be
