Chapter 1: Introduction
    




Chapter Text
For those who were here the first time around, welcome back. For those who are just tuning in, this story had already been completed. However, I am doing an update/rewrite to this story before following it up with a completed sequel. Chapters should be popping up quite quickly. Hopefully you enjoy!  *****Also, I sadly have no claim on anything Marvel owns including the Avengers.
 
 
 
Since there have been multiple requests to be able to compare the re-write to the original, here is the link for the story on fanfiction.net.
