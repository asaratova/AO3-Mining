Chapter 1: New Accords
    




Chapter Text
Peter sighed as he plopped down on his bed at the apartment he shared with May. It had been a long day. After aunt May had found out about his outings as Spider Man after the whole homecoming fiasco, he had been trying to be home by at least by midnight. But today it was past 1AM in the morning. Thank god it was a Saturday. Peter groaned as he got out of his Spider Man suit.“Honey? You home Peter?” May’s voice came from the living room.“Yeah Aunt May! What are you doing up?” Peter asked as he made his way to the living room.“I waited for you, come here.” May patted the spot next to her on the sofa. Peter sat down on next to her and turned to look at her. Before he could ask her anything however May started to speak.“Mr. Stark came here today.” Peter stared at her since she had been angry at Tony for giving him the suit and taking him to Germany for a fight. But May had understood the need for Peter to continue what he did and supported his decision.“Okay?”“He wanted to apologize. To taking you to that fight in Germany and about the Vulture and he wanted to give you a real internship in Stark industries as his personal intern.” May said and waited for Peters reaction.Meanwhile Peter was staring at his aunt with wide eyes. He could not believe what was happening. He knew the whole internship thing was a cover for the Germany. To keep aunt May from finding out. He never expected it to be a real thing.“Really?” Peter nearly squealed in delight as May handed him the envelop that held the official paperwork for his internship with Tony including a ID card. It was a red and gold colored card with Stark Industries on the top right corner and his photo on the front. He had his name underneath his photo and the Level 10 as his access level. He wondered what that meant but for the time being he pushed it to the back of his mind and flipped the card over. Back of the card had STARK in a hologram that was projected from micro holo projectors that was too small for even Peter’s enhanced eyes. It also had a gold color lanyard. He stared at the card with wonder and nearly jumped up and down.“Wow May! This is great! I can’t believe that this is happening!” peter continues to fan boy over his Pass and May watched with amusement for awhile and grabbed the Starkpad that had been lying next to her.“Pete? There’s more.” Peter stopped his squealing and sat down again to listen to his aunt.“yeah?”“Remember why Avengers fought?”“Yeah, something about some accords right? Mr. Stark and some of the members agreed but Cap and other rogue Avengers disagreed and something about Winter Soldier..”“Well Mr. Stark had been busy for past few months amending the accords, so they are fair for everyone. And now they are complete and had been posted on the UN official website for all to see. He said many of the vigilante superheroes had signed them already.”“That’s great if people agreed. I had already read them and I fully agree with them. They are not restricting the rights of enhanced people but they give them more rights and a chance to defend their actions on the field.” Peter said as May paused for breath. He personally agreed with the accords. He had already read the New version of the accords that was named as Global Special Task Force Accords- since no one liked to call them Sokovia Accords- the moment they were posted on the website. He had wanted to know why Avengers fought against this. As he said the new ones gave the rights that were lacking for enhanced people. It gave protection for them from people who wanted to experiment on them. And there had been another set of accords for Super Heroes who are underage and have secret identities. They protected the individual’s identity and any underage superhero was under another adult superhero. And the underage heroes were only called for field when it was absolutely necessary. As back up. He had been thinking about it. He only needed to find someone to be his supervisor.“So I guess you read the Accords for the underage heroes?” May’s question brought Peter to the present.“Yeah I read them. And I was hoping to ask you about it. I was planning on signing but I have to find someone for the adult supervisor.” Peter answered.“That’s the other thing I wanted to talk about. Mr. Stark gave me your copy of Accords. They are a little bit different from the official one. Nothing major, it just give you the freedom to continue your friendly neighborhood Spider Man work. And I read them and he also helped me to understand everything that was hard for me to understand and I agreed to them. After I agreed he signed them making him as your supervisor for more international and major missions that will be assigned to New Avengers by UN. He also said to let you think about it and sign if you wanted to, not because he said to.”   Peter was silent for a moment. Tony Stark, Iron Man Had agreed and signed his agreement as his supervisor. And he had tweaked the origin
