Chapter Text

Beep Beep Beep Beep
Peter cracked an eye open and glared in the general direction of his nightstand. The bright light of his clock assaulted his vision, causing him to once again snap his eyes shut. Groaning, he rolled over and patted his hand uncoordinatedly on the devilish piece of technology until he finally hit the button to stop the alarm.He almost slipped back into blissful sleep. Almost. But the lights in his bedroom snapped on, flooding the space with harsh light.“Friday…” Peter complained, grimacing and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.“My apologies Peter, but boss says that it’s time for the spider-child to get his butt out of bed.” Friday responds, at least sounding slightly apologetic.Peter, resigned to the fact that sleep was now hopeless, dragged himself out of bed and busied himself getting ready. Homework and books were thrown haphazardly into his backpack. A clean enough science pun shirt and pair of jeans were put on. His unruly bedhead was combed into less of a lion’s mane, but still a mess overall. Worn black converse were tied and the lights in his room automatically turned off as he grabbed his bag and dashed to the kitchen.“Mr. Good and Righteous.” Peter greeted, throwing his backpack on the island. Steve looked up from the stove and smiled in his direction.“I’m making eggs, you want some?” The super soldier offered. Peter nodded vigorously; Steve’s cooking was to die for. He grabbed a plate and held it out to Steve, who gave him a heaping serving.“Where’s mom and dad?” Peter asked with a mouth full of breakfast once he sat down next to his bag.Steve leaned against the counter next to the stove. “Pepper had an early meeting; I saw her leave as I was getting ready for my run. And Tony is probably in his lab, but you’d have to ask Friday.”Peter nodded and looked to the ceiling for confirmation.“You are correct Captain; Boss is in his lab.”Peter shoveled the last of his eggs into his mouth, then got up and dropped his dishes into the sink. He waved a quick goodbye to Steve as he grabbed his bag, then headed down to the lab.Tony didn’t even acknowledge his presence when Peter entered the lab, instead deeply concentrated on what looked to be the repulsor of one of the Ironman suits. Peter dropped his bag by the door and waited for a minute. No reaction, at all.Peter smiled. “Friday, play I’m Blue, volume 100.” He whispered and waited in bated breath for a few moments until he heard the familiar words blast from the speakers.
Yo, listen up here’s the story

About a little guy who lives in a blue world

And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue
Tony jumped and dropped the tool he was working with onto the bench with a clang. He spun around, the look of shock on his face so funny that Peter couldn’t help but burst into laughter.Once he could control his breathing, Peter went and joined his dad at the workbench.“Having Friday turn on my lights earlier? That was just plain mean.” Peter said, glaring lightheartedly at Tony.Tony grinned. “Well it worked, didn’t it?” Peter rolled his eyes and Tony laughed.They sat in silence for a couple minutes as Peter watched Tony tinker until Friday announced that Happy was ready to take Peter to school.“Oh wait!” Tony called out, stopping Peter as he went to grab his bag. “I almost forgot to tell you; Pep would’ve killed me. Tonight’s gonna be dinner with everyone.”“Like everyone everyone?” Peter asked, getting excited. Typically, in the tower it was just the Starks, which included Peter, Steve, Bruce, Sam, Bucky, and Nat. It wasn’t often that he got to see Scott and Cassie or the Barton kids.“Yep, the whole shebang.” Tony confirmed.Peter grinned and threw his dad a big wave as he ran out of the lab to meet Happy..“I can’t believe that you get to have dinner with the Avengers!” Ned exclaimed later at lunch.“Ned, I live with the Avengers. I have dinner with them almost every night.” Peter pointed out.“But still!” Ned continued.MJ rolled her eyes and continued to read her book, apparently not caring enough to add any commentary to the conversation..Peter was convinced that nothing, not even Flash, could deter his mood. His excitement for that night’s dinner had kept him running through the day. But as his Parker luck would have it, everything came to a stop mere minutes before the bell rang signaling the end of the day.Peter had finished the Chemistry test early and was staring out the window, willing time to go faster so he could go home.Time was called and everyone else put their pencils down and began to pack up.“Wait a second please! I have an important announcement!” Miss Kesler said. A couple of students looked up interested, but everyone else continued to chat and pack up.“This Friday, we’re going on a field trip to Stark industries!” She announced. The class fell so silent that you could hear a pin drop, not that Peter couldn’t instantly. All the excitement left him as dread replaced it,
