Chapter 1: Another Press Conference
    




Chapter Text
________________________________“Stark, it’s Fury.” came a rough voice from Tony’s phone.“Sorry, Nicky boy, but consulting hours are between eight and five every other Tuesday.” answered Tony before hanging up, “ Hey! Jarvis make sure that S.H.I.E.L.D can’t contact me outside of consulting hours.”He got a quick confirmation from the A.I. and went back to looking over the blueprints and paperwork for the rebuilding of the Stark Tower. S.H.I.E.L.D. had been on his back about having the Avengers moved into his tower, both Nick Fury and Maria Hill have been calling him almost constantly for the last four days after the attack on New York. Honestly, he has enough on his plate outside of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s calls, like the 23% of droppage in stock for his company and negotiations with the mayor and different senators who think that Stark Industries should pay for the damage caused during the attack; like it was all somehow his fault. Despite most of the public’s beliefs, Tony Stark has always been an outstanding CEO and businessman; people always seem to forget that he was raised to be in the business. And after giving Pepper the role of CEO, Tony actually played an even more integral part in his company, without having to deal with the large parts - not that he didn’t help out sometimes - he was able to fine tune the details of different departments and spend more time as the CTO and the  head of the R and D, introducing new ideas and helping along the changes taking place after S.I. stopped weapon production. Tony simply didn’t have time to deal with S.H.I.E.L.D. and whatever issues the state of New York had with him, he was already behind schedule with the setbacks caused with the rebuilding of the tower. “We are holding a press conference,” stated Pepper as she swept into the room, “ The state came to the decision that we have to pay for only 12% of the damage caused to the historical monuments that were hit.”“Again with the 12%? That’s never going to end anytime soon is it?” asked Tony.“Nope, it’s not. And just be thankful that I managed to negotiate it down to that, otherwise we would be paying for 40% of the damage.”“ I am forever grateful to the great Pepper Potts for negotiating so skillfully, I am in debt to you and repay you with a great amount of favours of the sexual nature.”“Of course you will.” replied Pepper rolling her eyes, “Anyway, how are things going on your end?”“Well, S.H.I.E.L.D. is still on my ass about housing the Avengers, but I managed to get a sign off for the future Stark Towers -  with your name on the lease by the way - from the contractor and construction will start on this tower in two days.” said Tony as he swiped away the blueprints and saved the paperwork on his interactive desk. “Anyway about the press conference, it will be held here tomorrow morning at ten in the main press hall. Be ready by nine. And before you ask, no, there will be no cards because I know you won't follow them, instead I’ll be there to regulate you.” Pepper stated as she made her way to him and wrapped her arms around his neck in a warm embrace.“And, I’m sure that we both had a long stressful day,” she whispered in his ear, causing Tony’s breathing to hitch, “How about we call it an early night and I could collect those sexual favors you were talking about and you could collect yours?” With a nip at his jaw, she sauntered out the room, leaving Tony standing there gasping like a fish.“Sir, your heart rate and body temperature is high, should I call for a doctor?” Came JARVIS’s voice almost sounding cheeky. Tony shook his head shooting a glare up to the ceiling and left the room while mumbling something about A.I.s being too smart for their own good and bits about donations to community colleges.
________________________________The next morning Tony and Pepper arrived at the press hall at nine thirty, Tony having convinced Pepper to share the shower and conserve water. Thankfully, there was nothing big to handle just review security and double check everything they had to announce. At around nine fifty reporters and their camera crews began to come in and settle in different spots around the room. At ten am the place was packed with reported from different magazines and news channels. Tony stepped up to the podium placed at the front of the reporters and almost immediately would have been blinded from the intense flashes of the cameras if not for his sunglasses. He cleared his throat and tapped the mic twice before he began, flashing his most charming grin.“Hey there everybody! How's it going? Now I know that there have been some speculations about me being dead from the footage captured of me falling from the wormhole a couple of days ago, so I just popped in to tell you that I am alive, but since you already see that, I'm going to tell you about some developments at S.I. instead. Gah! I know, boring, but you gotta do what you gotta do.” Said Tony gettin
