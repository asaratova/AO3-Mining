There’s a weight on Clint’s chest, making it hard to breathe and not helped by the tight atmosphere in the emptier than usual room, each missing person an added note in the tension. No one is speaking, something that would be a relief to Clint if it wasn’t so damned  wrong , a sense that sinks into his bones and only adds to the clawing anxiety and anger he feels. The silence is such a stark contrast to their usual post-battle debriefs, which are full of cheer and light weighted relief as they celebrate their victories, tease each other for their screw ups, and reassure themselves - and each other - that the failures can be fixed and didn’t… didn’t matter.There’s no victories to celebrate today. The failures  did  matter.Clint shuffles, trying to wedge himself more into the corner of the room. It’s the only location he can find where he has a view, imperfect as it is, of everyone present, from Tony pacing by the door; to Natasha cleaning her knife at the table with an angry glint in her eyes and sharpness to her movements; to the always shifting and currently soaking wet Daredevil in the opposite corner to Clint by the window. His face is blank, not helped by the black screens that are his eyes, but he seems nervous. Every so often he shifts in position, a grimace flashing across his face. Considering he’s still smoking from the flames that apparently had engulfed him when Steve found him, Clint’s not sure how he’s still standing. Daredevil’s armour’s fucking awesome if he’s walking away from that - according to him -  serious burn free.The paramedics had apparently agreed, judging by his presence here.Steve finally opens the door, Thor and Bruce a step behind. ‘Sam ---- fine,’ he says, his eyes on Clint, and a bit of the tension breaks under the sigh of relief, visible to Clint in heaving chests if not at this moment audible as anything beyond a low hum that might be words. Clint gives Steve a twitch of his lips that might have made their way into a smile, if he could get one past the weight on him. ‘Managed [knot? not?] [to?] [break?] anything in the [fall???].’ There’s a pause and maybe a noise - is that real or Clint’s imagination? - then he laughs, his eyes moving from Clint as he turns his head. ‘He said [some?]thing similar ---- paramedic cleared [him?].’Blinking in confusion, Clint follows Steve’s eyes and sees Tony sagging into a chair. Right, he must’ve said something Clint didn’t… well didn’t see. ‘How’d Sam manage that?’ Clint says and Tony looks up with a raised eyebrow.‘[I? Eye?] just said that- aaaand [you?] missed it because --- weren’t [looking? booking?] at me.’ Tony facepalms. ‘My [bad?]. How [fried?????] are your [aide? aid? aids?]?’Rearranging the previous conversation in his head until it makes sense, Clint raises his own eyebrow. ‘What do you think?’‘That [bad?] [something that might be a noise because his throat moved right?]?’ Tony turns his head suddenly and Clint, well used to using the visual cues of others to act as audio cues, turns to look at Steve too.‘[Clint?], do [you?] need anything [right? write? wright?] now?’ Steve asks. Clint shakes his head and moves his right hand in front of his lips, with only the index and middle fingers extended. ‘[Right? White?]… that[’s?] lipreading, [right?]’ Clint nods, feeling a touch of warmth as he realises Steve’s picked up some of the sign language Clint uses. Course, it would be nice if they all knew more - lip reading is exhausting, frustrating, guesswork - but beggars can’t be choosers.‘[Any? Many?] context [you? too?] miss,’ Natasha adds after waving to get Clint’s attention, ‘I[’ll] [fill? bill? till?] [in? bin? tin?] later.’ Clint smiles at her and she touches her left hand to her chin and moves it forward.  You’re welcome. ‘So,’ Steve (possibly) says, exaggerating the word a bit.Clint sighs and shakes his head. ‘Speak normally Steve, or I’ll miss even more.’A red blush creeps over Steve’s face as he ducks his head but nods. ‘Okay,’ he says when he raises his head. ‘Okay. [So? sew?]. What did [we? wee?] [do? due?] [right? write?]’Tony waves his arms around in the corner of Clint’s eye and he turns to look at him. ‘What did [we? wee?] [do? due?] [right, gotta be]? Wrong question!’  He pauses, then sneers, ‘[I? Eye?] don’t care about,’ Tony raises his fingers and wriggles them as quote marks, ‘’[team? teem?] morale’. Let[’s?] figure out [wear? where?] [we?] ---- up!’Realising Steve must have spoken, Clint snaps his head around to look at Steve, wincing a bit at the pinch in his brow and the way he’s biting his lip. Oh man, Captain America is  pissed . ‘[Alright? All write?] then [Tony? can’t be pony]. ---- [fuck?] up?’Was that ‘where did they fuck up?’? Yes, yes it was. So where did they fuck up?Probably from the moment they arrived, if Clint’s honest.********
