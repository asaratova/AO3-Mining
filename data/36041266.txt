Chapter Text
“What’ve you got for me today, New York?” Spider-Woman shouted as she swung through the city.The wind whipped through her jacket, sprayed with a white spider and webbed pattern over the red arms and gloves. Her yellow goggles displayed the jury-rigged heads-up-display connected to her work-in-progress A.I. ‘Karen,’ whom she lovingly named after plankton's wife from Spongebob.“Am I your wife, Penny?” Karen had asked, after Penny had explained Karen’s name to her.“I don’t think that’s how it works.” Penny had answered. But, it wasn’t a no as far as Karen was concerned.But regardless, Penny was eager to let out some energy. She didn’t have much in the way of friends, and did her best to conform to the nerdy persona people had seemed to apply to her before the spider-bite. It was useful as an additional layer of protection to her secret identity, but was often pretty annoying, as she wasn’t really able to do anything physically impressive, which often led to her getting antsy as her energy built up over the day.The wind whipped around her as she slammed down the button on her web shooters, a web attaching to a ledge below her. She soared past it, and her body jerked under her as the g-force of the bottom of the swing slammed her down. Her enhanced strength and durability allowed her to follow through painlessly, throwing herself around the city with abandon.“Police scanner indicates an on-going car chase with heavily armed assailants. No other superheroes have been spotted on the scene. Adding a waypoint to the HUD.” Karen told her, adding a marker to her overlay. It wasn’t super sophisticated yet so it was all one colour, something Spider-Woman intended on improving on soon, but it made navigation so much easier.“Alright, time to get to work!” She called out as she swung down. A congregation of police cars followed through the streets, rushing after a van, out the back of which two men shot back at the cops, bullets whizzing past them, some breaking through the windshields of the officers cars, and vehicles of innocents, barely missing some pedestrians on the street.“Better take them out quickly.” Spider-Woman said as she approached. It only took a moment for the gunmen to notice the strange woman swinging overhead. One of them fired up at her, their faces twisting in confusion, but Spidey effortlessly dodged, a chill rushing up her back as her spider-sense warned her of the danger, before the man even decided to pull the trigger.She thwipped a web onto the vehicle, and yanked herself forward, landing on the roof of the van. A web quickly disarmed the men, sticking the guns onto a nearby wall as they barrelled down the street. “Hey guys! Rush hour’s crazy, huh?” She quipped, before shooting a web at their chests, and shooting the other end onto a light post, wrenching them from the back of the van, and harmlessly hanging them over the street.Spider-Woman got low down on the van, and crawled across it, tapping on the driver’s side window. The man driving the wheel, a pretty stock standard bad guy as far as Spidey was concerned, looked at her confused, as most people would do seeing a weird teenager in an improvised supersuit clinging to the side of their crime-mobile.“Hey dude! I don’t know if you noticed all the sirens and the lights and stuff, but I’m gonna need you to pull over.” Spider-Woman said, pressing her face up against the glass. She carefully and subtly loosened the door, but didn’t open it.The man looked at her like she was crazy for asking such a simple thing, which Spider-Woman found quite offensive, really. Like he wasn’t the one flooring it down main street. The guy’s basically asking to get T-boned.He displayed his lack of conversation skills by drawing a gun on her, to which she dropped from view, a quick yelp escaping her as she scrambled around to the other side of the van.Spider-Woman punched through the window, ignoring the glass cutting into her, wincing slightly as she did so. She shot a web at the driver’s gun, wrenching it from his grip. The van crashed through an intersection as the spider tried desperately to hang on. Cars slammed into its side but the van rumbled on, scratching, splintering and destroying anything in its path. Quite a sturdy van.“What’s this thing made of? Vibranium?” Spider-Woman joked to herself, giggling slightly before it kicked in that she’s supposed to be getting this thing to stop destroying everything around it.“I did not detect any vibranium when I surveyed the van, Penny. Perhaps my scanners are in need of updating?” Karen asks as Spider-Woman tries to figure out what she’s going to do.“Just a joke, Karen!”
“Ah. Logging joke for analysis.”
“...Thanks?”Spider-Woman stuck a web to the top of the door, holding down the button to give herself a bit of extra length before jumping away, and swinging back, using the momentum to crash through the windo
