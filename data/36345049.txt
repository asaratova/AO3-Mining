Chapter 1: There's Glitter on the Floor After the Party
    




Chapter Text
Somewhere on the road to becoming an avenger, Peter Parker became a hero. He wasn't recognised as one sure, but who needs recognition from the media when your favourite deli gives you free good food after what felt like weeks of going hungry? Not Spider-Man. He was sitting on the roof of said deli sharing his life story with a very stubborn kitten who has since decided that his lap was the most comfortable place for sleeping. No idea how the kitten was on the roof but he appreciated the company after a long time of only talking to criminals and saying hello to random people in passing. He could have made new friends but he was an awkward teenager when he wasn't Spider-Man and Peter Parker had had no time to exist on his own. The kitten was asleep and he didn't want to leave her out in the cold. He would not admit it but he was also touch starved enough to take comfort from a random kitten who had found him an hour ago. She was a black ball of fluff with startling green eyes and he named her Loki. Yes, like the god of mischief, sue him for being unoriginal. The god wasn't ever going to meet him anyway. He had no connection to the avengers anymore and Loki was also kinda dead. It did put a damper on things.All he had to do was figure out a way to feed both her and himself while also having enough money to keep his apartment and afford to be Spider-Man. Job hunting was a hard task when you technically didn't exist, forging papers on the other hand is very easy when you regularly interact with criminals. He still kept that as a last resort though. Another try at a caf√© tomorrow and if that doesn't work, Peter Parker will exist somehow, even if that option was illegal. Hell, vigilantism was a crime so he didn't have to worry about committing a crime for the first time, he was an experienced criminal.The librarian was kind enough to sometimes buy him food when he was studying there for his GED. That certainly was not the case with most people and being unemployed was hard enough in this economy. And if Spider-Man was sometimes seen letting people steal from big stores, well he was no hero, not anymore. Loki purred in his lap and woke him from his thoughts, he still did have to sleep and he was quite far from his new, very overpriced for being such a shithole apartment. (If deadpool were here, he'd say that there should be more dialogue in a fanfiction but human interaction was not something Peter had the luxury of anymore and he did not know a deadpool.)He picked up Loki in the uncharacteristically quiet night and swung home. He didn't want to call the apartment home, home was with May. He didn't even call Happy's very expensive condo home. There was nowhere else unless you count the graveyard which made for a very sad thought to tell to his hypothetical therapist, one he'd get when he had even an ounce of financial stability. The floor of his apartment was littered with unfinished letters, he didn't want to throw them away just yet and he didn't have the strength to pick them all up and put them somewhere safe, that would mean acknowledging that he was never going to be Peter Parker again. Everything that was him was first someone else and he was a stranger to everyone. He didn't know what made him Peter except the smile on his face when Ned rambled and the way his heart raced when MJ came into the picture. He was nothing without May's awful cooking and Happy pretending to find him annoying. He wasn't Peter without being late to his decathlon meetings and his friends being extremely forgiving. He wondered sometimes if this is what they mean when they say ghosts, someone who has memories no one else does. Was Captain America this lonely when every single person he knew no longer existed? He understood him chasing after Bucky now, just a thread to the past, something that made him Steve and not just a fragment of a dead universe. He took himself away from this universe, was that a death too? Is the universe still the same if a singular person never existed or did he kill every person with his mistakes? He had a lot of time to wonder, his thoughts were the only thing keeping the old universe alive and he couldn't take that away. Loki was asleep in his arms as he entered his room. It was bare enough for people to assume no one lived there. He couldn't bring himself to unpack his stuff, that would imply permanence. That would imply that the people he decorated his first room with don't exist anymore. Existence was a big word, it was scary but that was essentially what he did. He had erased the old Ned and MJ from existence. The only shred of happiness he got was that May was gone before she could forget him, he would never see her new self but that was just a reminder that he would never see her at all. A comically loud shriek came from the street below and Peter followed it. Blood was smeared all over the road and a man in a red gimp suit w
