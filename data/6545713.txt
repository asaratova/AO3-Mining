Chapter Text
Darcy stared at the double blue lines on the white plastic stick that were the culmination of a fuck ton of bad decisions.  The end result of everything she never should have done. The cherry on top of a sundae full of stupid.  The Mothra of mistakes in a Godzilla’s worth of reckless ideas.  The...the...She’d run out of clever metaphors but whatever.  The final answer would not be affected by her coming up with a new one, no matter how hard she wished it was.  Not when she was currently carrying the zygote by-product of a major lapse of judgement, and everything was fucking, fucking, fucking terrible.The sex, though.  It hadn’t been terrible.  In fact, it had been pretty damn good...what Darcy remembered anyway.  They’d both been kind of plastered, which, okay probably she shouldn’t be remembering how good the sex was right now while she was trying to figure out what to do about the zygote situation.Was it a zygote?  It occurred to Darcy that she should have paid better attention in biology, instead of doodling Mrs. Darcy Way on her book cover.  And now she was humming the Welcome to the Black Parade which wasn’t particularly helpful with her decision making process.  She needed to focus.  Come up with a plan.  Take the next step.It should be zygote removal, right?  Because she was in no way prepared for the final evolve of said zygote.  Kids weren’t even a blip on Darcy’s radar at the moment.  More to the point, she’d never thought they would be.  To her, children were walking germ factories with no impulse control, or filters.  She had enough trouble with her own lack of impulse control and filter, and definitely did not need any extra in the form of a small, sticky human, thank you very much.For a moment her brain conjured up what the small, sticky human might look like, and she raced to shut that shit down immediately.  The last thing she needed was to mentally wax eloquent over the shared spawn of herself and Bucky Barnes.  At the thought of his stupid name, Darcy made a face.  How she had ever fallen into bed with a guy who preferred a nickname like that over the perfectly good first name ‘James’ was a mystery to her.  But she had fallen into bed with him, and now apparently she was going to have lie in that damn bed.  She was also going to sue the shit out of the pharmaceutical company that manufactured her birth control, because not being pregnant was sort of the whole point of their merchandise.  Clearly they had not gotten that fucking memo.  First, however, Darcy was going to pee on another stick, just to be sure.In total, she peed on twelve.  They were all positive.  The last one took longer to give a result, and she pinned all her hopes on it, but eventually it said the same thing all the rest of them did.  With a loud sigh, she tossed the offending test into the trash, and washed her hands.It wasn’t the end of the world.  Right?  This wasn’t the 1950s.  Options were available to her, should she wish to take them.  It would really only require one phone call to a clinic, and setting up a friend to drive her.  Or...or she could not do that.  There was always keeping the baby.  Darcy stared at her reflection in the mirror over the sink.  She looked like a person who was damn well panicked over a surprise pregnancy.  It was not a good look for her.  A few deep breaths later, she looked again.  Slightly less panicked, and still pregnant.  Also not a good look for her.  What she needed to do was talk to someone who would be completely objective, so she could figure out what to do next.That meant Jane was out.  Jane was wonderful, and an amazing friend, but she was quickly approaching her due date with her and Thor’s first baby.  All she wanted to do all day was discuss cribs, and breastfeeding, and the joys of impending motherhood.  Darcy figured that ruled her out as best possible person for the job.  This left Wanda, who was out of the country on some kind of press tour for her latest book, and Natasha, who had just gotten back from her honeymoon.  Natasha was the best choice, but there was no way Darcy was disturbing someone who might still be in honeymoon mode.  Of course there was always Clint.  Clint had been one of her best friends since childhood, when Darcy crashed her bike into his mailbox.  She was sitting in the road, bruised and fighting back tears, until Clint appeared out of nowhere with an Orangesicle in one hand, and a slightly rumpled, unopened band-aid in the other.  After that they were always close, even though he was a couple years older than her.  Like the big brother that only child Darcy never had.He was
