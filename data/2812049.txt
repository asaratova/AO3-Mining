Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It was one of those days. A day where Harry felt like he should have had a ton of work to do but for some reason, it was a slow day. He would have welcomed one of the bi-weekly alien invasions to break up the monotony and the insanity of it all. He kicked back on his desk and went through the paperwork that he had for the ten millionth time."Is it just me or is the key to madness constant and never ending repetition?"Harry looked up and saw her standing in the office door. The blonde had a black head band clipped over the top of her head. She wore a nice female business suit that stretched over every single inch of her body. She was a complete stunner wearing her sheer stockings even though her skirt covered them fairly modestly."Yes, never ending repetition," Harry agreed. He finally put his paperwork away and smiled. She sauntered over towards him to give him a kiss. "How are you doing Gwen?""Pretty good," the blonde said in an excited voice. She thought about taking the chair next to him. She had a better idea which situated herself so she was pretty much sitting pretty off by the side of his desk. "And for the record, business is booming this month. So you're stuck in a rut because of it, aren't you?""Not necessarily stuck in a rut," Harry commented. Gwen raised her eyebrow in surprise and Harry amended. "I guess a better description would be that I'm a hamster running on a wheel.""Well, welcome to the world of mundane business," Gwen said. She took a lollipop that was on a tin on his desk and slowly undid the wrapper. The blonde gave him one of those grins, popping the lollipop into her mouth. She slowly sucked on it. "But am I making things a little less mundane?"Harry smiled. He wasn't going to say a word but he was pretty sure that Gwen was making things a little less mundane with her actions."I might have an idea," Gwen said. She amended herself quickly. Gwen Stacy was always one to give credit where credit was mostly due. "Actually, I don't have an idea. But Kara and Barbara on the other hand, they might have topped themselves with this brilliant scheme of theirs."There was a moment where Harry looked at Gwen. She calmly removed the lollipop from her mouth and offered him a taste. While he took it, his eyes kept locked onto hers. His eyebrow raised when he continued to look at her."Should I be concerned about what those two collaborated on with each other?" Harry asked."I'm sure that it will be amazing," Gwen said. "They've been making all sorts of phone calls all day, you know. They wanted to surprise you. Consider it a bit of an early Christmas present. Even though it's a week off…we could really get something out for the holiday season.""Hmmm," Harry muttered. "You know, where are those two anyway?""They're working on something downstairs," Gwen admitted. She figured that Harry's curiosity would be grabbed heavily."Oh, are they?" Harry asked."I'm sure that they'd like to see you," Gwen commented. She could see Harry rise to his feet. His height was deceptive."You know, you might be the smartest girl of your age," Harry told her. Gwen nodded, beaming at the praise. "But you are an absolutely terrible liar."Gwen snorted. She was guilty as charged with that one."You were just as much involved in that as those two were…..or three if we count Donna?" Harry asked. "I know those two wouldn't have left her out of their masterful scheme.""Yeah, and there might have been a few others who contributed to it," Gwen admitted. She figured that there was no use in lying to Harry. He always seemed to know when someone was lying to him. It made dealing with him a challenge and a half. "But, I suppose that all of us should discuss it with you. I think that you'll be very interested in the idea they've cooked up.""I know, but I'm pretty sure that you'll be a good fit," Kara said. The blonde's hair clipped back and she wore a pair of eyeglasses. She wore a loose fitting red blouse and a black skirt that flowed down her legs. Her nice stockings and high heel shoes added to the assemble fairly nicely. "Yeah, I know…..I'm sure Harry will find out about it soon enough anyway.""He just did."Kara nearly jumped ten feet off of the ground. Barbara chuckled in amusement. The fact was she was just as startled by Harry arriving. She just did a better job of not showing it."When did you get here?" Kara asked him. Harry smiled at her. "Actually, you were standing there the entire time, weren't you?""Gwen tells me that you're up to something," Harry said. He grabbed Kara firmly by the waist and pulled her in.Barbara gave her a "someone just got busted" look. Kara scowled at her and was about ready to say something. Harry beat her to the punch though."Both of you have been up to something."Kara pumped her fist into the air. Harry backed her off towards the desk. He motioned for her to sit. He motioned for Barbara to sit."Hi, Harry," Donna said, popping her head around the corner. There were seconds wher
