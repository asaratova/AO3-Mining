 “You’re a pain the ass, Stark,” Barton growls, and before Tony can reply, Barnes interjects coolly, “Only when it’s his turn.”Rogers chokes, but Tony doesn’t even notice because he’s done a full-body pause and has turned his not-unsubstantial focus on the Winter Munchkin who’s been doing a pretty good job of pretending he hasn’t just turned Tony’s entire worldview on its head.See, Tony’s well-versed in multiple ways of annoying people. He’s never met anyone he couldn’t crack with nothing more than a few words; biting, tactless, flirtatious, it doesn’t matter. Whether he’s weaving outrageous tales as a distraction, to cruise over people’s defenses, or dropping casual observations that cause the object of his attention discomfort; the results vary, but they’re successes, nonetheless.It’s a natural talent, a honed skill, and an acquired taste.So, finally meeting someone who speaks his language – and it being the guy who’s had his mind and body put into the equivalent of a blender on puree for an hour – is just so many levels of Holy Fucking Shit. Barnes has been quiet almost the entire time he’s been here, and to have him voluntarily talking and flexing his stuff in Tony’s defense in front of his supposed best friend? “I think I’m in love with you,” Tony hears himself say.Barnes raises his brows in apparent surprise. “Because I let you top or –”“Bucky,” Rogers interjects, scandalized, and Tony’s never been more thrilled.He can admit that it’s a little bit because this is arguably the best thing to happen since the Rogues were returned to the United States, but also because the Problem he’s been wrangling with for the past month since the Rogues’ relocation to the Compound has seemingly solved itself: The Problem being that with no way to kick his former teammates to the curb without causing an international incident and putting in danger all they’ve worked for with the amendments to the Accords, Tony had been left with only his words to soften the blow.Or do the exact opposite, in some cases.Barton and the Witch are the easiest to rile up; Tony’s very existence – the need of him for both resources and funds, and his general presence as a whole – is more than enough to get them spitting mad in a matter of seconds.Tony takes no small amount of pleasure in goading them into it, but it’s a different kind of amusement to see that even when he’s genuinely helping them or being nice to them, their responses are vicious and cruel and flat out ridiculous to anyone who witnesses it.Variety, he finds, truly is the spice of life.And with Fury, Rhodey, and Carol making it clear that there will be no physical altercations or so help you, God, they can do nothing but fume; raising concerns from all and sundry that the Rogues aren’t quite right.A sentiment echoed with Romanoff’s behavior. She’d been the only one to know Tony before their acquaintance with the rest of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and she’s aware of the many masks he has purely because their collections are comparable. That he chose to stone-wall her with consistent, unwavering professional courtesy he only reserves for SI board meetings, infuriates and frustrates her to the bafflement of anyone who is unaware of Tony’s special brand of annoying that belies his affection.It’s the coldest and most distant Tony knows how to be, and with that line drawn, Romanoff isn’t coming any closer to him or his.Which was, unsurprisingly, the same way Rogers treated Tony with regard to one, Bucky Barnes.Rogers, Tony has come to accept, is only saddened and annoyed at the situation he’s found himself in rather than having any sort of feelings towards Tony himself.The engineer would be insulted considering all that has happened between them, the betrayals that ripped Tony to pieces on the floor of that Siberian bunker a year ago, but Rogers has always been more self-centered than he let others believe.Add the loss of the automatic esteem and respect of simply being Captain America; having to accept that Rogers isn’t above and beyond the chain of command thanks to Carol, and now Bucky’s behavior towards Tony, and well. The hits just keep on coming.Whether it’s Tony and Barnes' flirting over the comms with exchanges of, “On your six, handsome” and replies of, “Thanks, darlin’” to threats of, “I swear to God, I will give sex up for lent, Barnes” to moans of, “But doll, you’re Jewish”.His Rhodey-bear is jealous for all of ten seconds before he realizes that Rogers constantly looks like he’s having an aneurysm, and then Platypus is joining in on the fun with a groan of, “For Christ’s sake, all I ask is that you two remember to set the room to ‘privacy’ when we get back. Accidentally hearing your version of make-up sex was bad enough the first time, you can’t be exposing that to Fri.” And then it’s like opening a door or setting off a bomb because then the kids get involved, and suddenly Barnes spends half the time looking baffled that Peter, Harley, and RiRi want to hang out
