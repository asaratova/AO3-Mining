Chapter Text
Darcy wasn't born with a Soulmark, and though it was hard in those first few years when all the girls planned out how they'd meet their soulmate, she got over it relatively quickly. By age eleven, she was the independent tomboy who didn't need a man to make her happy. By sixteen, she realized that though she didn't need boys, they could be a lot of fun.
Sixteen was also the age when her Soulmark showed up. It just appeared under her left breast during the night in early October. Her mother wasn't exactly happy when she realized Darcy didn't plan on telling her (she found out while they were out shopping for winter clothes). Her daughter didn't want to lie to Mrs. Lewis, she just didn't want the customary party celebrating the birth of her soulmate.
In the end, Mrs. Lewis agreed not to throw the party, not only because of her daughter's wishes, also because of the oddness of her Mark. Forgoing the party was not unheard of, especially if the Soulmark was something particularly dark (poor Mrs. Graham's son's Soulmark read "Please don't die on me!"), but that wasn't the case for Darcy; her's was perfectly normal in that regard. What was strange about her Soulmark was that it was in the print you saw on old typewriters.
"Miss Lewis, Mr. Stark wished for me to remind you that your room is a place that exists. With a bed." Was marked in two lines across Darcy's rib cage. Mrs. Lewis saw it as a sign that her daughter's soulmate wouldn't have hands and therefore had to write with a computer. Darcy took it as a sign that she was going to one day work for Stark Industries (or at least stay at his place for a night or two).
Though Darcy didn't have much interest in it, suddenly, she knew she was meant for mechanical engineering. She applied herself in the last 2 and half years of high school and graduated with honors. At Culver, she excelled and she loved her classmates and professors, but still the misogynistic atmosphere was still overwhelming.
That's what led her to apply to Doctor Jane Foster's internship despite it not really being her area of expertise. She was responsible for making sure that Jane didn't fall apart or her machines (Darcy heard of this thing called welding, which meant that the homemade tech would stay upright and functional with minimal duck tape usage).
And then the Golden God fell from the sky (he was lucky that Darcy hadn't been able to tinker with her new taser [Dr. Selvig confiscated her last one after it successfully gave a jump to their van]).
After a not so quick tour of Europe with the Battle of London being the final stop, Darcy found herself with a job offer from the joint forces of SHIELD and SI.
Darcy would have her own place in the tower, and though it felt oh so wrong to her feminist heart, she couldn't wait to meet her soulmate. She was doing great things with her life, why not relish in it with someone who understood her better than anyone on Earth (or the universe, as Jane and Thor proved)?

Jane had left London early with Thor, leaving the heavy equipment to the interns.
Ian grunted. "Darcy, I thought you were all about woman power. You should demonstrate some of that power and help me move this stuff."
Darcy turned to see the man hunched like Quasimodo with a steel pipe around his neck. "Ian, you misunderstand; I'm not making you carry that because you're a man, I'm making you carry it because you're still an intern and I'm not." She smiled at him sweetly.
He took a few drunken steps towards Avengers' Tower before frowning even deeper than before. "Aren't we working with Thor and Captain America? They could carry this and me and still not break a sweat."
Darcy clapped a hand on what little exposed shoulder he had which, because of the weight of the equipment he carried, made his knees buckle like it had been one of Thor's overly enthusiastic pats. "Stop complaining or I'm gonna make you stay with Jane and Thor when they go at it."
Ian, who was red in the face from straining, suddenly went pale. "That's it old chap! Stiff upper lip and all! Make your mates across the pond proud!"
Darcy directed the flow of equipment from the moving truck easily and even let whoever was willing help Ian unload.
She had a minor science!gasm when she saw her workshop. It was state of the art and packed with tools that Darcy had never even heard of. Originally, she was going to have Ian reassemble the tech, but she couldn't not. She shunned everyone, including a very put out Dr. Banner, before blasting music through her iPod speakers and getting to work.

Darcy was not Jane. Darcy knew how to stop for the night and sleep for at least 8 hours and feed herself. This is why she was so embarrassed when she woke up suddenly at 4 am, head sticking to the cold metal table. The last thing she remembered was turning off her music at 12:00 and swearing that she would only rest her eyes f
