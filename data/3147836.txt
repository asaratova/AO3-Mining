Chapter Text


1/January Stark shoved a set of keys, a map, and a credit card at him as Steve hefted his duffel bag over his shoulder.  “Take the Land Rover. It has four wheel drive and will get you up the mountain. I know you don’t like the cold, but the cabin is warm and stocked.  Use my card to get what you need and we’ll settle up later. No one will find you.  I’ve disabled the GPS on your phone, so it’s not worth a damn as a map, but no one can track you either if you choose to use it.”Tony shoved his hands in his pockets. “Call. Don’t call. But don’t come back until you’re ready. And if that’s never, that’s okay. I won’t judge.”Steve nodded, grateful for the offer. He took one last look around the apartment he’d shared. He stepped on his own heart as he walked out the door. ***** The soldier leaned against the doorway in stunned disbelief and rage--the only sorts of emotions to course through his veins these past two years.Steve had given in to his demand, offered it up as a gift. Whether through fear or cowardice, he hadn’t complied. The price had been too high.  He hated Steve.   ***** Darcy sat on her bed, her heart breaking for the best friends who couldn’t cross the chasm of hell this time.
