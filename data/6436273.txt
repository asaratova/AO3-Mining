Chapter Text
Whatever Tony had been expecting when Steve asked to meet with him, it had not been this.“You want me to become the Avengers Pack’s omega?”“Yes, it makes sense. No, wait,” holding up a hand to forestall the protests, Steve continued. “It does make sense. I’ve been thinking about this for a while and you are the right choice. You’re already providing for the Pack. We live in the space you provided and eat food you pay for. Not to mention all the weapons and protective gear you turn out. If we brought in another omega, there would be tension over that even if we could find an omega willing to put up with it. You’re outside the military and the SHIELD chains of command which is essential for a pack omega, especially given the sensitive nature of the Avengers Pack. And, frankly, Tony, there is no one else in the pack with the temperament to become omega. Thor and Bruce are both out for obvious reasons. Clint is not stable enough and Natasha is obviously not a valid choice. We could bring an omega in, but with you already in the provider’s role and trusted, it would be a nightmare.”Well, laid out that way, there wasn’t much sense in arguing with Steve. Tony even sympathized with the position and his rational mind had come to the same conclusions. After all, running these kinds of scenarios was one of his talents. But, he wasn’t sure he agreed with the foundational proposition as it were. “Why do we need an omega at all? They aren’t necessary to the health of a pack and we’re doing alright without one.”Omegas were not common in modern packs, especially since most pack bounds were so loose now. Packs were the bedrock of society, allowing competing human needs to be handled within an organizing structure. People, in modern life, were members of multiple packs – at home, at school, home, etc. The ancient tradition of a single pack membership for all aspects of your life was almost gone, surviving only in special cases. People scent bounded to multiple packs and spent their lives negotiating those relationships. There were even temporary packs that formed in childhood and vanished as children grew.It was rare for packs to have omegas in modern times, although Steve had been making noises about needing one. Tony knew he himself was an outlier since the Avengers was the first pack he had belonged to since he was a child, so his experience was unusually limited. He had never joined a friend-bond pack since he had always been out of step with his peers (going to college at 15 did that to you); and he certainly couldn’t have joined a Stark work-bond pack with his position. But still, he did see a lot of packs and mostly they didn’t have omegas, just alphas. True those were mainly family and business packs and a few social packs, not a War Pack (Steve always said it with capitals) like the Avengers.Tony knew that the Howling Commandos had Bucky Barnes as their Omega (everyone knew that). He didn’t have a lot of knowledge of current War Packs as the military tended to be secretive about them. He knew that not all units were full Packs, but that many of the elite units were. Most Packs were loose affiliations, organizing around a common goal or social structure and most people were members of several, but War Packs…“War Packs are different” (Tony thought “There are those caps again.”) Steve replied, “They need more stability and stronger ties and someone to link those ties to. An omega gives the pack a center and provides a counterbalance to the alpha. The Howling Commandos wouldn’t have worked as well without Bucky as a counterpoint to me. And there are advantages to being the omega – you would be integral to the pack and have the deciding voice on all pack matters, such as new members.”Well, that was an excellent carrot to dangle thought Tony. However, becoming an omega was a major life commitment. Omegas did not socialize outside their packs. The restrictions on socialization had not eased in modern times and that was probably one of the reasons that there were so few omegas. He had known only two packs with Omegas – EHI, his biggest materials supplier, had an Omega in its C-level suite Pack. She attended high-level negotiations with a phalanx of pack members to prevent anyone from getting too close. Then there was the famous Bakker Pack that was organized around its patriarchal Omega. Ben Bakker, the Omega that Tony had met, had ruled that Pack’s Alphas; that was evident even in the limited interactions Tony had had with him when Howard had considering contracting him to the Pack when he was eleven. And “limited interactions” was the key – neither Omega generally socialized outside the Pack and they were rarely seen. Tony had only met them because of unusual circumstances. He wasn’t sure that he could manage that much restriction. He certainly wasn’t willing to give up the very few people he cared about, Pepper, Rhodey and Happy.And the restrictions on
