Chapter Text
“Nick!”The man turned to look at his lover, sighing at the look in those green eyes.“What is it, Harry?”The other glared at him, “you actually have to ask me what there is? You know what it is that bugs me.”Sighing again, he turned towards his lover, taking in the frown on their face, as well as the look in those green eyes, “I have a reason for doing this, Harry.”Grumbling, the Brit threw his hands in the air, “so? What about me, about us? Are you telling me that you need to play dead just so whatever is going on can be resolved? Why would it need to be you, why can’t it be someone else who takes on this task, just this once.”Nick shook his head, “you know I can’t do that, Harry, you know that you would have done the same thing, for the same reasons, were you in my shoes.”Grumbling, the other man looked away before sighing, “I know, that doesn’t mean I like it.”Approaching his lover, he wrapped his arms around the smaller man’s shoulders, pulling him to rest against his chest.“I know that, but I need to do this, we all need to do something to make sure HYDRA won’t be able to operate in SHIELD’s shadow any longer. Especially with all the enhanced that are coming out of the woodwork.With SHIELD looking over the Avengers, who knows what they’ll do with all those enhanced individuals at their beck and call. I will not stand for that, just as I know you won’t either.”Sighing once again, Harry laid his head against his lover’s chest, “I know that; I know this is the best choice, for the best reasons, but I still don’t like it.Why does it have to be Steve and Natasha, won’t you be able to call Tony and get him to go over everything in the SHIELD database? Exposing HYDRA like that?”Nick shook his head, “Stark is one of their major targets, even at SHIELD he’s seen as a threat, should he ever turn rouge. HYDRA will never let it come to that, the moment they suspect anything, they’ll be initiating Project Insight a whole lot sooner than they’ll be planning on doing this.Between Steve’s patriotism and Natasha’s spy qualities, they’ll be able to complete this mission, out HYDRA and stop project insight from ever starting – in a way that Stark would never be able to.”Sighing once again, Harry nodded, before taking a step back, “and this has nothing to do with HYDRA’s interest in me?”Nick shrugged, “that might be one of the reasons, after all you are one of the most powerful beings in the universe – being the Master of Death and all that, if they get a hold of you, who knows what that would mean for the rest of us.”Harry snorted, “if I remember correctly, that was the exact reason you came after me in the 90’s, to see what it was that I could do for SHIELD and how they, and you, could use me in the bigger picture.”Nick looked away, “I must admit that wasn’t the best move I made, but I am glad I did, seeing as it made me meet you and see that only mistrusting enhanced individuals wouldn’t bring us to where we wanted to go. Add to that my encounter with Carol, and the idea of the Avengers started to form.”“Only down point is that with you making contact with several enhanced, aliens or mutants, so did HYDRA, and we all know what they used that knowledge for.”Nick nodded, “it’s again one of the reasons I need SHIELD and HYDRA to be separated, I know what we could accomplish if we came out into the open and operated in the best interest of those enhanced. Away from HYDRA we can work towards protecting the Earth from villains, as well as another invasion.If New York though me anything, it is that the best choices are our own, as well as that an invasion is inevitable – it is just a matter of time, which will only be made difficult if we’re fighting an inside enemy.”Looking away, Harry nodded, “it is inevitable.”Looking down at the other man, Nick frowned, “you know something.”Harry nodded again, “I do, but I can’t share it, I cannot mess with some of the fundamental truths of the universe, even if I know more than I can share. This piece of information could potentially alter the outcome of what is going to happen, should I share it.”Nick frowned, “so again, the right reason not to share it.”Harry smiled sadly, “I know, I shouldn’t question your reasons to do something, even if I don’t like it, when I do the exact same thing – with you not liking it.”Nick sighed, before pulling the Brit close, pressing a kiss to the other’s lips, “I promise this isn’t a forever goodbye, I will be able to see you again, it just might take me some time.”Reaching up to his tip toes, Harry pressed a kiss of his own to Nick’s lips, “I know, see you soon.”Standing in front of his computer Harry frowned at all the things he saw appearing, his eyes growing larger and larger at what he was seeing. Growling at the implication of seeing this information on the internet of all things.Nick had wanted this to be resolved without all this information becoming public knowledge, this, s
