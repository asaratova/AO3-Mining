Chapter 1: I’m too insecure in my abilities to write an actual Avengers fic whOOPS
    


Notes:
lmao i have no idea what i’m doing but i’m doing it anyway. i decided to do this at 3am tbh, seemed like a good idea at the time. this may or may not be my way of easing myself into writing for this fandom after stalking it for years lol. let’s hope this helps make me more comfortable writing them

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)

I went down to the kitchen bc I wanted some coffee but for some reason @SMOfficial likes to do his homework on the fuckin CEILING

nat @blackwidow 
In reply to @crimsonwizard
I didn’t even notice until I looked up after making the cup and he was just... There. Long story short, I spilled coffee everywhere and my hands and chest are burned.

wait, homework?? is spider-man a student?!??!

spidey @SMOfficial 
In reply to @steponmyneck
fuck.

Tony S.  @iamironman

Yes, Spider-Man is a student. No, we will not be disclosing his specific age or what level of education he is currently in. We all would appreciate if Spider-Man was given at least some form privacy as it is, quite frankly, none of your business.

you know it’s serious when he uses proper capitalisation and punctuation spidey @SMOfficial
In reply to @r0tten
Okay but seriously, please give me at least enough privacy to finish school. I have enough stress with the fighting crime thing I've got going on. Having to worry about people hunting down my classmates and teachers doesn't need to add any more stress. spidey @SMOfficial

Also, that wasn't meant to come across as me targeting you or anything! You were just the first person I saw in the replies jen @r0tten
