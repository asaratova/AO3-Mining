Chapter Text
The Infinity Stones came into creation at the beginning of each universe. Time, Power, Mind, Soul, Reality and Space. Each was an extremely powerful object, representing a different aspect of the universe. Every universe in the omniverse had tales of the Infinity Stones. The Heart Stone, the seventh and long forgotten stone, was special. 
Only one Heart Stone existed in the entire omniverse. It held the combined powers of all six Infinity Stones and the power to know the hearts of every living being. The Seventh Stone existed as a failsafe. Because where there was once life, there must always be life. If a universe died and disappeared from existence, it would cause a domino effect, spreading to each universe in the multiverse and cause the eventual collapse of the entire omniverse.
