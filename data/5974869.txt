Chapter Text
“I’m really not sure I want to meet anyone who Jane and Darcy think would be the perfect guy for me,” Daisy mumbled to Fitz as they walked into the restaurant. “I mean - don’t take this the wrong way, Fitz, but they think you’re the perfect man and…”“I’m not your type? I’m so hurt,” Fitz clutched at his chest, grinning. Daisy elbowed him lightly in the ribs, grinning back.“Well yeah, kind of.”“Don’t worry. I trust them,” Fitz said airily.“I have this feeling of impending doom,” Daisy mumbled darkly as they spotted Jane and Darcy, sitting in a booth together. They both saw Fitz at the same moment and jumped up, hurrying over to grab him in a tight embrace, both kissing him, touching his face with their hands.Daisy glanced around a little sheepishly, wondering where her supposed date was.“He just went to the bathroom,” Darcy said, spotting her nervous expression and letting Fitz up for air - or actually, no, she was just giving Jane a turn to snog him breathless, Daisy realised. Soon they had Fitz tucked in between them in the booth, both of them snuggling close to him. Daisy felt very much like a third - (fourth?) - wheel, as she slipped in opposite them. But there was a filled water glass on her side of the table, a paper napkin that looked as though someone had been awkwardly pleating it, so she guessed her date really did exist.Reduced to double dating on Valentine’s Day, she thought glumly, keeping her eyes averted from the lovey-dovey trio across the table. What even is my life?A shadow fell over her then, and she glanced up. And up, her jaw dropping ungraciously.“Hi, I’m Steve. You must be Daisy.”Darcy giggled at the flabbergasted expression on Daisy’s face. “Come on. I’ve seen that sign on your desk often enough. Did I ever tell you that Steve has a known weakness for small feisty brunettes?”




Notes:


(The sign Darcy refers to is a Trust Cap sign seen on Skye/Daisy’s desk in early S2)
