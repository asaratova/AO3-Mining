Chapter 1: if it makes you less sad, i will die by your hand
    




Chapter Text
The Winter Soldier can’t remember what a bullet piercing his skin feels like, or if he’s ever known. He can’t recall if the blade of a knife has ever gotten past his armor. He doesn’t know if his bones have ever been broken, though he does know that something happened to him, once (he can’t remember how long ago), that gave him a metal arm.__________________________________________The Winter Soldier is good at what he does – or so he’s told. He’s a ghost in the field, untouchable by targets and allies alike. The Winter Soldier can do more than any man, because he’s not a man; he’s a well-oiled machine, the fiercest weapon on the shelf. He’s the reaper that never fails to collect the lives that have been (not by him, never by him) deemed finished.The Winter Soldier, however, knows what pain feels like, can remember it even when he forgets. It’s a pain he can’t escape because it’s inside his head. Sometimes he feels like his brain might rot if he’s left out of the cold for too long.__________________________________________He’s not entirely sure why he knows certain things because he can’t recall learning them. The Winter Soldier knows a handful of languages (Russian, German, English – probably more that he isn’t even aware of); he knows how his arm works and how to do basic repairs; he knows how to use guns and grenade launchers, as well as how to pilot aircrafts and drive automobiles; he also knows how to fight, how to block and how to land when he’s pushed or pulled, and he knows how to kill with a quiet efficacy that no one else he’s come across can rival. He doesn’t remember learning these things, but he remembers how to do them, always, because that’s all that’s important.The Winter Soldier knows how to follow orders, too; knows that if he doesn’t then there’ll be more pain and more pressure in his head. Each time, he thinks he might explode, but he never does, and all that’s left is a fleeting thought of “why this time?” before he has to forget the pain and focus on the mission. Sometimes his mission is to be frozen again (and it is again because he knows he’s been frozen before, just doesn’t know how many times or for how long). When he’s frozen he can’t remember or forget and he’s not sure which is worse – or if either is even bad – but he ends up confused no matter what.__________________________________________His handlers have a routine for him after each defrosting. He can remember a few of the times vaguely, just enough to know this is what he does, what he’s always done, that it’s normal. His heartbeat slows down and he breathes a little easier once his mind can settle on the thought that he knows this and what comes next. Sometimes words are in his mind that he can’t control, whispering to him in a soothing voice he’s never heard before. The words never mean anything to him so he forgets them like everything else… but sometimes they come back and, he thinks, it’s not really forgetting.The Winter Soldier has memories, but they don’t fit as well together as he thinks they ought to. Sometimes, when he’s being prepped for a mission, he can see images behind his eyelids when he blinks. He sees a circle on a door with blue eyes in the reflection just before the ice takes him under. It’s him, he understands, but the hair on his head is short and it’s not now and he thinks it means he’s been through this for a while.Sometimes he can remember seeing an older man; he had a mustache and drove an expensive car. There was a crash that he knows he caused because he can still see it through the scope of his sniper rifle. (It’s a weapon he’s always preferred, for whatever reason.)He doesn’t know that he used to remember other things. It’s been a long time since he fought against his handlers. He doesn’t remember that, either.With all his confusion, there are things he knows, things he doesn’t forget.He is The Winter Soldier. He is an assassin. He works for HYDRA, is part of its foundation (but he isn’t HYDRA and he doesn’t heil it). He knows he has missions and handlers. He knows he has a metal arm with a red star near his shoulder. He knows they wake him when they really need to get something done because he doesn’t fail, he can’t fail, why would he?He knows he gets ‘prepped’ and ‘wiped’ and ‘put on ice.’ He knows it’s because he’s dangerous (but at the same time, no threat to them). He knows he’s an asset, that he’s important to his handlers, and that he has been for a while. He knows, he knows, he knows, and yet he doesn’t. It’s meant to be that way.__________________________________________The only time The Winter Soldier can remember feeling anything is when he’s strapped to a chair getting his brain fried. Sometimes it makes him remember things he thinks he forgot the last time the machine encased his head and arms. He remembers a question popping into his head, refusing to settle down until he said it out loud. His voice
