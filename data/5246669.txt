A Vampire’s Love Come with me to the Carpathian Mountains, she said. It’ll be fun, she said. We can hike and enjoy the views, she said. So far it has not been fun!
When my best friend said she was coming here on a holiday and that she’d pay for me to tag along, I figured she might be right. We only got here yesterday and she’s gone off with some guy already. She’d asked me not to come back to the room for a few hours whilst they had ‘fun’ so I’d decided to go for a hike. Unfortunately for me, it had started to rain and I’d become lost. Now it’s getting dark and I can hear wolves howling.
I’m moving quickly through the woods, heading in the opposite direction to the wolf howls. Every instinct in my body is screaming at me to run, run fast! I know that all that will do is waken the wolves’ chasing prey instincts so I try to keep to a fast walk. I’m slipping and sliding in thick mud and I’m soaked to the bone. I can’t see through the heavy rain and I can’t hear anything except howls.
A howl sounds scarily close to me and I spin round to look behind me. As I turn my foot slips out from under me and I slide down an incline. As I stop the ground beneath me cracks and I fall into a large cavern. I fall through the ceiling of the cavern, stabbing myself in the side on a piece of wood as I fall. I land on top of some kind of stone crypt and lay there for a few moments, blood pooling beneath me.
I groan and slide off the crypt, realising it’s cracked along the top now. My blood slowly runs into the crack and I try to get up using the crypt to bare my weight. As I do my hand scrapes across the dirt on top and I see a name. Vlad Dracul. That’s funny, that’s Count Dracula’s name. Must be some kind of tourist attraction. It’s obviously been abandoned for a long time. I gasp and clutch the wound on my side.
Suddenly there’s a growl from inside the crypt and I see fingers poking out through the crack, slowly pushing one half of the cracked top off. Oh shit! Either I just entered an episode of The Walking Dead (which would be great if Daryl showed up to save me) or Dracula is real! I look around to see if there’s a way out and I notice a crevice in the rock. I head over to it and squeeze in. There’s just enough room for me to crawl through it.“Wait! Come back!” I hear an accented voice behind me.Like Hell am I waiting for him to eat me. I continue crawling, seeing the world tilt around me as I lose more blood. Suddenly a huge black wolf clamps down on my trouser leg and starts pulling me back. As I’m dragged back into the main part of the cavern the wolf turns into a gorgeous looking man with long dark hair and goatee. I kick at him and try to slide back into the crevice but he clamps his hand round my ankle and I can’t move.“I know from your memories that your blood showed me, that you know who I am.” He says smoothly.“So?” I snap.“So you know that there’s no use running from me.” He states matter-of-factly.“So I should make it easy for you to kill me?” I laugh.“You’re bleeding. All I wish to do is help you.” He says kindly.“And why would you want to help me?” I gasp, wincing at the pain in my side.“I went to sleep a long time ago because I became bored. You intrigue me, which is definitely not boring.” He says, tilting his head slightly.“Great.” I snap.He frowns at me then pulls my ankle so I’m lying flat on my back. I go to hit at him but he grabs both of my wrists before I can even blink and pins them to my chest. I try kicking but he sits on them so I can’t move. He uses his free hand to move my top up, exposing my wound. I groan when I see it. It’s more on my stomach than my side and it’s horrid, jagged and deep. He leans down and starts laving his tongue over the injury.
I gasp as his tongue comes into contact with my skin and my pussy starts to get wet from the sensation. I should not be getting aroused by a vampire licking up my blood! But I am… I start to struggle again and he just smirks at me. I gasp in shock when I see that the wound is healing the more he licks it.“Healing saliva so victims don’t bleed to death.” He smirks.“Gee that’s reassuring!” I say sarcastically.He chuckles and goes back to licking my wound. When it’s closed completely he starts cleaning all the blood up, licking every part of skin that’s stained with it. I feel my juices soaking my panties more with every inch he licks. When he’s done he releases me and stands up.“So, what are you going to do now?” I ask warily, sitting up and running a hand over my newly healed stomach.“Release you.” He says.“Release me?” I ask, looking up at him quickly.“Yes.” He nods.I slowly stand up and a wave of dizziness crashes down on me. I feel myself falling before I’m gently grabbed in his arms. The next thing I’m aware of is him carrying me into a huge dark castle and calling for Reinfield. When I wake I’m
