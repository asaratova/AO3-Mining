Third Person P.O.V
Tony Stark was many things. An Engineer, a Genius, Philanthropist, Former Play-boy turned husband to two Super-soldiers but the one thing he most defiantly wasn't was a father. Tony had proven enough times that he wasn't a father to mothers bringing children out to the news claiming his parentage to their children. He'd always said if he did have children he'd help in anyway possible, be involved as much as the parent or child wanted him to be but that had never been the case.That was until the day he took in Peter Parker.********************When he first met Peter it was all about getting Spider-Man on the team. They'd been watching him and had taken pity on the guy getting his ass beat black and blue, even if he did win after the fights started. They planned on training him up and then bringing him onto the team that was until Tony went looking and found out some interesting things, like the fact Spider-Man was a Fifteen year old boy at a STEM School for gifted kids."You're kidding? He's a child Tony. A literal Child, how does he think it's ok to go gallivanting around Queens like that?" Steve asks, his voice held a tone of disapproval and shock as he watched this same kid fling him self from building to building like it was nothing."He's going around in Pajamas. Look at that." Tony mutters shaking his head a little as the kid flew by the screen in a red hoodie. "How is he even swinging around like that?" He mutters and the others shrug.Â "We need to intercept him, at the most we'll train him but we can't let him put himself in so much danger." Natasha mutters, wincing ever so slightly when Peter gets hit by a large truck and breaths a small sigh of relief when he comes up holding it like it was nothing."So who's gonna go and break the news to his Aunt that her little boy is flying by the seat of his pants to fight a bunch of ass holes on steroids?" Clint asks, watching the screen as said 'little boy' lands harshly on his back after being thrown back a few feet. The team all shot looks at each other, Bucky leans back a bit on the sofa with a snort."Don't tell her. If she doesn't know then it's not our job to tell her, just say it's something like an internship or something stupid and tell him what's really going to happen." Bucky's voice chimed in and that had silenced the room. Tony counted to ten and waited for someone to argue before heaving a heavy sigh."Alright. I'll be back by dinner. See you lovely destructive monsters in a while." Tony waltz's over to the Elevator and winks a bit at his husbands as the doors closed.****************That was a few months ago. He'd met the kid and his aunt, started training him and bringing him around the others more and more to get used to them. May had unfortunately found out about Spider-Man after the kid fought an annoying little pest calling himself the Vulture, made the poor kid miss his homecoming with the guys daughter. Was a big hoorah, but anyways, Tony sent the kid a new suite as a 'you-did-good' gift and the kid had ecstatically tried it on, May walked in and from what Tony and the rest of the team had learned she has one of the worst mouths in the world for swearing. Tony likes to think she took it well as she let the training continued, well...with a warning that if Peter got so much as a scratch from training that she'd beat them all with a spoon.Obviously that wouldn't happen but they understood her concerns and kept bruising and injuries down to a minimal. After that Tony had started noticing his husbands taking quite a shine to the kid, to the point that they both entered 'Parent-Mode'. This was Tony's favourite mode to tease them about because they'd lecture, threaten and baby the kid until he'd walk off a blushing mess. Tony remembered the first time it happened, Peter was climbing on the ceiling and Steve didn't agree with that.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Peter! Don't go climbing on the ceiling! Your shoes are filthy!" Steve's voice called out, a glare on his face as the boy rolled his eyes."I'm fine Steve and I'm not wearing shoes. I'm wearing socks, See?" Peter proceeded to dangle from his hands off the ceiling to show Steve his 'Captain America' socks, that of course had the man go redder than a cherry as he tried to control his anger."That is not the point Peter, it's Dangerous. You could fall and hurt your self, then what? We'd have to explain to your aunt you were being nothing but a troublesome toddler and climbing walls again and let her rip into not only us but yourself?" Steve started his lecture and Peter scoffed a bit before glancing at the other soldier in the room who looked amused by the situation."Wow, I'm offended. Captain America socks and not Bucky bear socks? Or are you wearing undies with my face on them?" Bucky teased lightly and Peter rolled his eyes, Bucky shook his head. "Seriously, come down from there before he climbed up and uses your butt as a pair of bongo's. I know from experience t
