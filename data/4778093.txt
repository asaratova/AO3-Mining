Summary:

Imagine kissing Killian Jones awake from the sleeping curse, but he keeps his eyes closed to scare you





Chapter Text
You swear you were going to kill Zelena. Apparently, Killian had lost his value to her, so she had put him under a sleeping curse. You couldn’t possible describe the terror that filled you when Emma and David had told you about it. While the pirate did get on your nerves, you were still good friends with him. You immediately rushed to Mary Margaret’s apartment to find Killian lying on the couch.
“Oh, Killian,” you sighed as you rushed to his side and pushed back his hair covering his forehead. Mary Margaret kneeled down beside you and wrapped an arm around your shoulder.
“We were thinking that you might try to awaken him,” she said.
“But, I, I mean,” you sputtered. “Milah was his true love, not me,” you told her as your head fell in disappointment. It was no secret that you and Killian flirted with each other quite a bit, but that’s all that had happened.
“Never hurts to try,” David commented. Millions of thoughts raced through your head before you finally decided to just go for it. You slowly lowered your head to place a sweet kiss on Killian’s lips. You waited a couple of seconds before your heart fell as Killian continued to lie there.
“It didn’t work,” you mumbled.
“Perhaps a second kiss would do the trick,” Killian murmured out the side of his mouth. You laughed as you whacked Killian’s chest.
“That isn’t funny, Killian,” you scolded half-heartedly.
“You can’t blame a pirate for trying,” he responded as he finally opened his eyes. You both sat there staring into each other’s eyes for a moment.
“I love you,” you whispered.
“Aye, I love you as well,” Killian said as he pulled you in for another kiss.
