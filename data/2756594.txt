Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter's heart pounded loudly in his chest at the sight of Steve Rogers.  His perfectly sculpted ass jiggled slightly with every step he took on the treadmill, sending sparks of electricity through him, going directly to his groin.  The brunette unconsciously licked his lips.
He mindlessly went through the rest of his workout, never taking his eyes from Captain America.  His breathing increased as the muscular blonde stepped off the treadmill, sweat-soaked shirt clinging to his pecs, leaving nothing to the imagination.  He had to act now, before he lost his nerve.
Peter crossed the gym and found himself at the locker room door at the exact same moment as Steve.  Their hands brushed reaching for the handle and the young man blushed in spite of himself.  "Go ahead," he motioned chivalrously with a smile.
"Thanks.  I'm Steve.  Steve Rogers," he introduced, extending his hand.  "I've seen you here before.  Peter Parker, right?" he asked, removing his clothes for a shower.
Peter nodded.  "Yea.  Listen, would you want to grab a drink?"
Steve paused before removing his pants, then turned to face Peter.  "Look, you're a sweet kid, but...well, that's just it.  You're a kid.  I'm sorry," he said gently, resting his hand on Peter's arm.
He lowered his head, face flushing with embarrassment.  "No, I... I'm sorry," he stammered turning to leave, forgetting his gym bag in his haste.
Steve picked the bag up and saw Peter's address on the luggage tag.  He showered and was at his door in under an hour.
