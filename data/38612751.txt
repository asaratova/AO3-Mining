She slips out of the trees like a ghost. He only knows one other person who can move that quietly.Knew.The lilt in her voice is the same soft accent that had peeked through Natasha’s English during her first few months at SHIELD. The sound of it is like a knife twisting into his already aching heart. He wonders idly how it can be possible to feel so much love and so much pain simultaneously. He’s felt the ache of her absence every day since Vormir, but never as acutely as today, watching his family gathered around the Christmas tree, his eyes drawn to the empty space in the room no matter how hard he tries to live in the moment, because he knows it’s what she would have wanted him to do.“She has another grave, you know.” Yelena’s gaze is fixed on the nondescript headstone, marked only with the initials NR.And neither holds her body, Clint thinks.“We wanted to remember her here.”Yelena nods one in approval. “She would have wanted that too.”“Why are you here, Yelena?”She doesn’t look up, but her gaze darkens as she stares at the headstone marking her sister’s empty grave. A vacant, transient resting place befitting one who spent her life in the shadows. “I want to meet the people she died for.”“We loved her so much,” Clint says, voice breaking, and it’s an echo of her tearful confession from back in New York when he’d seen her façade crack. “We all did. I need you to know that.”“I know,” she says simply.“Do you want to come inside?”For the first time since she stepped out of the trees, she meets his eyes. The ghost of a smile dances on her lips, and she’s so like Natasha that his heart breaks all over again. “I would like that.”Laura’s starting a second pot of coffee in the kitchen when Clint walks in, tailed by Yelena. Her eyes flick around the house and he knows that in a fraction of a second she’s assessed every potential threat and asset. Her gaze finally comes to rest on the figure beside the tree and she breaks into the first true smile he’s seen.“Kate Bishop.”Kate pauses, mug of coffee halfway to her mouth. “Is this a good thing? Are you here to take me up on that drink I offered?”Yelena’s grin widens as she pulls a flask out of one of her vest pockets. “What do you think?”Clint, about to follow her into the living room, is stopped by Laura’s hand on his arm. “You didn’t tell me there was another stray.” Her tone isn’t accusatory. Laura’s heart is the biggest he’s ever known, and there’s always room for one more. But she wants confirmation of what she’s already guessed, wants him to help her put the pieces together.“I didn’t know she was coming,” he answers honestly.“Is she what kept you in New York so long?”“Among other things.”“Have you told her she can stay?”Clint reaches past her, reaching to the back of the shelf to wrap his fingers around the handle of Natasha’s favourite mug, the one that – out of an unspoken agreement – none of them have touched since her death. “I’m not sure she wants to stay, Laura.”“Nat didn’t, either. Not at first.”“Nat didn’t have anywhere else to go.”“Does she?”I’m going to look for my family, Natasha had told him when he’d called to check in after Steve had come to break them out from the Raft. She’d told him the story later at the compound after she'd brought him back from Tokyo, her voice full of pride as she told him about Yelena and her new mission; to find the Widows hidden all over the world and to tell them that it was finally over, that they were free.Laura meets his eyes with a knowing look as he takes the coffee pot in his other hand and pours the steaming liquid into what he still can’t help but think of as Natasha’s mug. She trails behind him as he re-enters the living room, passing the mug wordlessly over the Yelena, who immediately tops it off with a splash of the liquid from her flask. Noticing Lila watching her with interest she grins, holding out the flask. “You want to try?”Clint clears his throat.Yelena looks up at him, rolling her eyes. “All those years and you really think my sister never gave them vodka when you weren’t looking?” She pours another splash into the mug that Kate holds out in front of her.“She never-” Clint begins, looking to Cooper and Lila for confirmation. Neither of them will meet his eyes. He whips around as Laura bursts into laughter behind him. “Did you know about this?”“Are you really Auntie Nat’s sister,” Nate asks Yelena?She nods once. “I really am.”Five years ago Clint would have been hesitant with her and Kate being so candid around his kids. He knows Laura thinks he’s overprotective, but he’s always wanted to shield them from the world for as long as possible. But now that they’ve literally experienced being snapped out of their very existence in the fabric of the universe only to return inexplicably five years later, he guesses it isn’t too much of a stretch to tell them Natasha has a sister she never told them about. “Prove it,” Nate demands, with all the bravado of a child.But Yelena smiles, reaching into anot
