Chapter Text
Hermione Jean Granger wasn’t considered the brightest witch of her age for no reason. When one Harry James Potter appeared at her parent’s door to see her, she had been anticipating this moment. It did however happen at a much more accelerated rate than she had thought it would.Shuffling for a moment the young man ducked his head, shoulders slumped, with a weary stance, “I’m leaving,” He said finally looking up. Eyes a cloudy green with dark circles under each eye.“Okay” Hermione said simply. She knew that for him do have reached this point, his state of mind was worse than she had anticipated. “Okay?” He blinked, shocked at her easy acceptance, and a bit hurt by it, hunching in a bit more.Letting out a small sigh at the action, she rolled her eyes before grabbing him in a strong hug. Eyes growing misty at the how small and fragile he felt beneath his clothing.“Idiot boy, I knew you needed to get away, I was just waiting for you to realize it…” she said softly, “Come in, we have a ton to get ready”Giving her a small grin that reminded her so much of the even scrawnier 11 year old she had met 6 and a half years ago, Harry followed her into the house. It only took them about 30 minutes to come up with a viable plan, the one small hitch was the fact that he would have to meet with the Goblins at Gringotts. Gathering her purse, Hermione took his arm and they apparated to Diagon Alley.The alley itself was in a state of slight disrepair, with many of the popular shops open once again, but several of the smaller less used shops still closed and damaged. The war had touched seemingly every part of wizarding Britain. People littered the place travelling in groups of at least two, still not relaxed. Upon entering entering the bank, both Hermione and Harry found themselves facing the gaurds and their weapons.“Trespassers and thieves! State your business!” The guard barked angrily.“We wish a meeting with the head of the bank please,” Hermione said clearly holding tight to Harry’s hand, who squeezed it back reassuringly.After two sharp barks of their native language, the goblins led them to the back of the bank, through two large ornate gold and jeweled doors. “Well well…it seems the thieves have returned to the scene of their crime” A slightly older and larger goblin sneered from behind a desk.“We have come to apologize and explain our actions sir,” Harry stated softly drawing all attention to himself.After an assurance that their entire story would remain confidential, the two humans began their tale… An hour later, the goblin was slightly paler, rubbing his temples as though he had a headache. Waiting for his verdict the pair attempted to relax, just as exhausted by the tale.Finally the goblin stood “While I am thankful that such an atrocity against the very universe no longer resides in our bank, as the Head Goblin I must seek some form of reparation for your transgressions,” he finally let out.Both humans tensed at the words, waiting to see what he would ask of them.“In exchange for the damage and the theft, we ask for one galleon a piece from the three of you…” He said, a small shark toothed grin on his face.“Oh thank Merlin!” Harry cried eagerly fishing the three galleons out of the small pouch he carried with him making the Goblins and Hermione laugh.“We are not even and no longer enemies, but while you are here, we must discuss your inheritance Mister Potter.” The goblin said startling them.“inheritance?” Harry asked unsure of what the goblin was speaking of“Yes, it appears that before the Last War, and shortly after the First War several families placed clauses in their wills that should their lines end, all of your monies and property would go to you” The goblin said gravely. Floored at the admission the pair felt as though the entire world had shifted slightly. Such a drastic thought process for so many people that would never see the end of the war. “How much?” Hermione finally croaked out.“As it stood you had a net worth of about 500 hundred thousand British pounds from the Potter inhertance, however, after this you now have roughly a net worth of 35 billion British pounds from the various families that left you in their will, you also have an additional five billion from your inheritance of the Black estate….This does not include the various properties in the value though.” The goblin said carefully, aware of the distress in the young Lord Potter.“I don’t want it…I…its too much, blood money,” Harry cried out, fisting his hair with both hands. “Regardless of want, it is now your estate,” The goblin said factually.Turning and tugging the younger teen close Hermione brushed the tears from his eyes.“Harry, you have an opportunity to do something major in the world right now, I hadn’t brought this up with you before, but there’s something I think you and only you could do…”She said softly.“Wha
