Chapter 1: Harley - Episode One
    




Chapter Text
    They weren’t famous, not in a way that could actually matter. Lower than B list celebrities. They had, maybe, twenty loyal fans combined between the two of them (which was a complete lie, honestly, Harley could hear Abby correcting him in the back of his mind “two million isn’t a small number, Harley Joseph”.) that followed them on multiple social media platforms. They hadn’t declared their inevitable arrival back to New York City to begin recording season three but, well, Harley didn’t know what he should have expected when their studio was literally part of Stark Industries.     The paparazzi were vultures.     “You have literal twigs in your hair.” Abby muttered, her face pinched in a tight scowl and fingers rubbing through her own messy, strawberry blonde waves.     Harley did, in fact, have literal twigs in his hair. “Well why did you have to push me into that bush?” He ducked his head down to see his reflection in the awards cabinet placed by the door to their studio - Listener’s Choice Award 2019, Unmasked season one and then never repeated again - to get a better look at the damage the paparazzi and Abby’s elbows had incurred.     Abby snorted and elbowed him again - they were like knives, pointy and sharp and Abby wielded them with all of the finesse of a girl raised with an older brother unafraid to mess with her. She had to duck considerably less than he did to see her own reflection side by side with his. “Technically,” She hummed, fingers rubbing under her eyes and over the darkening bags Harley knew were from the plane ride (and then direct taxi trip to the studio). “That guy from TMZ stepped on my foot and I stumbled into you and the bush broke your fall.”     He would love it if a bush would break Abby’s fall for once. Ruin her perfect hair and maybe snag a bit on her new bomber jacket. Split it down the back and spill feathers and stuffing everywhere. It would only be fitting, he thought, if she had to deal with it every now and then.     Harley’s vindictive streak was short-lived when Abby winced, though, her ankle twirling in the empty air in front of them. “Did that asshole hurt you?” Harley knew how he sounded - gruff, angry, tight. He was her older brother, her big brother, and years and years of beating up guys that dared mess with Abby Keener meant that he had honed his skills down to a pinpoint. One glare was usually all it took for most guys to leave her alone but, every now and then, one would slip through the cracks. Would dare him to lose his temper.     TMZ guy was only the most recent case.     He would happily punch TMZ guy in the face.     Maybe TMZ guy could be the next one the bush caught. Abby snorted, her green eyes flicking from his face to her slowly rotating ankle. “Chillax, Hulk. I can handle myself.”     She could handle herself. Still, Harley offered her his arm to lean on and Abby took it without complaint. “I really don’t mind punching that guy.”     “Do you even know what that guy looks like?”     “I’m sure he wouldn’t be too hard to find.”     Abby’s fingers curled over his forearm and she squeezed, just enough pressure to assure him that she was fine and that her ankle would survive. Good, Harley thought, Gwen would do much worse to him if he went on a murder spree because of a TMZ reporter. Maybe. She would at least threaten it and, honestly, Gwen could be scary when she wanted to be. “Where’s our welcoming committee?” Abby straightened up, tucked her hair behind her ears and narrowed her gaze around the empty entry way.     It was a good question. Harley had wondered the same thing. Typically, a member of the Stark Industries security team would be waiting for them the moment they stepped out of their taxi to push the vultures away and then pass them off to another in the entryway. But this time there hadn’t been anyone. No Happy Hogan to greet them with his kindest grumpy frown, no Tony Stark loudly announcing their arrival the moment they walked through the doors, not even a Gwen Stacy tapping her foot impatiently against the carpet because they were five minutes late, honestly is the south just not punctual?     Harley didn’t like unusual things.     Sure, he liked poking and prodding and searching for answers as much as the next person, but he didn’t like unusual. The entire staff that he worked with (aside from Abby) seemed to be governed by very specific rules. Happy Hogan followed Tony Stark around like a shadow unless he was told any differently but he did everything with the sort of intensity and focus that Harley admired from a member of a security team. Gwen Stacy was the office cryptid - somehow she had all of the information they needed exactly when they needed it. Harley had never seen her come or leave the studio and was partially convinced that she lived there in some hidden corner he had yet to be given access to explore. Eddie Brock was always later than Harley or Abby, his excuse bei
