Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter was having a really shitty day that Friday. He woke up late, having forgotten to charge his phone the night before after a rather busy evening of patrolling. He felt like he was run over by a truck when he woke up that morning. His panic took over him after a brief minute of him trying remember what day it was. He got out of bed in a jolt. He got ready faster than he ever did. He luckily remembered to pack his suit in his backpack right before he got out. Having already running late the moment he woke up, Peter skipped breakfast (sorry aunt May.) It was friday, and friday meant that he would spend the weekend at the Stark Tower, working on their suits with Tony. Peter loved the weekends just because of that. Tony and May had come to an arrangement a few months ago about Peter’s time spend with Tony. The arrangement was perfect for Peter; aunt May would take most of her shifts in the weekends so that Peter and her would have dinner together at weekdays, during the weekends Peter would be ‘interning’ at the tower. The interning first started off as just a cover story but as time went on and Tony realized that he was actually teaching Peter a thing or two, he put Peter in the SI system as his own personal intern, which was the closest thing to the truth anyway.   Peter got the school ten minutes before the first period ended. He entered the class room with his head down, apologizing to his chemistry teacher. He kept his gaze only on his teacher, too tired to acknowledge Flash’s snickering and others curious looks. He didn’t have to look at them to know it was happening, his Spidey-sense made sure Peter knew that everyone indeed was looking at him from the moment that he knocked on the classroom door. ‘’Look who decided to finally join us! Do you have a good excuse this time Parker? It’s the second time your late to my class this week and frankly I’m running out of patience.’’ Peter’s teacher ridiculed him with a raised eyebrow that wasn’t from curiosity but rather an invitation. His face said to Peter; ‘defy me and see what happens.’ ‘’Sorry sir I didn’t realize that my charger was broken when I plugged my phone last night and my phone died. My alarm didn’t go off.’’ Peter sprinkled a few lies so that he wouldn’t look that irresponsible.  He pulled his phone from his pocket to show his teacher. ‘’You’re off the hook this time as well kid but don’t let there be a third time.’’ His teacher finally gave up.  Peter sighed and took his seat. He didn’t bother taking his notebook out of his backpack since there was only about five minutes left till the bell ringed. Rest of the day wasn’t any better. Flash made even more attempts at making Peter snap and it took every single cell in him to not punch the bully in the face. Normally Peter would be able to tune Flash out by focusing on Ned or if that didn’t work Ned would drag Peter away but Ned had been sick for the past three days and Peter was left alone. His phone was dead too so that meant that he would have no distractions at all. It sucked. His super-hearing didn’t make things any easier either, even if Flash wasn’t directly talking to him, Peter could still hear what Flash said about him behind his back. They were not any nicer than when he was talking shit about Peter to his face.  He knew he could talk to MJ, since they were closer now but Peter was scared that he would embarrass himself in front of his crush. And it wasn’t like they were suddenly BFFs or anything. Sure, MJ was a really smart and cool person, she was smart enough to become the decathlon team’s captain this year and also figure out Peter’s secret identity and nice enough to actually keep it a secret and occasionally put Flash in his place when he pushed his luck. But they still didn’t hang out nearly enough for Peter’s liking, which was probably way too many times. They smiled and waved to each other a few times when they saw each other and sat together in physics, which was the last class of the day. Peter hoped that at least his physics class wouldn’t be that bad, since he and MJ were sitting together. And he was right; it went okay, considering the fact that Peter could do everything that they were learning that year in his sleep.  It was boring, as always, but it wasn’t that bad. They walked to decathlon team’s meeting together afterschool. ‘’Did you bring your permission slip? I’m pretty sure you’re the only one left.’’ MJ finally talked to him when they were walking the now empty school corridor.
Ah, yes, the permission slip. May had made sure to sign and put it securely in Peter’s bag two days ago but Peter was too scared to actually return it. Every time he thought of it, he felt like he was making a huge mistake. It was just a fun little trip with the decathlon team to the Stark Tower, the place where he spent his Friday evenings as well as his weekends, the place where he had his own room. What could go wrong? ‘’I did.’’ Peter nodded his head. Desperate
