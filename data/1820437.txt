Alongside the history of the appearances of soul marks is the history of those who sought to destroy them. In many parts of the world, those who carry the marks were tortured and killed because others didn’t understand the nature of the mark. (See references to Meg O’Halloran.)Throughout history, man has used the mark as a means of torture and subjugation. Pick the name of any oppressed peoples and you will find that their soul marks have been a focal point of some of their oppression: African slaves, the indigenous tribes of North America, the Irish, the Romanii, Jews, and gays, any person or persons thought to be different or deviant.Marks were burned, cut, removed all together, but they always reappeared. Once science was sufficiently advanced enough, man attempted to find ways to chemically suppress the soul mark. None were successful. It wasn’t until the fall of the Soviet Union that it was discovered someone had found a way.Combined with something not of the Earth, Soviet scientists were able to chemically suppress the appearance of the soul mark. This technology was courtesy of a HYDRA offshoot program known as The Red Room.*~*~*~*~He has no name; he is only ‘the asset’. So she insists on calling him Yasha. He doesn’t object; they will be together for a while on this mission and it is better than having to respond to “hey you”. She catches him staring at people as they sit in the café in Minsk, scoping for their target.“You act as if you have never seen them before.” Her comment is light, but her focus is sharp.He knows that she means the names. They are written on people’s arms, hands, wrists, elbows. He doesn’t have one, can’t remember if he ever did. If he pushes there is a vague memory, but it hurts to push, so he leaves it as just that: vague.“What are they?”She looks at him in disbelief. “You don’t know about soul marks?” When he shakes his head, she launches into a lengthy explanation. “I find it sad, Yasha, that you don’t have a mark.”“Don’t need one,” he says gruffly. “Love is for children.”“It is a good thing I am still a child then,” she replies, a twinkle in her eye.He doesn’t say anything. Natalia may look young - fresh faced, wide-eyed, red hair ruffling in the wind - but he knows better. He has seen the files. Because of what they have done to her, she will be youthful for a very long time, the better to accomplish her missions.“You don’t have one,” he states finally. Their target isn’t around, they need to leave soon.“I will when I leave the program, you’ll see. Perhaps it will be your name, your true name.” She smiles at the thought. She believes, like all the other operatives of the Red Room, that her mark will come when she is done with her training, free from the chemical suppressant all operatives are given. He knows this to be untrue. She will never receive a mark. Natalia is different from the others.“Perhaps.” He will indulge her. Once they have found their target and done the job, he will be done with her. He will go back to his masters, his keepers. He looks at Natalia, wondering whose name she might have been given. He doesn’t think it would be his.*~*~*~*~*As the mores and cultures of society changed, so did the nature of the soul marks. More people began to report getting more than one name on their body. Some would come at the same time, some would appear years apart without one disappearing. Same sex names were common, no longer seen as deviant (except by those who were truly adamant in their beliefs). As more became know about transgendered people, they reported that their soul mates would have a name that truly reflected who they were inside, not the name they were given at birth.As humanity moves slowly into the twenty-first century the mark reflects the different kinds of relationships people often form. There have been recent reports of those who have three or more names written on their body, as well as people having platonic soul mates. The anti-soul mark movement continues to grow and thrive, despite these changes. Peggy Carter’s granddaughter, Sharon, now speaks for those who defy the marks, who find love with someone who is not their soul mate.“I have seen things. I know things,” she says. “My grandmother was not wrong. Happiness doesn’t need to come from a name on the skin. It comes from within.”*~*~*~*~*~*The soft sounds of a game in progress wake him. Steve stirs, sitting up in the bed suddenly. He’s not dead. He’s… he ignores the radio, looking down at his wrist. Gone. The names are gone. They’re dead. His heart wrenches in his chest.  He covers his wrist with his other hand, taking a moment to grieve.  It hurts to breathe, like he has his asthma back. It hurts to know that they are gone while he remains.  Slowly, the sound of the game infiltrates his consciousness.  He wrenches his mind free of the grief; he recognizes the play by play. He was at that game. Where is he? Then the door opens and a woman walks in. She sees him and smiles. “Morning,
