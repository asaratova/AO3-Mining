Peter berated himself as he felt a knot forming in his chest. He needed to get over himself, this happened every year! See, Midtown had a long running tradition of career day. On one day every year, students would bring in their family so that they could talk about what they did for a living. Everyone seemed to have someone there with them, whether it be parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles. Everyone except Peter.Two years ago it was Ben, last year it was May. Ben died a few weeks before career day last year and it was just a sad reminder of what Peter and May had lost. May couldn't make it this year, she was swamped with work and had apologized profusely when she learned that she couldn't come. Peter had told her that it was fine, that he didn't really care, but he knew he was a terrible liar.Not even Flash teased him today. Peter grew up with a lot of the kids in his grade, so they knew that Peter’s parents were gone. A lot of them shot him pitying glances as he walked the halls alone. Ned had invited him to hang out with him and his moms, but Peter declined. Ned seemed to get it and just hugged him, leaving him alone. MJ didn't look at him with pity, she just nodded at him in a weird show of support as her own mother stood beside her, telling another parent that it was just her and Michelle now.The schedule for the day was weird, there was a mingling period for the first hour in the cafeteria where the adults could brag about their children to the other rich parents. Then there was a pep rally to show off their school spirit and talk about the students achievements so far in the year. Then everyone was sent to their homeroom class for the next few hours for presentations. Then everyone ate lunch in the cafeteria, after which they could go home early. It's how it went every year.Right now, everyone was heading to homeroom, the pep rally was fine, kinda awkward like they always were, the music played too loud and the yells were generally unenthusiastic. Peter hid in the bathroom for most of the time, pep rallies were always hell on his senses, so he sat in a stall wearing his sound cancelling headphones and playing on his phone. Nobody came looking for him, as he expected, but when a larger amount of people came into the bathroom all at once, he could tell that it was time to leave.Peter slumped in his desk, eyeing everyone that came into the room discreetly. There was a large pile of metal foldable chairs by the door for adults to grab when they came in, allowing them to sit next to their kids. The knot it Peter’s chest grew as kids and adults filed into the room with huge smiles on their faces, he wanted to be bitter that he didn't have anyone like that with him, but he couldn't be. He could never be bitter at May for providing for them.Instead of doing attendance like normal, his teacher, Ms. Hawk, asked everyone to stand when they were called and introduce the adults with them today. Peter zoned out as each kid stood up and talked. Suddenly, “Peter Parker?” Ms. Hawk called. All of the eyes in the room were on him in an instant as he stood up. “Peter, where-?”Peter cut her off before she could say anything. “My parents are dead, by uncle is dead, and my aunt couldn't make it.” Peter quickly stated before sitting back down, looking out of the window so he could ignore everyone's pitying gazes. He spotted a familiar motorcycle in the parking lot and blinked, then there was a knock at the door before anyone in the room could say anything else.The door slowly opened and a head of brown hair stuck into the room. “Hello? I'm here for-"The man was cut off as Peter jumped to his feet and ran to the door. “James!” The young boy yelled.James’ face lit up as he spotted Peter, “Hey kid, sorry I’m late. We had debriefing this morning and Stevie wouldn't stop talking. Got onto Sam and I about being reckless as if he's not the worst of all of us.”The two laughed. “What are you doing here?” Peter asked, looking up at James.He furrowed his eyebrows, “Did May and Tony not tell you? I'm here for career day!” Peter lit up at his words and dragged him over to his desk, snagging a chair from the pile. He unfolded it and pointed at it, inviting James to sit down.Peter looked back at the confused class, a bright smile on his face. It was a stark contrast to the gloom look that was present just minutes before. “Okay, this is James. You guys can call him Bucky. He’s my sorta father figure but also not really, we're kinda just friends. It's weird.”Peter sat back down and smiled at James, who smiled back. Almost everyone called him Bucky, but Tony and Peter only ever called him James. They were also the only ones that were allowed to call him that. Clint once called him James and he ended up with bruised ribs.Many of the woman and girls in the room, as well as some of the men, were eyeing James as they continued the introductions. Peter rolled his eyes when he noticed that many of the married woman were also blatan
