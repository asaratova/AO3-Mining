Chapter 1: I'm So Perplexed
    




Chapter Text
He thought he was hiding it pretty well. That is, until you walked in wearing his henley shirt and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. He didn’t mean to be obvious, but when Steve approached him, he knew he had to tell someone. He was going crazy.“Buck, how long have you had these feelings?” Steve excused himself and took Bucky with him, saying something about training new agents so they could leave.“I- god you won’t let it go will you?” He avoided looking at Steve, knowing very well what he was going to say .“I’m just asking man. I want to make sure you’re good.”“I’m not. I’m really not. She’s- god damn it I don’t even know where to begin. She’s so kind and smart and her laugh is so contagious and I just- I can’t remember when this turned into something more.” Bucky was never one to open up, especially about his emotions, but he just couldn’t stop.“The more I spend time with her, the more I fall in love with her and-”“Did you just say you love her?” Steve stopped walking and grabbed Bucky’s shoulder. “Yes alright. I love her. She means the world to me Stevie and I know she’ll never give me a second glance.”“Why do you say that?” Steve looked like he was about to punch him.“Oh come on you can’t possibly think she’ll ever see me that way. I mean…look at me. I’m a fucking mess. I’m honestly surprised she still even talks to me.” Bucky hit the elevator button aggressively, anger seeping through his stomach the more he thought about you belonging to someone else.“I’d say she does more than talk b-”“What is that supposed to mean?” Bucky pushed Steve’s chest, eyebrows furrowing in anger once more.“I mean, she didn’t go around wearing my shirt when she-”“When she what Steve?” Steve could tell Bucky was getting jealous, maybe even territorial, so he held his hands up in defeat.“You’re not that only one she helped with nightmares man. Few years ago, before you were around, she used to help me through mine too. Stayed over for a couple of weeks at some point until I got better. And before you even say what I think you’ll say, nothing happened I swear. All I’m saying is, not matter how bad it got, she never just borrowed my stuff to wear and she seems to be doing that a lot lately.”“You’re reading too much into it.”“No. I’m not. I shouldn’t be telling you this because it’s none of my business but…she thinks no one hears her but I do. Whenever you’re on a mission, she sometimes walks around and stays in your room for a couple of minutes before going back to hers. I’d say the feelings are mutual pal.”When Bucky said nothing, Steve shook his head and started walking away to the gym.“Just talk to her. You’ll never know until you do.”“Steve I don’t know what I’d do if she rejected me.”“I’m just saying. Take a chance man.” Steve waved goodbye, leaving a very confused and defeated Bucky in the elevator.He needed to clear his head, figure out what he should say to you, if he was even going to mention it. He didn’t want to ruin whatever you guys had going on. Movie nights with you would just be awkward or worse; you’d tell him you can’t spend time with him anymore.Walking into the garage, he took one look at his Harley and decided to go for a ride around the city.By the time he got back, it was later than he anticipated, looking at his watch and dreading the look on your face because you always told him to never be late for movie nights. He parked before quickly making his way through the hallways, stopping in his room to change and fix his hair before padding towards your room.Before he knocked on your door, you swung it open and stared at him, feet tapping on the floor and nose doing that cute little thing when you were pissed.“Doll I am so sorry. I didn’t even look at the time and I got caught up riding around. I brought some ice cream!” He held up the ice cream and gave you that stupid puppy-eyed look. You looked away before grabbing the ice cream and huffing at him.“Just because you’re late, you don’t get to decide what movie we’re watching.”“That’s fine by me sweetheart. I love anything you pick.” You knew what he was doing, trying to get you to loosen up a bit and my god was it working.“We’re starting a new classic today.” You tapped on the bed next to you, clicking play before a wide smile took over your features, the theme of Indiana Jones getting you hyped.“Oh I’ve heard of this.” He laid down next to you, grabbing a spoon before opening his ice cream, and giving you a quizzical look when you shushed him immediately.Halfway through the movie, you scooted closer to him, nuzzling in his arm without giving it much thought. At first, Bucky became a little tense, still uncomfortable with anyone touching his metal arm. But you seemed to relax even more when you sat on his left side, so he said nothing. Once the scene with the snakes came, you squealed and hid your face in his chest, looking through your hand to still keep track of what’s going on.Bucky was losing it. Between
