“Oh baby, yes – just like that. Just like that – keep going, keep going. Oh-““Darcy?”The brunette slapped a hand over her cell phone and motioned urgently at Jane to go away. The little scientist put her hands on her hips and tilted her head expectantly. Darcy motioned harder. Jane sighed and tapped her watch – or at least, where she would have had a watch, had she not misplaced it somewhere – indicating for Darcy to wrap it up. Rolling her eyes, Darcy turned back to the cell phone. --- --- --- --- ---“You know, I don’t actually pay you to make sex calls in the lab, Darce.” Jane said conversationally over lunch. “You don’t pay me at all, Jane,” Darcy answered easily, snagging the last smoked salmon wrap and chewing on it thoughtfully before continuing. “That’s why I have to do it.” She made a kissy face at her boss, screwing up her face comically until the other woman laughed, then relaxing again back into her seat. “Anyway, I don’t make them, I take them.” She pointed out, pouring Jane a glass of pink lemonade before fixing one for herself. She slid the glass over to Jane who accepted it gracefully, then slugged her own back. Smacking her lips and tasting the sugar against her teeth. “Big difference.”Jane looked at her doubtfully over her glass. “I dunno, Darce. It’s still dirty old men breathing at you down the phone and saying-“ She paused, scrunching up her face as she considered the possibilities. “Well, I don’t know what they’re saying, and quite frankly I don’t want to find out.” She shook her shoulders as if chasing the thought away, and Darcy laughed. “It’s not all dirty old men.” Darcy protested, rolling her head back on her shoulders. Jane gave her a look, all arched eyebrow and don’t-give-me-that-crap-Lewis in her serious brown eyes. “Ugh, okay. It’s mainly dirty old men.” They both giggled. “But.” She said, raising a finger and gestured for Jane to quiet. “An important distinction. It’s only talk. Nothing else.”“Darce-““No, listen – it’s like, the perfect job.” Darcy stood up in her enthusiasm, narrowly missing knocking over her half-full glass of lemonade. Jane grabbed at it, laughing, and clutched it to her, protecting her own at the same time. “Number one – no commitment. You know I am not down with the commitment.” She pointed at Jane, who nodded in agreement. “This is the only job you have stuck at, and I am the only non-familial relationship you have that’s lasted longer than six months.” She acknowledged, raising her glass and toasting Darcy as she spoke. “Amen to that, sister.” Darcy bowed her head in return. “Number two – I don’t have to dress up for work.” They both paused at that, and looked over what the brunette intern was wearing. Jeans with rips that hadn’t been there when she’d bought them; patches and stains it would be best no one looked too closely into. Her t-shirt, loose, decorated with bright cartoon cats, dropped from one shoulder and exposed her bra-strap to the world. If she bent over too far at the waist, there was a chance someone looking would also see the rest of her sky-blue bra. Her brunette hair, whilst in some circles could be considered as tumbling across her shoulders was, in more realistic terms, in need of a good shampoo and blow dry. “Hmmmm.” Jane said, and stifled a giggle. Darcy on the other hand, was more than happy to laugh at herself. She shrugged, knocking back more lemonade. “Number three.” She continued, tone serious though the sparkle in her eyes somewhat ruined the effect. “I get to practice my wide and varied range of accents.” Jane nodded in agreement and Darcy spread her arms wide. “That’s so true.” Jane said around a mouthful of hummus and cucumber. “Your Moroccan is second to none.” “I know, right? The Balinese needs a little work but I’m getting there.”The girls dissolved into further giggles. --- --- --- --- ---“Cap, I’m telling you. Everybody does it, nothing to be ashamed of.” Steve looked up from his paperwork blearily and half-registered that Stark was talking to him. In fact, judging by the look on the other man’s face, had been talking to him for some time. “Is that so.” He offered, tone even and hedging his bets. It never did to be too enthusiastic about the things Tony said, even if you’d been listening properly from the beginning. “It’s the purest form of therapy.” Stark sat himself on Steve’s desk, right across the paperwork. Sighing, Steve put his pen down and rubbed a hand over his tired eyes. The mission brief would have to wait, apparently. That or Stark’s ass would suddenly become a much larger feature. “Therapy.” He said flatly. “You want me to go to therapy?” “Not go to therapy.” Stark laughed and clapped a hand on Steve’s shoulder, wincing slightly as the muscle stayed firm underneath his hand. “No one wants to go to therapy, sit in a little circle and listen to other people’s boring little stories. Where’s the fun in that?” Steve shook his head, assuming that som
