OCTOBER 2011
Darcy Lewis sighed as she walked up to her tiny brownstone.It had been a long few days and she was exhausted.She unlocked the door and was greeted by the smell of roasting meat and spices.‘If It Wasn’t for the Nights’ by ABBA was playing on the stereo.She grinned.Well this was a surprise.She hadn’t expected him to home.“Honey I’m home!”Her boyfriend’s head poked out of the kitchen.“You’re home! I thought you were assigned to Dr. Foster for another two weeks.” He said, grinning brightly.“My cover got blown by alien Jesus.” Darcy complained as she collapsed on the couch.Her boyfriend blinked.“Alien Jesus?” He echoed.“Yeah. His name is Thor and apparently the old Norse stories were based on alieums. His dad got mad and banished him to Earth with his magic hammer Mew Mew. I tased him before we helped him stop this magic metal monster from wrecking New Mexico. It was pretty sweet.” Darcy said with a shrug.He boyfriend pulled her into his arms and buried his face in her hair.“Sounds like fun. You smell bad.”Darcy rolled her eyes.“That’s because I just spent two months with an Omega that wasn’t you.” She said as she wrapped her arms around his neck.“I need to take care of that.” He mumbled and Darcy laughed.“Not till you’re done cooking. Nothing to worry about anyways. Jane is a great Omega but she’s not my Omega. You are. Btw what are you fixing?”He laughed.“Ciolan afumat cu fasole.” He said as they entered the kitchen.“Mmm… I love when you talk Romanian to me.”He laughed.“So how was your week shadowing Tony Stark?” She asked.“Pretty cool. Natalia had to reveal her cover pretty quick though. Then we had to babysit. But hey we got to fight a guy with laser whips so that was fun.” He said.“Did you tell him who you were?”“No.”“Did he figure out who you were?” She pressed.He grinned.“Recognized me the minute he saw me. Freaked the fuck out. It was amazing. Natalia filmed it.”Darcy laughed.She’d have to call Natasha later to have her send the video.“So you made a new friend?” She asked.He nodded.“Tony is going to build me a flying car!”Darcy smiled.She didn’t always get why things got him excited but she loved days like this.She leaned forward and kissed him.“My Beta.” He murmured against her lips as he lifted her onto the counter.“My Omega.” She returned in kind.He smiled brightly.“I love you Darcy Lewis.”She grinned.“And I love you Bucky Barnes.”
