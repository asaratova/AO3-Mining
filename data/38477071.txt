Chapter 1: New Beginnings
    




Chapter Text
Tony looks through the window of the Town Car as they approach the large stone archway. The name of the Stark family summer residence – Villa di Dahlia – is written in beautiful curling black iron letters along the arch.This summer it’s just he and his mama, Maria. His father, Howard, decided last minute to remain in the city. “Stark Industries is our legacy, Maria, I can’t keep leaving for months on end. I need to be here to make sure things are taken care of,” he’d said the day before they were meant to leave. Tony doesn’t mind so much. His parents don’t usually spend much time with him anyway. He does, however, wish Jarvis had been able to come with him and Mama. Because Howard chose to stay behind at Stark Mansion in Manhattan, he demanded the family butler, Jarvis, stay with him.This is his last summer before he starts college at MIT. He’s excited, but also nervous. This summer is his last chance to really have fun and be a kid before he starts his journey to receive his Masters in both physics and engineering. Villa di Dahlia is a gorgeous cobblestone house in Upstate New York. It’s settled on 50 acres of land. The area around the house is sprawling with lush green grass and colorful gardens. As the namesake of the house, Dahlias can be seen all over the grounds in rich reds, purples, and black. Peonies are another of Maria’s favorite flowers, the pinks, creams, oranges, and yellows cover much of the surrounding area. Just past the alluring, blooming gardens there’s a dense forest where plenty of wildlife resides. Tony has always felt there is a bit of a magical feel to the forest. If one ventures deep enough, they will find a winding creek with a waterfall about 15 feet high that feeds into a large plunge pool. Along the crest of the waterfall is a large, flat rock that Tony enjoys sunbathing on during the hot summer days and stargazing in the cool nights. “Anthony, I will drop you off and you can take your bags into the house and then I’m going to a small get together at Matilda’s cottage a few miles down the road,” Mama says, “I’ll write her number down for you in case of an emergency.”“Yes, mama,” Tony replies. He wasn’t expecting her to hang around with him all summer. She’s a busy woman. Between all the business parties she’s forced to attend with Howard and her own charity events, she has made many friends who are much more entertaining to be around than he is. They pull up in front of the large, dark wood front door with ornate wrought iron detailing. Tony steps out of the car and waits for Maria to open the trunk so he can grab his bags. As he looks up at the mansion he thinks, ‘I can’t wait to see what this summer has in store for me!’------------“I still can’t believe we found this place! All of this to ourselves, Tasha! This is way too good to be true,” Clint exclaims.“Exactly, Clint. Too good to be true. There’s no way this place is actually empty,” Natasha replies to the overeager boy.Natasha glances around the giant, well-stocked kitchen in the house they had come across just three nights prior. ‘How could no one be here? There’s way too much food for no one to be living here,’ she thinks. The two close friends had stumbled upon the large dwelling on their travels. They’ve never seen such a wonderful place in all their lives. Until last night they’d never even stepped foot inside of a place such as this. When they first found it, they thought for sure there would be giants living there as everything was so very… well, giant. They staked the place out for almost two whole days before they decided to press their luck and enter the abode. No one had entered or exited in the whole time they were observing the area. Still, they were cautious. They had no idea whether the giants would be hostile or not. “Tash! Look at this!” Natasha turns to see what has her friend so excited this time when she sees him sitting on top of a metallic surface, pulling off pieces of a huge, brown… something and stuffing it in his mouth, “I don’t know what this is, Tasha, but you have to try it! It’s so much better than grasshoppers and leaves!” “You idiot,” Natasha scoffs, “you have no idea what that could be! You could be poisoning yourself for all you know.”“Maybe, but what a way to go. This is really good, seriously. I don’t even care what it is.”“C’mon. Before you ingest anymore possible poison. Let’s go check out more of this place. We shouldn’t stay out in the open like this for too long. We don’t know if the giants will be back.”Natasha gestures for Clint to follow her as they descend from the tall, flat surface they had been standing on. As they head in the direction of the next room, they hear a loud noise coming from just outside the house. “You jinxed us, Tash! They’re gonna get us,” Clint yells as they go tearing over to the closest wall and launch themselves into some sort of tunnel with gaps just large enough for them to fit through. “Shut up and run, C
