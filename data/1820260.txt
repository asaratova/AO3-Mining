 “Life will not break your heart. It'll crush it.” 
― Henry Rollins 
 This isn’t a story about searching for your One True Love™.Nor is it a story about finding that aforementioned One True Love™.It isn’t a story about two guys who take almost a century to realise they’re fated to be together.This is more of a story about a commitment-phobic girl and what happens when her supposed True Loves show up uninvited and decidedly unwanted.But we’re getting ahead of ourselves…. …

 If you were to ask Darcy Lewis what she had against soul-mates, you couldn’t count on getting an honest answer.An answer, yes, but not an honest one.  “It wouldn’t be fair to deprive everyone else of the Darcy.” – was one of her favourite ones.  The nonsensical - “They don’t match the rest of the furniture” – also got a fair bit of use. On special occasions, she even threw in a strange ‘Euurggghh….’ noise. That last one always drew confused looks.As Darcy grew older, however, she was humoured far less and humourlessly laughed at far more. The idea of rejecting one’s soul-mate(s) for anything other than the best of reasons, you see, was practically unheard of.…In a bid to distract the public at the height of the Cold War, Soul-mate-Identifying Timers, or S.I.D.s, were introduced. Intended to make the process of identifying one’s True Love™ as easy as possible, S.I.D.s were calibrated using DNA and brainwave patterns recorded at birth and given out on one’s eighteenth birthday.If your soul-mate had yet to reach maturity, the S.I.D.’s digits were blue and read 00:00 until they did.If your mate had already reached maturity, the digits were green and counted down to when you should expect to meet them.The program, initiated by the Japanese government, caught on quickly, with almost every country in the western world starting up some variation of it by the end of the decade, and after it was deemed an almost universal success by the public and authorities alike, it was passed into law that every child was entitled to receive an S.I.D. upon reaching maturity.Those who were past their eighteenth birthday at the time the program started also received S.I.D.s, and divorce rates skyrocketed in the months immediately following its inception.It came as a surprise just how many people had ‘settled’ for what they now deemed ‘second best’.…Bruce Banner, born mere months before the S.I.D. program saw American shores, was the child of two such people – Anna and Brian.  Raised by his loving mother, and subjected to the cruelties of his father, Bruce became a staunch supporter of the S.I.D. movement with a child’s strong belief that the main reason for his father’s abuse was that his parents were simply ‘irreconcilable’. It was a term he’d heard thrown around by the black-and-white figures on the small, staticky television in the Banners’ dull brown living room.It wasn’t until long after his mother’s death that he realised that his parents’ Status had nothing to do with what had happened in that tiny, one-storey house in Jackson, Indiana.…The initiative was an instant hit, injecting hope into the tired shell of the American public by either giving them something to live for or making them appreciate what they already had.  In the months immediately following its inception, ‘I’ve Found My Mate’ parties became a huge thing, and even those who had years to wait before meeting their destined one found themselves with a new purpose, a spring in their step that had been missing for too long, if it had ever been present at all.It didn’t take long for alleged issues with the program to emerge, though.  For hundreds of years, those convicted of homosexuality had tried (in vain) to claim protection under the law established in the Magna Carta by asserting that their partner was their soul-mate. It has since been argued by sociologists that The Powers That Be had hoped to eradicate the claim that homosexuality was anything more than an abomination, proving once and for all that one’s soul-mate would always be of the opposite gender – As God Intended®.What the authorities hadn’t counted on, however, was the S.I.D. program providing scientifically definitive proof that homosexuality was more than just a ‘passing phase’, or as was commonly believed at the time, a pestilent oddity.They also hadn’t considered the possibility that some people would have more than one soul-mate.By the end of the year,  over twenty thousand people had come forward as being either newly bi-sexual or gay, with as many claiming that they had multiple soul-mates (sometimes as many as three or four).By the end of the following year, the right to marry someone of the same sex and the right to marry more than one person were made human rights.…While most of the other children at St Agnes ached to be taken home by the assortment of well-dressed people who visited the home on a monthly basis, Skye No-Las
