Chapter 1





Chapter Text
There is a crack in the stone. It’s a small hole, and so far above his head into the flat wall, if he tried to climb for it he would undoubtedly fall. It emits a bleak ray of daylight from the outside: a promise of freedom.And yet here, in this damp, dark hell, there is no such thing as promise.Whiter and more translucent than the light itself is Loki’s bare form, battered from his injuries as Asgard’s prisoner. The dried wounds along his sides split with the movement of his breathing, bleeding anew. He stares into that crack with dehydrated eyes, peering from the inside of the dark jail cell. If he was still his younger self – clinging to the hope and expectations that poisoned the truth of his existence – he ponders if he would feel longing; if he would still receive some self-gratification believing he could belong to something – could share in a collective power – could give himself purpose. If he still had faith in that way of life, he thinks he would turn his head unto that ray of light and see a superficial glimpse of hope.But in this state of being, here and now, he sees the truth very clearly. A mockery of his existence. A lie.He tears his gaze away from it, the rough tugging of shackles around his wrists a pleasurable reminder of true pain – a physical distraction from the reality he can’t escape. He leans into the coarse stone against his back, uncomfortably cold if not for his Jotun blood.All is silent.He is alone with the sound of his breath.
