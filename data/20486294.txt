Chapter 1: "Small, Tiny and in an Underoos Onsie"
    




Chapter Text
Peter wasn’t exactly prepared for when the Ironman and Captain America feud came into Queens; honestly, how cool was this?!?!? He got to see his heroes up close and personal! Even if it was because said heroes were dragging their fight, as in war, across Queens. And Peter was about thirty seconds away from jumping into the middle. And he would most likely die from doing so.Systematics, really...“Earth to web head, focus.” Came MJ’s cool voice to his earpiece. “Guy in the Chair, how long for audio feed?”“ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh- IT’S IRONMAN AND CAPTAIN AMERICA!” Ned’s voice squealed from the radio piece. “IT’S OFFICIAL, I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN. I’M LITERALLY DEAD.”
“Yeah, and unless you want Web head to actually die and for me to bury you alongside him, set up the audio feed.”
“Buzz kill,” both boys murmured under their breaths without any actually heat behind it. Leave it to MJ to make sure they kept alive. “From here on out, we will use our code names, stay as professional as possible- leave nothing that can be traced backed to us; interests, tidbits, any particular references either. Once we’re able to listen to them, they can listen back. Guy in the Chair, how much longer until we’re live?” MJ's voice came out crystal clear over their radios. “T minus 15 seconds.”
“Oh, and Web head? Make sure you ask Ironman if he believes in climate change when you get close enough.”

“We are going live in 3…2…1” 
Peter couldn’t help but feel giddy at how cool everyone sounded. Ned's aka, Guy in Chair, voice was cool and calm; MJ, aka Black Dahlia (the joke came after she told them that she didn’t care if Star Wars made a remake or not. They has cried tears as if their hopes and dreams were murdered. [Nothing at all to do with the fact they find her as mysterious, and lethal as the case itself]) had Spiderman’s back- his back.It was like having his very own super team.HOW FREAKING COOL WAS THAT!

Tony hated that they were fighting over civilian territory, but he only had sixteen hours to bring the Rogue Avengers back. He doubted that Steve would just give in anytime soon.
‘Sir, your suit has been infiltrated by an unknown source’. Chimed Jarvis.
Are you kidding me? Tony just couldn’t get a break. How the heck did anyone on Caps team hack his AI?Humming to himself, he instructed the AI to do a thorough back door check on the intrusion and to seal the break in. Tony wasn’t prepared for his AI to come back empty handed, stating there wasn’t any back doors to trace, but they could hack back into the intruder’s system.This couldn’t be Cap, could it? Maybe Sam or Clint? Sam has the experience, and Clint is smart and easy to underestimate. “Hey, honey bear, do an algorithm diagnostic for back door entry.” Tony hoped that whatever they did, it didn’t affect Rhodes. He didn’t think he could handle having him injured because of him. He wouldn’t be able to bare it.“The suit has been compromised, Tones. What do you think we should do?” the Colonel's voice filtered through the line.They only had sixteen hours to bring the Rogues in, but to war with Cap with compromised suits? That would be suicide, but he doubts that Ross would care to listen to that. “We’ll proceed for now. The moment the suits aren’t functioning optimally, we stand down.”.“Hey, my suits been jacked!” Sam called over the communications line. “How the heck did Stark manage to do that?”Cap knew that fighting Stark was going to be difficult, but the last time he met the man he didn’t think he would be able to hack in Sam's suit. Scott was also probably ‘jacked’ as well. This wasn’t going to end well if both Scott and Sam were down. He needed to save Bucky, but how could he sacrifice the others for this? There had to be a way to save his team and not compromise Bucky. Maybe if he just took Stark out for a bit and then they could get away. It was worth a try.“Stand down until further notice, Sam- you, too, Scott. I’ll go after Tony. Once he’s down, then you can enter the battle only after that. Try to figure out what’s wrong, okay?”Both men affirmed the new plan as they landed and promptly turned their suits offline and on to battery mode. They could never be too careful..Tony knew something was probably wrong when both Sam and Scott went down. Something was definitely wrong when Cap turned his full attention to him and charged.Well, well. Tony would be lying to say he wasn’t itching for a rematch from Serbia.He activated his turbos and jets as he charged forward. He wasn’t going to lose to a frozen grandpa. This time, he didn’t have his murderous fugitive friend to help him..Cap and Tony were just about to enter a ten feet radius of each other when a new voice squealed on their head coms.
“This is so freaking cool! Tell me you’re seeing this! This is freaking Ironman and Captain America! I’m literally dead!” 
The voice sound young and unfamiliar as another joined them.
“Dude get me an aut
