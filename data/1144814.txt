As Steve passed by Tony’s room on the way back from a  particularly grueling trailing session in which both Thor and the Hulk had come  out looking much better than he had, Steve paused. The sounds coming from  within made him wince in sympathy. Either Tony had had one too many drinks—which  didn’t seem likely as it was three in the afternoon—or the man was sick. Steve  stuck his head in through the open doorway and directed his call toward the  ensuite bathroom. “Hey, Tony. You all right in there?” The door was half open and a groan sounded from behind  it. “Go away.” Steve decided that wasn’t an official order and chose to  not follow it. He made his way through the bedroom. Usually neat and tidy, the  covers on the bed were rumpled, askew, and clothing littered the floor in a  three-foot radius around the bed. There was an obvious trail from bed to  bathroom where clothing wasn’t, leading to a Tony Stark curled around a toilet  bowl. His cheek against the cool seat, Tony’s head stayed put but his eyes  flicked upward to see Steve. “What’s wrong?” Steve asked, suddenly feeling awkward in  the doorway. If he thought Tony were sick, he should have called for Bruce  already. “Hangover? Food poisoning? Flu?”

Tony lifted his hand, pointing uncoordinatedly in Steve’s  general direction. His words were weak, slightly slurred, as if he had no  energy left. “That last one.” He suppressed a burp and his eyes flicked briefly  toward the toilet then back to Steve. “Go before you catch it from me.” His  whole body shuddered at this, as if it didn’t like the idea. And he pulled his  arm back to wrap it around his middle. All he wore were baggy sweatpants and a  short-sleeved white t-shirt. Steve almost wished his new Captain America outfit had a  cape, so he could wrap it around the man’s shoulders. And he could have gone  back into the bedroom for a blanket, sure. But instead he immediately sat down,  folding his body against Tony’s, and wrapped an arm around Tony. His other hand  tested for fever, feeling first Tony’s forehead then cheek. Expecting Tony to resist, Steve was shocked when Tony  leaned into the touch, as if the temperature of Steve’s hand felt good against  his burning hot forehead and he suddenly couldn’t get close enough to the man.  Steve wrapped both arms around him and cuddled the man close. Tony pulled away  from the toilet and buried himself against Steve’s front, hugging both his arms  to his chest, bringing his knees up toward his chest as well, and letting Steve  just hold him. It wasn’t the most comfortable of positions, sitting on  the cold tile floor in the middle of Tony’s bathroom, but this was a side of  Tony he’d never seen. The man barely shook hands, unless he was making a  business deal. But now he clung to Steve’s uniform, as if scared Steve would  pull away, taking his warmth with him. So Steve sat there and held on for as  long as Tony wanted. Even when Tony fell asleep sitting up against him and woke  with an embarrassing start, Steve didn’t say anything. He just rubbed Tony’s  back until Tony drifted off again, his hot cheek against Steve’s chest. Steve was pretty sure the others were never going to  believe this.*“I’ll be happy when we finish the rebuild of your lab,”  Tony said, reaching past Bruce to grab a tablet off the desk that he could load  up with the new suit specs he’d been working all week on. Bruce made a noise of agreement, eyes fixed on whatever  slide he’d loaded into his microscope. Tony’s lab was bigger than almost  anywhere else Bruce had ever worked, but even he had to admit that it was a  little cramped with two of them in there. Mostly, that was because Tony liked  his space and didn’t like anyone touching his toys. Bruce had been squeezed  into a corner, and even then Tony kept things on his desk. Well, two could play  at that game. Pretending his pen was out of ink, Bruce wheeled his  chair toward Tony. Instead of reaching in front, he reached around behind the  man, helping himself to a pen from the cup there. Tony almost never bothered to  write things out the old school way, but he still had the pens there as if they’d  come with the desk. Bruce’s hand grazed the curve of Tony’s back and his arm  pressed there, lingering as Bruce found a pen he liked. The side of his body  pressed against Tony’s and he turned his head to get a look at the cup, finding  Tony staring right into his. Tony didn’t look annoyed or even curious. He had a  distant look in his eyes, which closed slowly, almost timidly. Then his body  leaned to the side, heavy against Bruce’s. It was as though they were each running their own  experiment, trying to determine the proper length of time, amount of weight to  apply, how close their heads could get, how each would react upon feeling the  other’s breath against his skin. Bruce rubbed his hand, pen gripped between two  fingers, up and down Tony’s upper arm. And Tony tilted his head, fitting it  into the space between Bruce’
