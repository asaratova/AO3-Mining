Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Tony Stark knew that he was a lot of things. He was a billionaire, a superhero, and very pissed off that he had to wait in line for his coffee. He never had to wait in line before. Gawkers were looking and paparazzi was swirling all around him trying to get pictures. He really wished he’d listened to Pepper and just got another assistant. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw a little boy with circular blue glasses that were latched tightly to his head. The little boy was looking curiously around as his legs kicked beneath the chair he was sitting on reading the Science Today Magazine. Tony wasn’t sure what happened, but soon people were running in the street and out of the shop. Shrugging his shoulders he walked over the booth where the kid was sitting and sat down. The science magazine was laying flat on the table in front of him as his little eyes poured over the page. "Well hello there," Tony said. The boy’s head shot up in a daze. Tony smiled as his big brown eyes were wide as saucers behind the glasses.“Y-you’re Iron Man!” “I am and who are you?”“I-I’m Peter. N-nice to meet you, sir,” the boy said still in awe. “So Peter, you’re uh sitting here all by yourself. Is there someone you’re waiting for?”  The boy shrugged. “My uh Karen, she’s working right now. I can’t be there when she’s gone.” “Why not?” Peter looked around as if he was looking for someone. “Mr. Jeff, he uh likes it better if I’m outside during the day,” the boy said quietly. “He wants me to play ball n stuff.” “Ball, huh?” The boy nodded. “He signed me up for baseball this time.” “Do you like it?” Peter shook his head. “I’m not real good.” He laughed to himself. “I suck.”“You can’t be that bad,” Tony said kinda smitten by the adorable kid. Out of his pocket, the small boy showed him an inhaler.“I got it bad. With the grass ‘n stuff, it’s hard to do much running.” “Did you tell uh what’d you say, Mr. Jeff or Ms. Karen?” “Ms. Karen knows but Mr. Jeff makes the rules so she says I gotta do what he says.”“Why?” The boy shrugged. “Grownup stuff I guess,” Peter said. “Well, what do you mom and dad say?” Tony noticed the boy stiffen visibly. “I don’t got none,” he said quietly. “Oh kid, I’m sorry,” Tony said.“Well, I had some, but my uh they died.” Tony nodded.“My parents died too.” The boy perked up.“So you’re like me? I didn’t know that.” “I am, I was older than you when I lost them, but yeah kid we’re the same.” Peter smiled widely at Tony. “I can’t believe I get to sit here with Iron Man. Wait til the other kids here about this!”“Other kids?” Peter nodded.“Mr. Jeff and Ms. Karen gots two other kids right now. I’m the youngest.” Tony nodded.“Are they nice to you?” Peter shrugged again. Tony noticed how baggy the kid’s clothes were on him. “Them other kids?” Tony nodded. “Sometimes. The other day Kyle let me play on the Switch. Nigel he uh he doesn’t like me much.” “Are they like us?”“Without mommies and daddies?” Tony nodded. “Yeah, but I think Mr. Jeff and Ms. Karen are gonna keep them. They’re going to court next week. They’re real brothers and they’re good at sports. Nigel is thirteen and he plays on the high school basketball team. Kyle is eleven and he’s 'n um throwy guy in football.” Tony smiled this kid was in far over his head. “Well, what does Peter like?” The boy’s face lit up completely.“Nobody’s asked me that before! I like science! Like a whole lot! I read all the books in my class and the teacher lets me stay inside during recess and watch more movies about science! I know almost the entire periodic table! I like Legos too! I can build almost anything if I see it!” “That’s great!” Peter continued to ramble on and Tony couldn’t keep the smile off his face. After Siberia, things in his world had changed suddenly. It felt like his whole world was shifting into the darkness around him, but right here in this moment, this kid was a light.________________________________After letting the kid eat his fill on pastries, milk, and a sandwich Tony stood up. “I guess it’s time to go, bud. I’ve got to get back to my work now.” Peter nodded, but Tony saw the disappointment cross his face. “It was real nice talking to you Mr. Stark,” the boy said. “This is the best day ever!” Tony ruffled the boy’s curls and started to walk out the door. He almost made it before he turned back around. He walked over to where the boy was sitting once again. “Peter, what time is Ms. Karen gonna be home?” “Uh, 3 in the afternoon.” “Do you think she’ll mind if you come to my lab with me?” Peter’s eyes grew wide. “Really?” Tony smiled. “I don’t think she’ll mind! I need to call her and tell her. Is that ok?” Tony smiled. This kid was too precious.________________________________After working in the lab all afternoon Peter looked like he was ready to drop. Tony couldn’t keep the smile off his face. He was amazed by the boy’s ability to retain and understand what he was teaching him.“Pete let’s get you back down to the diner,” Tony said.
