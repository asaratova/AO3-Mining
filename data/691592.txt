Chapter 1





Chapter Text
.The clothes were red.They were the Ceremonial red of Tony’s Family and Company, which was what he was used to and what made this all a little bit easier for him with it's familiarity, but the scattered gold on it’s neck, sleeves and hemline that were Asgard sigils were what made him so nervous.Tony ran his fingers over it, staring as it was draped over his bed for him to wear. It was longer than most clothes that he wore, almost like a dress, and he supposed that that was the point. It was a marriage after all, he needed to look his ‘best’.He barely noticed when the servant left the strings on his back untied, didn’t even look up when he heard the door open and close, but he did jerk in surprise when he felt rougher hands clutch at his arms.“I hate these kind of ceremonies,” He murmured softly, wincing when Howard’s fingers tighten the strings on his back for him, clasping and pulling until he could hardly breathe.“Well the clothes suit you.” Tony closed his eyes, feeling hot tears of hatred burn behind the lids.“Don’t,” He said sharply, pulling away when Howard was done and pushing the rest of the robe down over his bare legs, “Don’t try and make this sound better on your own conscience just because - "“Don’t start this again, Anthony,” Howard sighed, rubbing at his forehead but at least he wasn’t shouting back. At least he wasn’t screaming in Tony’s face like he had the first time Tony'd heard about this.The first time that Tony had heard about his own marriage.“We’ve discussed this all far too many times already, and I would really rather you just get ready now, instead of working yourself up again.”Tony’s chest rose as he struggled to hold back the anger in him but he let it go eventually, because why argue now? This could likely be the last time he'd ever see his father again, and while he hated him right now, he knew he’d regret leaving him like this.“Well it’s not fair,” He said instead, ignoring how childish he sounded because why shouldn’t he be allowed to act out about this. His fingers continued to run over the silk of his clothes, but they tightened when he remembered what they meant, ”None of this is fair! Just because I have this - 'gene' or something, it doesn’t mean people can just exploit that and -““That is not what is happening here.” Howard interrupted him firmly, looking over the bed at the rest of the accessories that the servant had laid out already for them, “I’ve explained that to you.”“Yeah, and it ends up sounding a lot more like exploiting each time you say it,” Tony turned away from him, reaching for the hairbrush on the bedside table, but his hand strayed past it and he opted for the comb instead.He felt pressed like a doll already but he’d be damned if he went out looking rumpled and as worn out as he felt, “You’ve told me. All my life you’ve told me. You’ve said to hide this part of myself, to never let anyone use it against me and now you’re the one who's using it against me. And whenever I try to argue about it you turn it all back onto me instead. Like it's all my fault I was born this way,”The comb caught on the knots in his hair when he yanked down, but when Howard tried to take it from him he refused to let go, “And it’s not fair.”“Nothing's fair in life, Anthony, you should know that by now,” Howard grabbed the hairbrush when Tony still refused to let go of the comb, and he raked it down over Tony’s hair, smoothing it from where it had risen in his sleep,“But as a carrier, and as my son, you know how important it is that you do this. With this gene, you can't reproduce unless you're with another male, and with the politics of our country, you know I’d rather not let the company - "“You’d rather, what about - ow,” Tony pulled away when Howard pressed down harder than necessary on his head, and he took the brush from him to take over.“There's more at stake here than just your pride Anthony,” Howard glared at him, and Tony sat on the edge of the bed, brushing his hair as he looked down at his lap, “Having an heir is one of the most important things you can do for the company and for me, and with you having been born a Carrier, of all things, it’s almost impossible for you to manage even that,”Tony closed his eyes at Howard’s bitter disappointment and turned his face away.“When Nick mentioned his father - Jack’s - archive on inter-dimensional worlds, of course I joined in with all the research. And now, not only have we made contact with them on numerous occasions, but - "“But we’ve all agreed on a pact, to keep both worlds allied,” Tony finished for him, his voice low and flat, “I know this, you bragged about it constantly to me, I just didn’t think that it’d affect me in the long run.”“Don’t be dense, Anthony, of course it’d affect you. It affects everyone in one way or another, and this is one of the better circumstances, believe me - "“How,” Tony stood, letting the brush fall and bounce at his feet on the floor, “is this better?” He ignored
