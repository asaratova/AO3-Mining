Orders from the Director
To be honest the Ex-Vengers probably had their heads a little too far up their asses to realize nothing was going to be simple.After the Raft Escape, Steve led his group back to Wakanda. There they were met with Natasha coming to seek shelter from the storm. Everyone was sure when the said storm this caused died down they could go back with no problem. They should have realized it was only their leader that felt this way. For some reason or another, even the seasoned members of the group fell victim to his belief. It was not to be.T’Challa had told them there had been a situation and that they were free to go back to the New SHIELD HQ. At first, they thought they were in the clear. The young king shot that down really quickly saying that he didn’t know the details but that SHIELD knew they were in Wakanda and unless he wanted not only an upset country but an upset world, he would return the Ex-Vengers back to SHIELD, there was some sort of emergency. The way he worded it made it seem that he was even unsure of the detail but SHIELD confirmed the rogues would not be going to prison. There was that at least.With Wakanda coming out of isolation like it has if there was anything to cause trouble with this transition it would be the rest of the world finding out he was hiding fugitives. Not only that, he was threatened with economic collapse as well…with the world than against them, Wakanda would lose some of their valuable contracts. Not even Vibrainium would be able to help out their country if that was the case. Saying that he would see them there before returning to his own country, T’Challa gave them time to prepare. They had entertained the thought of trying to flee but with the Dora’s…there was more a chance they would leave in body bags.The flight there was nothing to write home about. Well, unless you accounted for the tenseness of the situation. There was something about the whole ordeal that made them all uneasy. One thing that they thought about was if they could explain their side, it might not be as bad as they were all thinking. Looking at it that way, made them feel a little bit better. There had to be a few people in the ranks that would sympathize with their plight.When they landed, the whole group was escorted to the New SHIELD building in black unassuming vehicles, T’Challa and his guards included. The rogues were asked to leave their belongings in a locker that would be locked. Their stuff would be safe in there. So they did. Not happily but right now if they showed some compliance it may be what they need if they end up in a tight spot. Showing they were willing to listen may help in the long run. Why they only thought of this now was surprising for many.It was then they were lead one room that was odd. It looked like an observation room but they were on the side of the glass that could be seen through. It also took up the entire wall and on the other side there was a small table but was big enough for 6 chairs to comfortably sit around. They were in a part that didn’t have anything to sit on, leaving them standing. That was kinda rude to do to guests but maybe there was a good reason for it.Still, it was odd and had them all thinking but then someone who they never thought they would never see again. Turning their attention to the door they saw…“Phil…” Clint said with a small smile on his face. A smile that was not returned by the man they had thought was dead.“That is Director Coulson,” Phil replied swiftly with a cold tone. The tone he had made the spy twins recoil a bit. That was not a tone they were used to hearing. It was clear that the man didn’t want to be there but why? He had been their handler and was supposed to be dead…then again, so was Fury but that didn’t stop him. T’Challa had also picked up on the behavior as his bodyguards moved closer to his side.“Of course, Director, are we here to help you somehow?” Steve asked. After all…there was some sort of emergency. He thought it was a good thing that Phil was Director or SHIELD now. Phil was his biggest fan, so of course, he would listen to Steve. With Phil on their side, they would surely have a better start at beating the Accords.“No, I am here to reign you in. You didn’t want to sign the Accords and committed several felonies in the process of your retaliation. So simply, you aren’t fit for hero duty. Yet, they will admit you have skills that may be useful in the future. The solution was to bring you here.”“The Accords would have tied our hands,” Steve complained hoping to find compassion in Phil, “We would have been at the beck and call of the government. We shouldn’t need a piece of paper to save people.”“You had no problem with SHIELD doing the same,” countered Coulson, “The funny thing is the UN isn’t even a government but SHIELD was part of the US government. Given that fact your argument is invalid. Now, I have had to pull a good few strings but you work for SHIELD once more and will
