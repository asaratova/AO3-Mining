"Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?" asked James.
The small crowd cheered again, and with a swish of James' wand, Snape's pants flew up to his knobby knees, leaving him exposed as he frantically tried to cover himself with his hands.
Lupin, who finally looked up at that, seemed to go pale. He quickly shut his book and shoved it into his bag.
"Where are you going, Moony?" asked Sirius, still laughing.
Lupin muttered an excuse Harry failed to hear, and as Snape fell to the ground again, struggling to wrap his robes around himself and pull his pants up, the memory swirled.
Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colours until his surroundings solidified. He now stood on a hilltop, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. Snape was there, but he looked older now. He was panting hard, dropped to his knees in front of Albus Dumbledore.
"I—I come with a warning—no, a request—please—"
"What request could a Death Eater make of me?"
"The—the prophecy... the prediction... Trelawney..."
"Ah, yes," said Dumbledore. "How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?"
"Everything—everything I heard!" said Snape. "That is why—it is for that reason—he thinks it means Lily Evans!"
"The prophecy did not refer to a woman," said Dumbledore. "It spoke of a boy born at the end of July—"
"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down—kill them all—"
"If she means so much to you," said Dumbledore, "surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?"
"I have—I have asked him—"
"You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. "You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?" 
"Hide them all, then," Snape pleaded. "Keep her—them—safe. Please."
The hilltop faded, and suddenly Harry stood in Dumbledore's office instead. 
Snape was slumped forward in a chair, and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim.
"Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and colour of Lily Evans's eyes, I am sure?"
"DON'T!" bellowed Snape. "Gone… dead…"
"Is this remorse, Severus?"
"I wish... I wish I were dead..."
"And what use would that be to anyone?" said Dumbledore coldly. "If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear."
Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore's words appeared to take a long time to reach him.
"What—what do you mean?"
"You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily's son."
"He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone—"
"The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does."
There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself. At last, he said, "Very well. Very well. But never—never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear... especially Potter's son... I want your word!"
"My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?" Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape's ferocious, anguished face. "If you insist..."
Harry felt himself rise into the air as the office's walls evaporated around him; he quickly floated through icy blackness and then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon.
Almost unconsciously, he took several steps back until he felt his back crash against the wall. He glared at the Pensieve as though everything he had just witnessed was going to jump out of it and devour him.
The door opened and Snape stormed in, walking past Harry to his desk without so much as looking at him. "I told you we shall resume tomorrow, Potter, you may leave."
When Harry didn't answer, Snape opened his mouth to say something, but didn't. Harry continued to glare over at the Pensieve, shock stricken and absolutely still, and Snape followed his gaze carefully.
His voice was a dangerous whisper when he talked, barely audible. "What did you do?" He looked aghast; his lips were shaking, his face was white. "What did you do, Potter?"
Harry swallowed, feeling his own legs shake. "What was that prophecy about?"
Snape launched himself on Harry and grasped his arm, shaking him savagely. "Oh, you couldn't resist, could you, you little—"
"Answer me!" screamed Harry, trying to free his arm. "It was your fault Voldemort killed my parents, wasn't it?" His heart was beating fast, and darkness had filled his chest, cutting his breath short.
Snape grabbed him by the throat and squeezed, throwing him from him with all his might. Harry fell hard onto the dungeon floor and grunted. 
"What did you see?" Snape hissed, his eyes glistening with a madness Harry had never seen before.
"Everything," spat Harry, a million thoughts racing in his mind. "You led Voldemort to my parents—he found them bec
