Chapter 1





Chapter Text
People say that little girls grow up and marry someone just like their fathers. Darcy never really believed in any of that, because, well, her father wasn’t anyone’s role model. She can’t remember a time when he acted like a father should. That duty fell to her uncles. Grant was only seven when she was born, and Kevin was only five. They were, in many ways, more like siblings than anything else.Her grandparents had died when her father, Jackson,  was 18, and he took custody of Grant and Kevin, as they had no other living relatives. She came along two years later. She wasn’t exactly planned, her mother had just shown up with her one day, and that was that. Grant told her that in those first few years they were an unconventional, if happy, family. She has no memory of it. She was just a baby, and the boys were sort of fascinated, and sort of disgusted by her at the same time. She cried all the time, and didn’t really start becoming interesting to them until she started trying to crawl. Then, she would follow her brothers around everywhere, much to their chagrin. She constantly was pulling at them to have them carry her around, and hated to be left behind. They begin to pray for her to learn how to walk. Of course, when she did, they wished she could forget how. She had two speeds: break-neck fast, and sleeping. She ran everywhere. Her first word was “ant!”, and no matter how Grant tried, it was another six months before she could even begin to attempt to pronounce his name properly. Her second word, was “‘evin”, and her third was “up”. She came by the nickname Monkey naturally - her favorite place to be was perched on her brother’s backs or in their arms. When Darcy was three, Jackson lost his job at the factory. He tried to find another job, but they were scarce for a 23 year old with 3 kids and no more than a high-school education. Her mom, who hardly came by to see her to begin with, disappeared altogether. That’s when things started to get rough. He started drinking. He found a part time job, and things got a bit better. Money was tight, but they made do. Then the part-time job ran out, but the beer runs didn’t. It became a cycle -he’d get part time work, hold that down for a while, and then would lose that job. He started drinking more. Then he’d get another job, lose it, and drink some more. Grant had always been her and Kevin’s unofficial babysitters, but slowly, he became their primary caregiver. Jackson just stopped caring, about anything.It was Grant who started to make sure the bills were paid after a disastrous winter where they cut off the electricity and they had no heat in January. Grant was the one who made sure that Kevin had his homework done, and asked old Mrs. Dugan in the apartment next door to watch Darcy when they were in school.  He taught himself to cook, because Jackson either wasn’t there, or was too drunk to do so. With all the resilience of childhood, Grant and Kevin bonded together, and thought that things would get better. They didn’t. Her very first memory was of the first time Grant got hit. Jackson was too drunk to make dinner that night, so Grant did. Darcy doesn’t remember exactly what happened, a vague memory of wanting Grant’s attention, trying to grab something she shouldn’t have, and Grant having to rescue her from her own mess. She’d distracted him, and he burnt dinner, almost to the point of making it inedible. Her dad was furious, yelling at Grant, and backhanded him across the face. He went to bed that night hungry and with a black eye and split lip as she and Kevin cried in his arms.After that first time, Grant, who was sometimes more nimble than a cat, got a reputation for being more clumsy than she was. And her reputation was such that if there was a loose step or a mud puddle in a two mile radius, she’d be the one to find it and scrape her knee or muddy her clothes. Grant took the abuse, terrified that if he told anyone, they’d be taken away by child services, never to see each other again. He wore long sleeves, and blamed bruises on being clumsy or rough-housing with Kevin. Kevin always, always, backed his brother, just as scared to be taken away.When Grant was thirteen, Kevin couldn’t take the abuse anymore. He tried to stop Jackson, tried to intervene, shoving Darcy into a safe place in their room. The moment that Kevin’s arm was broken and his ribs were bruised changed the family dynamic forever.   Grant signed up for defense lessons, using money from his paper route, and started hitting back. It didn’t change overnight. More often than not, Grant got bruises for his trouble, and Kevin still didn’t let him face him alone. Eventually, the abuse stopped. Apparently a target who hit back didn’t appeal much.Jackson, who hadn’t been around much to begin with, was around even less, preferring to spend his time getting kicked out of bars than raising children. When Darcy started Kindergarten, Grant skipped class to walk her to Mrs. Dugan’
