"I'm afraid Mr Stark isn't here at present, Colonel."Rhodey glanced around the empty living room of Tony's Malibu house. Tony's places tended to be a bit spartan anyway outside of certain areas (bedrooms, workshops, offices), but even accounting for that, the house was too empty and too dead for anyone to be in residence. It was just the feeling, the way you knew an ambush was coming. The creep in the spine that told you whether a place was empty or not.Not that he needed it. Rhodey knew exactly where Tony was. In New York, with Pepper, working on the construction of Stark Tower. That was sort of the point."Yeah," he said, not bothering to crane his head in search of the voice. Moving to the sofa instead, sitting down gingerly on the edge and dropping his jacket beside him. "I know, JARVIS. I'm actually here to talk to you."There was a pause, during which Rhodey guessed JARVIS was either just processing in startlement, or having a small panic attack. One or the other. "... Sir?" the AI asked, eventually. Extremely cautiously, which had a tiny smile flitting over Rhodey's face. You could tell, you could honestly tell, sometimes, that JARVIS had been raised by Tony. People dropping by specifically to talk to him were grounds for panic pretty much every time."Relax," Rhodey waved a hand, grinning faintly. "Nothing serious." Then he paused, and thought about it. "At least, not ... It's serious to me. Not necessarily to you. Okay?"... No. JARVIS didn't say it, but Rhodey heard it. If you sort of smushed Tony and Pepper together in your head (and wow, wasn't that a surprisingly scary thought), you could actually approximate a lot of what JARVIS didn't say."If you say so, sir," was what he actually said, in a tone so perfectly dubious that it might actually be the dictionary definition. Then: "Do you require assistance, sir? Many of my fabrication facilities have been moved to New York, but I can improvise if it's an emergency ...?"Rhodey shook his head, his smile drifting towards lopsided. Yeah. He'd bet. And JARVIS would do it, too. Tony's AIs, much like Tony himself, would diss you up one side and down the other, but push came to shove, they'd also pull shit out of their asses to help you when you needed it. They had definitely been raised by Tony Stark. And that was ... sort of the problem, really."I just wanted to talk to you," he said, quietly, and spent a couple of seconds listened to an AI have a perfectly silent panic attack. "About the palladium poisoning. About Tony. Okay?"JARVIS didn't answer. Rhodey really, really hoped that wasn't because the AI was busy silently calling either Tony or Pepper for help. He was sort of hoping to keep this conversation between the two of them.Then ... then JARVIS surprised him, a little. He shouldn't have, Rhodey shouldn't have actually let it blindside him. But."You want to talk about the secret he kept?" JARVIS asked, with a freakish amount of insight. Gently, for fuck's sake. "When he was dying?"... Shit. Also, shit. Fuck, don't just say that shit out loud, okay?Rhodey closed his eyes for a second, hunching forward where he sat, until his fists loosened and the remembered half-grief had ebbed a little. One of these days, he was seriously going to sit Tony down and tell him to stop doing that. The repeated almost-dying thing. He really ... really needed to knock that shit off."Yeah," he agreed, hoarsely. Rubbing absently at his mouth. "Yeah, about that." And then stopped, trying to figure out how the fuck to say this. JARVIS stayed mercifully silent, waiting him out with the kind of patience you only learned running herd on Tony Stark for ten-odd years. Waiting for Rhodey to figure it out.But in the end, it really only boiled down to one thing, didn't it?"Why?" he asked, very quietly. Then louder, with a touch of the shaking anger, the guilt and the grief, that had plagued him. "Why didn't he tell someone?"JARVIS ... hesitated. Formulating a response, maybe. What you called it, wasn't it, when you didn't know what the fuck to say? "I believe he did not wish to distress you, sir," he said, softly, and with that tinge of dubiousness that made Rhodey like him just that little bit more. "When neither you nor Miss Potts could do anything, I believe he wished ... not to cause you pain.""Not to cause-" Rhodey cut himself off, throttled it back ruthlessly. "Seriously? He thought figuring it out after he was dead would be better? He thought watching him ... watching him dissolve for no fucking reason, watching him go off the rails ... He thought that would be better?"He thought it better to make everyone around him come this close to hating him, to judging him for no damn reason, he thought letting them ... letting them betray ...Fuck. Shit and fuck. And Rhodey needed to have better control, he needed to get this packed away, but shit. Shit."... I believe he did think that, yes," JARVIS said, quietly. "If you will permit me, sir ... Mr Stark is not always rational, w
