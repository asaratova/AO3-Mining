Disclaimer: I don't own anything.
AN1 IMPORTANT. PLEASE READ: So, I knew I wanted to do a post-Civil War story and I had a few ideas so I decided to combine a few ideas together and this was the result. To make things work I have had to change some ages, and I have gone with the Phil being recruited to SHIELD once he finished collage as he told Rosalind rather than right out of high school.
These are the birthdates I've changed and their ages as of 2016:
1960: (56 technically. Looks late 20s/early thirties) = Natasha (given drugs to slow her ageing at 13)1967 (45) = Phil1971 (45) = Rhodey1973 (43) =

AN2 IMPORANT: So I know this chapter is insanely long, but I wanted to get all the past stuff done in one chapter so that I could get to present day. I also know there are a lot of gaps and I will fill them in in future chapters, maybe with flashbacks if not then references and explanations.


September 1981: Empire State Academy, New York.



Early Afternoon.



(Melinda May, Tony Stark, Hope (Van Dyne) Pym, 8 years old.)

Walking through the halls of the place that she will be both living and learning at in the foreseeable future Melinda May can't help but wonder what to expect, and she also can't help but wonder why her mother would choose to send her to boarding school. Though, she suspects that it might have something to do with the work that her mother does that she doesn't talk about.Looking at the numbers on the door Melinda finally reaches the room with number seven on it and knowing that it is her room Melinda checks the door and finds it open instead of locked like she was expecting and so she lets herself in.Walking into the room Melinda sees another girl, who looks to be about her age, with dark hair, unpacking a bag on one of the beds."Um, hi." Melinda says nervously and the girl, who has green eyes, turns around."Hi, you must be my roommate." The girl responds."Yeah, I guess so." Melinda answers, "My name's Melinda, Melinda May." Melinda introduces as she walks over."Hope, Hope Pym." The girl introduces, Melinda noticing that she pulled a slight face when she said her last name."Nice to meet you." Melinda says with a smile."You too." Hope responds, forcing a smile, something which she hasn't really felt like doing for a while, "I picked the bed by the window. I hope you don't mind." Hope comments."Not at all." Melinda responds as she heads over to the other bed, as she does Hope puts an ant farm on her bedside table, "You have an ant farm?" Melinda asks, sounding a little surprised."Yeah, I really love bugs, ants especially." Hope explains, looking excited, "My Dad and myâ€¦... and my Mom." Hope says her voice breaking, "Study ants so I've been around them my whole life.""That's cool." Melinda comments."Yeah, it was." Hope says, her voice sounding sad."Are you okay?" Melinda asks concerned, not overly sure if she should be asking but having no idea what else to do."Not really." Hope admits, "My Mom died last year and my Dad sent me here as soon as he could." Hope explains, there being some anger as well as pain in her voice, "What about you? Why are you here?""I'm not really sure. My Mom just sent me." Melinda admits, "She's really busy so I guess she thought this was easier." Melinda admits."What about your Dad?" Hope asks curious."He died when I was three." Melinda answers."Oh, I'm really sorry." Hope tells her."Thanks, but I don't really remember him." Melinda admits."He was still your Dad, though." Hope points out."Yeah, he was." Melinda responds as the two young girls drift into silence as they continue to unpack all their stuff.
After spending a few hours unpacking their stuff and getting to know each other a bit better Hope and Melinda are walking together on their way to dinner, both hoping that they don't get lost."Give that back." A voice says from further down the corridor, "It's mine, give it back!" the voice responds.Exchanging looks Hope and Melinda hurry down the corridor where they find a boy with dark hair and dark eyes who looks to be the same age of them standing between two older boys who are throwing a book between them."Give it back!" The younger boy yells as he jumps up and tries to catch it and he gets close but one of the boys knock him to the ground, causing them both to laugh."HEY." Melinda yell."Leave him alone!" Hope yells and the two of them hurry forward."Go away little girls, this has nothing to do with you." The boy who is holding the book says."You're being mean, yes it does." Hope says and Melinda kicks the boy in the shins causing him to bend over in pain allowing Hope to grab the book."We told you to leave him alone." Melinda says, glaring at the boy which is a quite impressive look on an eight-year old's face."Huh, little girls got teeth." The boy that Melinda kicked says, "But I you know what I'm getting bored with this.""Same." His friend responds and the two of the
