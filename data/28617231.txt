Chapter 1





Chapter Text
 May had waited a long time to find her pack. She had been born an Alpha; her mother had been so proud. She had assumed she’d find all her mates in her early-20s. By the time she was 25 she had set her sights on SHIELD, aiming to utilise her natural gift of leadership, regardless of her unmated status. It wasn’t uncommon for packs to remain uncomplete for many years, as mates were born, or circumstances changed. Although it was hard when many of her friends had already found their pack. Her fellow Academy graduate, Phil Coulson, was an Omega who had found his Beta early on. Clint Barton. As Coulson rose through the ranks, they found their other Beta, Tony Stark, and against all plausible odds, Steve Rogers was their Alpha.Not everyone was destined for a pack, most people were assigned one life partner. May was sometimes jealous of them, it would have made her life far easier.She had found Maria Hill first, at age 30. A spunky academy cadet, barely 20 years old and not yet legal to drink. She was her Beta, although determined to prove she could be just as capable as any Alpha. May had fallen in love from their first meeting. Her mother thought she indulged Maria too much, allowed her a little more wiggle room than she should.As long as her mark was on Maria’s neck, May was willing to give Fury’s second in command all the authority she needed. Of course, what May’s mother would never know was just how much Maria liked to let go of control in bed.In retrospect, her time alone with Hill had been quite a light introduction to a pack, compared to the later chaos of the mix. Hill had found their second Beta, Bobbi, during a scout of the top academy recruits, a year later. The academy was also how they found their precious Omega, Jemma, a few years after that. Jemma had been barely shy of nineteen.It was no wonder it took May so long to find them when they were all so bloody young.They had settled into an easy rhythm: Hill became Deputy Director, May had retired from the field into training recruits, Jemma was still studying in the labs and Bobbi was climbing the ranks as a field agent.Natasha was the wild card May had not been anticipating.Natasha had just been assigned to Coulson after months of extensive assessment in a closed-off compound. May had been briefly stationed at the Hub to pay him a visit. Natasha had immediately attacked May, threatened by the presence of another Alpha. It took a long time to negotiate the pack dynamics, both Alphas fiercely dominant and possessive of their pack. The feud had ended when May allowed Nat to mark her, giving over ultimate authority to the younger woman. It wasn’t on her neck, that had been May’s condition, but that shimmering mark on her inner thigh was certainly Nat’s favourite spot.It took Phil Coulson’s resurrection and a reassignment with Jemma, for May to finally find their other Omega.May watched from the gantry as Coulson and Ward exited the SUV, dragging the hacker in tow. The girl stumbled out, bag over her head and hands tightly handcuffed behind her back. May bristled, her hackles rising as she spied Ward’s firm grip on her bicep.There was a sweet smell in air. May frowned, wondering if it might’ve been a lingering scent in the lab from Jemma.Ward manhandled the hacker up the ramp, and the scent drifted over to May. Her nostrils flared at the scent of daisies, cheap perfume and the undeniable cinnamon scent that marked her as one of her own. An Omega. The girl tripped up the ramp and Ward yanked her harshly back to her feet. May growled a warning, the pair stood still in alarm, the girl tensing and turning her head underneath the bag to find the source of the noise.“Let go of her,” May ordered sharply, making her way down the spiral steps towards them. The girl stumbled back from her, Ward frowned and didn’t move his hand.“She’s an active suspect,” Ward said defensively.“I know she is,” May barked, “but she’s also my Omega so I suggest you unhand her now.”May heard the girl’s sharp intake of breath, muffled from under the bag. Ward raised his eyebrows in surprise but let go of her mate and held his arms up in surrender as he backpedalled. The girl shuffled backwards away from May as she reached out to grab her, not making it far before May had her own steady grip on her arms.She didn’t relax like most Omega’s would, she tensed up more and tried to move out of May’s lenient grip. May glanced over her outfit – purple shirt, black jeans, impractical boots and at least three necklaces. Certainly not a threat, and certainly someone who cared about fashion far more than May.‘Tense shoulders, she’s defensive’ Bobbi’s voice filtered into her head, as she saw through May’s eyes ‘Cheap necklaces. Shirt’s faded in the wash, not been ironed. She’s young. Living alone, maybe. Not much money.’“My eyes are up here,” the girl snarked, muffled by the bag.“Quiet,” Ward snapped. May shot him an unamused eyebrow, he had the good sense to back down.May
