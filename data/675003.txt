Phil smiled, leaning back in his chair. “Well I’m really glad I got time off to see you get married, Erika,” he said honestly. “I missed Bethany and Sandra’s weddings, so I’m glad I get to come to yours.”Erika laughed. “Good job you got off because I already promised mom you were bringing your man with you!”Phil nearly dropped the phone. “What?! Erika! I can’t- he won’t- we aren’t really-“Erika cursed. “Phil! Did you break up with him?!”Phil panicked. “NO! No, I’m not single, don’t tell her THAT, it’s just that he’s a busy guy, he can’t just take off like that, Erika.”Erika sighed. “God, don’t scare me, Phillip! Just tell him it’s important! If he loves you the way you make it sound like he does he’ll be willing to do this.”Phil groaned. “Erika…”“Phil, please?” she whispered in a tiny little voice. “I’m getting married and mom is sad enough you aren’t married. Don’t come alone and let her think you’re losing the one decent person you’ve been with in years! She actually believes the BS story about being a recruiter, Phil. She won’t understand why you and your guy are too busy.” Phil cringed. Erika had figured out his secret long ago. She was the only one of his sisters that knew, but he suspected she was a little bit smarter than the rest of his sisters. “Unless he’s actually a super spy, not just a super spy’s boss, he has to be able to make time for this.”Phil groaned. “I’ll see what I can do-““Phil, don’t do that, just say yes or no,” she interrupted and he once again cursed how smart she was.Phil sighed and let his head fall to the desk, phone still at his ear. “Fine. We’ll be there together-““YES! I knew it, I knew you’d come through! Oh my God I can’t wait to see mom’s face! She’ll be so happy you found somebody, Phil. She barely believes you actually have someone! And Rachel can stop asking around about you every time we see her!”Phil shuddered at the thought. “Look, Erika, I’ve got to go. I’ll talk to you before I head out, okay?”“Alright, and really, I can’t wait to see you again and meet this ‘amazing’ guy you keep talking about. He’s almost too good to be true!” she trilled brightly.After the hung up Phil sighed and let his forehead clunk to his desk. “If only you knew.”

Phil brought Agent Lang a coffee, earning a bright, welcoming smile when she sat across from his desk. “Coulson, what can I help you with?” she asked.Phil cringed. “Alison, I’ve got a huge favor to ask you,” he said, biting his lip. “This is going to sound really pathetic- seriously pathetic- but do we have any junior agents good enough to go under and stay in character well and won’t ask too many questions?”She frowned. “Why is that a pathetic and huge favor?”Phil looked down. “It… isn’t strictly SHIELD.”“How ‘not strictly SHIELD’ are we talking?” she asked and he sighed.“I can write it off as a training exercise on their requirements but it’s completely personal and-“Agent Lang groaned. “If this is another family thing-““Alison, I’m desperate here!” he admitted. He never showed his desperation with many people, but Alison Lang had been a friend for a long time. She’d been his field partner when he’d first come to SHIELD and had been promoted right alongside him when they became handlers. He’d known and trusted her for longer than most people in SHIELD had known him. Which was why he was asking for her help. “After this my only option is to hire an escort to pretend to be a loving and committed partner and convince my mother I’m not likely to die alone.”Alison chuckled. “Phil, we just can’t. Even if you can write it off as a training exercise, something off-book will have to go through Fury and we all know he’s not going to let you do that.”He sighed. “An escort for a full week won’t be cheap, even if I do get a discount for not actually wanting sex,” he offered glumly.Alison grinned. “If you hadn’t told them you had a boyfriend, you could’ve convinced them you turned bisexual and I’d have gone with you. I’ve got some vacation time, but my lack of male features ruins that one.”Phil leaned back in his chair. “Thanks for the offer,” he said with a rueful smile. “Oh well, I guess it is better to avoid the rumors a junior agent would spread around about me after meeting my family.”Alison sipped her coffee. “So what’s the event this time? Last time was your sister’s college graduation wasn’t it? Then that time before was another sister’s wedding.”Phil nodded. “Erika’s getting married.” He cringed dramatically. “Now I’m officially the only unmarried one.”Phil heard a tell-tale thud just behind Alison and froze. Alison apparently didn’t hear the thump, though she definitely noticed when Barton suddenly dropped out of the air to land right beside her. “HOLY SHIT!” she cried, closing her eyes and growling. “Barton! I’ve told you a thousand times, my office is a place to let my guard down-““Sorry, ma’am, but Fury doesn’t know I’m not in medical and he was in
