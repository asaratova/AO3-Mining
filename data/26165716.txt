Chapter 1: Winter's Choice
    




Chapter Text
.·:*¨¨*:·Winter's Choice·:*¨¨*:·.The arrival of Iron Man had the Asset unsettled, his mind was still muddled by the residual compulsion caused by the trigger words and the fight at the airport so he kept his rifle trained even as the helmet retracted into the suit, revealing the bruised face of Tony Stark.“You seem a little defensive.”The Asset tensed when Stark spoke despite the seemingly easy and friendly tone, he could sense the tension beneath it, he always could.When the Captain walked away, shield raised, he found that he was unsure of the intentions of either man and the fragments of the Other screaming in the back of his mind to trust Stevie, protect Stevie, made it hard to think straight.“At ease soldier, I'm not currently after you.”He hadn't been paying much attention to the words spoken, his focus was on watching for any indications that Stark would attack.It didn't feel like he would though and the Asset had learned to trust those feelings.“Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here.”When Stark addressed him directly the Asset tensed again, but this time the Captain, Stevie the Other insisted, signalled for him to lower his weapon, so he did, the compulsion to Obey still strong in his mind.Logically he knew that the Captain was not his Handler, not HYDRA at all, but the compulsion to Obey caused by the trigger words was a powerful one and obeying lessened the pain screaming through his mind.Obeying was easier, less confusing, he needed time to regroup, recover, the fragments of the Other, the one that came before, were telling him that the Captain would keep him safe until he could recover, could make plans to make sure HYDRA could never get him again.The Asset allowed himself to slip into Mission mode, falling into step with the Captain and Stark who had re-engaged the helmet of the suit as they carefully cleared the way through the HYDRA facility.Mission mode was familiar, comfortable, clearing a facility was something the Asset could do in his sleep and it calmed the storm within, allowed him to think, to sort the fragments and silence the storm that was the voices.The fragments of the Other, the one the Captain called Bucky, had been a plague on his mind, each fragment screaming with its own voice, always screaming in the mind of the Asset.As much as the Asset hated the confusion and pain the fragments caused they did allow him to break through the conditioning long enough to get away from HYDRA, to break down the compulsion to return.Being away from HYDRA kept him away from the Chair, and the Wipes, it allowed the Asset's brain to heal and begin to break down the compulsions that HYDRA conditioning had created.The Asset had gone underground in Bucharest trying to piece together the memories that the Chair had disrupted, but it was a slow process.The HYDRA serum had kept James Buchanan Barnes alive through the Fall, the fitting of the Arm and HYDRA conditioning, allowed him to survive the Chair and the Cryostasis, but while it protected his body, his mind remained vulnerable.Over time HYDRA's methods began to take their toll and under the constant stress and pain the mind of James Buchanan Barnes began to fracture.The fracture developed into something similar to Dissociative Identity Disorder and the Asset was born to protect what remained of James Buchanan Barnes, but in doing so the fractured mind weakened further, and shattered completely.The fragments that were HYDRA conditioning and training were joined by memories of military training and formed a Soldier, someone to take the pain, carry out the missions, but in the end it didn't prevent the fragments from shattering further each time they were wiped.The wipes caused significant damage to the synaptic pathways that allowed memory access, damage that the serum couldn't heal, it healed the tissue, but the connections remained severed, the memories still there, hidden deep inside, adding their own voice to the screams of the fragments.In Bucharest the Asset had a chance to heal more, and as the body healed he was able to find and examine some of the hidden memories, connect them to fragments of the Other, and he soon found that if he could connect fragments to memories he could build them into larger clusters.These clusters shared a single voice instead of the cries of their parts, slowly, gradually, dimming the cacophony of voices, but it was hard work and somehow he knew he would never be able to rebuild James Buchanan Barnes, too many of the fragments were a part of the Asset, the pieces just wouldn't fit.And as much as the Asset wanted to rebuild the fragments he would not shatter himself to do so, so he hid, carefully hoarding memories, rebuilding a puzzle with missing pieces as best as he could, he had always been good at puzzles.The Asset had also been planning, searching for information that could help take down HYDRA and ensure that he would never be under t
