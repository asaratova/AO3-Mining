Steve was finally home.He had missed Toni more than he cared to admit, and seeing the familiar place was like a breath of new air. He walked over to in front of the entrance and found a few people standing there waiting.The first person he noticed was a woman with short blonde hair, wearing a suit and standing in a posture that made Steve’s back go straight involuntarily. She had an aura of dominance and a stern face.Next to her was a long- legged, tan skinned woman with long, wavy golden- brown hair pulled up into a pony- tail. She was dressed more casually, in a NASA tank top, light blue jeans, and red converse, but still had a commanding look to her. She was seriously tall, the same height if not taller than Steve.He recognizes the red and blue spider clad kid from the fight in Germany, who, to Steve’s disappointment was dressed in full uniform. Next to him, a tall man in a red cape with a large eye- shaped amulet was standing with his hand on the kids shoulder, seemingly calming the kids never- ending energy.And finally, his eyes rested upon Toni. She looked, well gorgeous, wearing a turquoise shirt and skimpy black skirt. Her tall heels matched her necklace and her make up was done perfectly, the warm colors bringing out her eyes and matching her skin tone perfectly.“It’s good to be back.” Steve breathed.“And who’s fault is that?” The Spider- kid huffed.“It’s fine.” Toni said. “We’ve had some new recruits since you’ve..left.” She spat the words out as if they tasted bad, and walked over to the blonde woman.“This is Colonel Danvers, or Captain Marvel, the new leader of the Avengers initiative-“ But before she could continue, Steve’s team let out a protest.“But that’s not fair!”“Steve’s always led us!”“Please, Wait until the introductions are finished.” Danvers responded, holding up her hand.“Thank you. And this-“ She gestured to the brown haired woman. “Is Skylar Griffin. She’s a trained assassin.”“So you’re trying to replace me.” Natasha said coolly, walking to the front of the group. She crossed her arms and looked at the newly dubbed Skylar. Skylar looked at her with a look of utter boredom.“It’s not replacing if I’m better. More..as an upgrade.” She shrugged. She had an Australian accent, which Steve wasn’t exactly expecting.“And what makes you better than me?” Natasha shot back.“Hm. Maybe that I’m actually loyal to a team? Or that I am not only an Assassin, but I also have two PhD’s? Or that I am simply a better person?”“Alright! This is supposed to be civil!” Danvers cut in. Natasha backed away, but Skylar simply scoffed in annoyance.“As I was saying. We also have Doctor Strange, and Spider- Man. These are only a handful of our new recruits.” Tony finished. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have more important things to deal with.”“So we aren’t good enough for you anymore. We’ve lost our use, haven’t we?” Wanda snorted behind him. He saw Spider- Man and Skylar exchange annoyed glances, Doctor Strange rolled his eyes, and Danvers just nodded to Toni to leave. Strange did some weird hand- movements, and a portal opened. Toni, Strange and the kid hopped through and left.“Alright, we made an agreement that you’d show them around.” Danvers said Skylar. Skylar looked (down) at her with a look of betrayal.“I don’t think that’s the best idea.” Skylar said. Danvers rolled her eyes.“An agreements an agreement.” She teased.“I hate you.”“You love me.” Danvers said, and winked at her before walking back into the compound. Skylar rolled her eyes and walked towards Steve’s group, and Steve realized she was taller than him.“Alright, follow me.” She said, and spun on her heel to walk into the building.“A lots changed since your little escapade. Let’s see, you’re rooms have changed, I’ll show you to them after the tour. You don’t have clearance to the east wing, if someone catches you trying to enter, there will be consequences. You will not be put on the payroll until you sign the accords. Toni, being the wonderful person she is, stepped up and is said to pay you guys an allowance. Six months, money supply is cut. A year, you get kicked out. Capeesh?” She talked all the while walking and leading them through the compound.“I understand. But what do we need money for?” Steve asked.“Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part. There is a cafe now, you have to pay for food-““What? Why??” Clint broke in, before letting her finish. Skylar through a dirty look over her shoulder, before continuing.“Because, Mr. Barton, there are simply too many people being housed here to just have food stocked, and a cafe seemed like the way to go on the organization portion. Prices are reasonable, or so I’ve been told.”“Like Stark needs any more money. This is ridiculous!” Wanda screeched. “We can’t afford it anyway! What should we do, starve.”Skylar threw one of her newly dubbed ‘looks’ at Wanda, and sighed. “Honestly, when Toni said you guys were thick, I didn’t expect it to be this bad.” She stopped and turned around. Steve noticed crims
