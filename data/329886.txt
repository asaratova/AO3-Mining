Chapter 1: Men Out of Time
    




Chapter Text
That day was not the most ideal for a funeral, but Bjarte Brookson was that type of guy. Blindingly sunny backdrop adorned with New York skyscrapers, and a small handful of frail senior citizens playing a hip, jivin' tunes on their guitars, saxophones, and bass as children ran about, jumping over the marbled plaques of the dead. Bright Bart - everyone's nickname for the shockingly emerald-eyed & white-haired fella whistlin' and playing a mean guitar down the block at the steps of the small house he lived in with his father - always dreamed big, had his heads in the clouds, just like those buildings that weren't even finished in Steve Rogers's day, when cemeteries had ubiquitous headstones rather than marbled plaques that were too easy to step on accidentally (which, the children would say, make the dead angry and drag you to Hell).Steve didn't even know Bart was alive until he saw his name in the obituary. And although our favorite Star Spangled Man found out too late to pay his neighborhood friend, short-time war buddy (though Bart was quite the pacifist), and favorite aspiring musician a visit, he knew paying his respects was the least he could do. So when he saw the rather happy scene, he wasn't surprised - Bart was a bright guy, and seeing a few old, old students (apparently after the war he became a music professor) playing such a bright tune, Steve did not question that this was indeed a funeral for his old friend.No tears, no mourning. There was laughter and reminiscing, something Bart would probably prefer at his own funeral; and so, Steve couldn't help but feel embarrassed that he was feeling a little more mournful than the granddaughter who greeted him rather enthusiastically, recognizing who he was despite donning the old infantry uniform instead of his usual star-spangled spandex. Steve thought his friend was dead, only to find out he was alive (Doesn't this remind you of someone?), and felt a slight pang of guilt that he could not hear at least one more happy song from Bright Bart. Granted, the grace of growing old is that dying soon is no huge shock. But, as he let go of his white carnations into the earth, he looked across, and saw the most somber, grieving face----and that face, eyes lightly damp and lips pursed thin, belonged to the God of Mischief, dressed as though he were from another time, Steve and Bart's time. Soft black suit with shoulder pads perhaps too big for him, detailed with dull silver lines and a dull silver tie. Hat tilted low, but not low enough to shadow his grieving eyes. Standing across from each other, one in an old dark suit and another in an old uniform, they were both men of great depression, men out of time, but no one seemed to pay them any mind."Loki," Steve let out of disbelief, barely a whisper, as Loki looked up, smiling lazily as he let go of his bouquet of scentless mayweed. Â They stood side-by-side, watching as cemetery workers carelessly shoveled dirt into the pit and the aging musicians continued their joyous tunes. As others laughed, Captain America felt himself on his toes, felt the hair on the back of his neck standing."What are you doing here?"The normally mischievous god simply looked on, through the grave-men and the musicians and down into the earth. Was there something there? Had he done something to the flowers? Will the dead rise from the graves? The soldier reprimanded himself for leaving his shield at the mansion. He quickly turned his head to face the god when he heard a sigh."Bjarte was very much like him," Loki sneered weakly, and the soldier thought he imagined the somberness, the affection to it, "it was almost unsettling how alike they are."He felt doubtful, and suspicious, but he could not help that he felt inquisitive as well, quite unlike a soldier. "You knew his father?"And Loki simply nodded - albeit hesitantly and slowly -, standing still and tall as a statue does, face carved with harsh, hollow cheeks and high cheek bones and a strangely sorrowful finish, something that Captain America could not comprehend in regards to Loki, God of Mischief and Chaos. It was unnerving."And his mother?"And then Loki simply laughed, low and soft and almost soundless, with a small hint of the usual egotistic mischievousness to his smile. The wind blew slightly, and he held onto his hat, tilting it a bit lower as he laughed. When the grave-men were finished, Loki turned to Captain America, head held high and hand held out, with a devilish smile."Thank you."He stared at the pale hands and long fingers, wondering if he just couldn't see the magic sparking from it, unsure of what to make of the unusually respectful gesture. But nevertheless he found himself slowly taking Loki's hand, shaking with a soft grip."What for?"Loki tilted his head ever so slightly to the side, as he said, "For paying your respects to my son, and listening to his ballads," though the phrase could barely process in Steve's mind.
