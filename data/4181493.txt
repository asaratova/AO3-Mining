Clint took two steps into his apartment, paused, shook his head, and shut the door behind him. He threw the locks, though God only knew why he bothered. "Sofia Santos," Natasha greeted from her seat on his couch, curled up like a lean, dangerous cat, not looking up from her book. "Who?" He stopped moving, his hand hovering over the counter, frozen in the act of dropping his keys. Then the name clicked. The woman who'd somehow stealth-fixed the fences on his farm almost a year ago. She'd paid the workers in cash, they never met her, and the trail was long cold. "Wait, you found her? Where is she?""She's visiting with Director Coulson right now," Natasha told him, off-hand and uninterested.Clint stared blankly at Natasha. "Huh?""Darcy, you idiot." She did look up at that to give him a pitying look. "Really, who else would it be? I don't think any hostiles are going to take the time to get your fences fixed."Clint rolled his eyes and asked outloud the question he'd pondered earlier, "Why do I bother changing my locks?""I don't know. Why do you?" She asked, genuinely curious about his reasoning."Habit?" He guessed. "The shrinks say I'm paranoid.""Only in the best ways, I'm sure," Natasha said with a smirk.Clint chuckled and sat on the couch next to her. "Sofia Santos. Where'd she pull that out of?""Rico's grandmother's name, apparently.""Rico. Nice." Stretching out, he propped his feet on the coffee table. Natasha lips twisted in disapproval. But, it was his furniture, if he wanted to put his feet on it, he damn well could. "Think she'll ever introduce us? If Foster didn't swear she'd met him, I'd wonder if Darcy just made him up as an excuse to get out of shit.""He's real. Besides, you know Stark's met him. And, I think, Rogers, though we've never discussed it."He glanced at her and laughed. "Did you stalk the poor kid?""Stalk is such a loaded term," she said primly. "She was our trainee, I wanted to make sure anybody close to her wasn't a threat.""Rico? A threat?" He scoffed."How would you know? You've never met him." Natasha gave him a glare. "I simply went by his school and observed him for a couple days. He seems decent enough. Hard worker, dedicated, plenty of friends, polite.""You accidentally run into him?" he asked knowingly. "I asked for directions to administration. He walked me to the door."Clint raised an eyebrow at her. "I'm sure he did.""He was very respectful," she sniffed."You liked him," he said, surprised. Natasha rarely liked anybody. Not that she hated everybody, of course. You existed, you were a threat, or you weren't â€” her interest generally ended there."He was charming, in that sort of nerdy way. Sweet."Clint's face fell into a thoughtful frown. "Huh.""Oh, please. Are you jealous of the 'poor kid'?" She mocked with a nudge at his shoulder. "No," he argued back immediately. "Pfft."Natasha laughed, low and throaty. "His situational awareness was terrible. And you know how much I value that trait."He grumped a little and crossed his arms, then her earlier comment hit him. "Wait. Was our trainee?""Yes.""Oh." He looked lost for a moment before resorting to a small pout. "I missed graduation.""I think you were there," Natasha noted dryly. "She graduated when New York fell." "Yeah, I guess so."She smiled at him and patted his knee. "You and Tony are going to have to accept at some point that Darcy's all grown up.""Believe me, I know just how grown up she is." The pat turned into a punch. "Ow. That came out wrong.""I'm sure."Clint shifted on the couch, edging away from his partner and her sharp, pointy fists of death. "So, Director Coulson, huh? You went with her? You saw him?" He asked, changing the subject."I did. He's well enough."'Well enough' wasn't quite the report he was hoping for, but if something was really off Natasha would tell him. "How'd he survive the spear through the chest?""I'm not sure exactly," she told him with a delicate one-shouldered shrug. "Some last ditch process Fury'd been working on. Part of something called the Tahiti Project. Everything related to it was destroyed, apparently. Coulson was tight-lipped about the details."Clint chewed on that for a minute. "Who's his deputy?""Melinda May.""Wow, I'd wondered where she got off to. I thought she was semi-retired. Who pulled her back?""I gather she's back because of Coulson," Natasha said, then her eyes drifted over to him and she frowned. "Did you really lose your temper with Darcy for keeping Coulson's survival from you?"Chewing on his bottom lip, Clint tilted his head back and forth a couple times before admitting with a grimace, "I maybe yelled. A lot. I apologized.""So she said.""She told you I lost it?"Natasha shook her head. "Not in so many words, only that you'd apologized. She was waiting for me to be angry with her, too. It wasn't hard to guess.""Oh. Yeah, not my best moment." He rubbed a hand over his face. "She did good. She held it together, stayed sharp. There were a couple moments, right when ev
