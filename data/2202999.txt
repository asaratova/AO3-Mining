They’re jammed into the galley of Quill’s dingy little spaceship, narrowly free from prison and on their way to sell the damn bane of an orb as they eat a mediocre dinner that is actually worse than the prison food was, although decidedly less likely to be full of broken glass. So there’s that, Gamora thinks, largely unimpressed all the same. Then Quill opens the infuriating device he nearly got himself recaptured for and extracts a piece of it to inspect, and dinner becomes the least important thing on her mind. Presumably he’s checking the device’s components for damage, which is not unreasonable given the circumstances, but that’s not the part she gets stuck on. “What,” she says, eyes locking in on the extracted piece as Quill lifts it up and turns it in his hand under the light. There is a marking on it: a white rectangle split with eight red lines, stacked thickest to thinnest, and another rectangle taken out of it in the middle, above which a row of unfamiliar characters shows. It is a wholly unrecognizable marking to the girl she was the first dozen times it was flayed off her, and she knows the sight of it beyond all doubt. “Oh no,” Rocket groans, locking in on it too. “What. What is that. What is wrong with you.” “What?” Quill asks defensively as he looks up from his share of their worthless dinner, his mouth half-full. “It’s my thing! It’s a thing!” “It’s a thing you nearly got killed for,” Gamora says, still staring at it. Of course. Of course, she thinks, internally seething. “You miserable Terran.” “What?!” Quill protests again, and Gamora just makes an angry noise and drags him out of his seat and into her lap. He attempts a protest but his mouth is still full and mostly he ends up choking instead. “You’re disgusting,” she informs him icily, yanking off his coat and going for his shirt. “Clothes!” he yelps, knocking over her dinner and nearly falling out of her lap. “No!” Gamora snaps back. The meal is no great loss. Groot pulls an inquiring expression; Drax merely appears confused. “Is this typical social behavior among your people?” he asks. “I do not have a people any longer,” Gamora reminds them all savagely, throwing Quill’s shirt across the galley. Some further flailing is involved on his part, but nothing she cannot dodge or restrain, and he is clearly more concerned with not dropping the pieces of his device than actually escaping her grasp, which just makes her angrier. Of course it would be a thing so important to him. Of course. “Where is it?!” she demands, going for his pants. “Oh my god!” Quill protests, and this time actually does fall off her lap, holding his device above his head to prevent damage. Gamora considers kicking him in the head, but Groot shoos them apart with a concerned rumble. “I know that symbol,” Drax says, frowning at the device’s components now too. “As do I! As have I always! Now where is yours?!” Gamora demands furiously, ducking under Groot’s branches to pin Quill to the floor and going for his pants again. It is his fault, she is certain. She has never known what the mark meant, only that it was to be destroyed every time it rose up again, but she knows that it is Peter Quill’s fault. She is certain, now. “Here,” says Drax, who is not the man she expected to answer her. But he tugs the waistband of his trousers down and reveals it on his hip all the same: the mark in red and white and black, strange blue characters and all. “What,” Gamora says. “Wait, you have one too?” Rocket asks, touching his chest with a queasy expression. “What the hell, I thought it was, like, a serial number or something.” “Why would we have serial numbers?” Gamora snaps. “I didn’t know you did!” Rocket snaps back. “What are we talking about?!” Quill demands shrilly from the floor, trying to drag his pants back up. On principle, Gamora drags back. “Hey! Bad assassin! Look, normally I am all about this kind of thing but the exhibitionism is a little much, don’t you think?! Like, we’ve already escaped the Kyln, it’s a little late for the ‘don’t drop the soap’ scenarios, okay?” “Show me,” Gamora says sharply, ignoring Quill to look at Rocket’s chest. Rocket grimaces but tugs the front of his jumpsuit open grudgingly and parts his fur just enough for it to show skin: red and white and black and those strange blue characters, again. Gamora has exactly enough time to recognize the mark before Rocket is touching Groot and Groot is ducking his head and moving branches to bare a matching one on his neck, although his looks more carved in than anything else. “Hey, wait,” Quill says, blinking at them. Gamora yanks up her shirt to show her own copy of the mark cradled in the curve of her ribs, the skin there heavily scarred and mutilated but the mark itself still always rising back to the surface, and he starts choking. “Where is yours?” she asks him suspiciously, and Quill turns bright red. “T-that’s private!” he sputters. “And what are you all flashing yours at me for, anyway, I did
