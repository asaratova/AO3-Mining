Sam Wilson had just been outed by Captain America.Quite an achievement, given that the man had been last seen nosing a plane into the Arctic fifty years ago.He was fresh out of Basic Training, green about the gills (and didn't he know it), but surer than he'd ever been that this was what he wanted. But fuck fuck fuck, this was all going to be over before it started if this counted as telling for “Don't Ask, Don't Tell.”Basic Training had been its own little bubble, contact with the outside world caught in snippets from family or TV. Assignment to a unit was a little less insular, and something as big as Captain America being officially outed as gay (and Bucky Barnes too, for good measure) had been making waves. The interview with Gabe Jones had been on the TV in the mess. The man looked old and so much smaller than in the history books, but he was still proud and upright, saying right to the cameras that sure, the Commandos had known, they hadn't cared, and it was a damn national scandal that they'd all been slapped with gag orders in the late seventies stopping them telling the world about it.Sam had stayed deliberately blank, trying to look like he was only vaguely paying attention, when inside he was laughing, screaming, jumping up and down. He'd been maybe seven when his grandpa had decided to sit him down and tell him the story of Gabe Jones and Captain America (always that way around; never Captain America and Gabe Jones). Gabe Jones, who was multilingual, who ran and broke codes in the field; and not just that, but a crack shot and a useful man with explosives. Gabe Jones, who proved that desegregated units could be the best in the whole army. Gabe Jones, who came home and stood up with the civil rights leaders; who stood tall and calm and told his story when the media tried to make out that he was nothing more than a glorified manservant to the Commandos. In short, Sam's childhood hero and role model.Sam was comfortable with his sexuality, but for his hero to stand up there and say that he was comfortable with it too, it was–it was almost too much. Best damn day of his life, and he had to sit there making sure that no one else knew that.Of course he wanted to read the biography. But DADT was still very much in force, so he wasn't going to go buying the book. Perhaps if he had people around him that he could trust (if he had his own Howling Commandos), but he really didn't know these guys yet. Take his bunkmate, Riley – a doughy white boy with whom Sam was getting on well, but with a Southern accent and manner that made Sam edgy about what might lie beneath.Today, Sam had received three parcels in the mail and was standing by his bunk looking at them in confusion. Riley, lounging on the top bunk, looked at him over the top of his magazine and said, “You got some fan club there.”“Nah. Mom, Auntie, and big sister.”“Your birthday?”“Nope.”“You ain't opening them?”Sam didn't actually know why he wasn't opening them. A vague feeling of... something. He mentally shrugged and tore open the first parcel to find a shiny hardcover copy of the newly published Captain America biography inside.Suddenly Sam had a very, very bad feeling about the contents of the other two parcels. But at this point, stopping was just as incriminating as opening them, so he tore open the second and third parcels and ended up holding three identical, shiny hardcover copies of A Kid From Brooklyn.Fuck. Outed by an alliance of his female relatives and Captain America.And right now, his future in the Air Force depended on what Riley chose to do about this. It took Sam a moment to look up to find......Riley, beet-red with suppressed hysteria. The moment Sam made eye contact, Riley burst out laughing. Sam just stood there, watching him until he composed himself.Eventually, breathless, Riley said, “Awww man, your family think 'don't tell' means 'don't take out an advert on Fox,' don't they?”“It's not funny.”“Funniest thing I've seen all year. Three copies.” Riley leaned off the bed and punched Sam in the shoulder. “Secret's safe with me.” He snickered. “Though not with your family.”“I am so glad that I am providing you with amusement.”“That's how it goes. You bring the funny, I bring the sex appeal.”“Other way around.”“There's a line of women who say different.”“Women with terrible taste. Drunk women. And drunk women with terrible taste.”“I'm real hurt you don't think I'm sexy.”“Sorry I broke your heart, princess.”And that was that. Riley knew, didn't give a damn, didn't breathe a word to anyone, and before he knew it the pair of them were best friends.He read the book in snatched moments, not wanting to take the step of reading it where anyone other than Riley could see him. It made him like Captain America for the first time. In his grandpa's stories, in lessons in school, Captain America had been a boring authority figure. Brave, but basically dull. But the guy in the book, a scrappy little shit who hung around dive bars with d
