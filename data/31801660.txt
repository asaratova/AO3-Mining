Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Bucky was always so gentle with him. He’d come home from work, smelling like sweat and work and something that was uniquely Bucky. Steve would tease him over dinner, flash him heated glances from beneath his lashes like a dame, the way he knew Bucky liked. Sometimes, if Steve was lucky, they wouldn’t even make it to dinner, stumbling back into the bedroom with it’s one tiny bed. Heated breaths panted into desperate mouths.
 
Even when he pushed Steve down onto the bed, Bucky supported him, made sure he went down easy. He’d kiss him, take his time, stretching him open slowly, one finger at a time. Would never press into him unless he was well slicked and could take at least three of Bucky’s fingers. The slide would be gentle and easy, stroking into Steve’s body, holding him close and whispering love into his ear.
 
When he was close, Bucky would always wrap a hand around Steve’s cock, stroke over him carefully, thumb rubbing over the head. He always made sure that Steve came first, was satisfied, before he let himself go. Not that he let up on much of his careful control. His thrusts would get a little faster as he chased his orgasm buried inside of Steve’s passage, never too deep, never too hard. Careful. And soft.
 
After they’d both come, Bucky would slide out of him, check to make sure he hadn’t hurt him. If it was before dinner, he’d hold him in his arms for a while before getting them both cleaned up so they could eat. If it was after, Bucky would curl up against Steve’s back, holding him close, but never too tight, and fall asleep with his face pressed against the back of his neck.
 
He always made sure that Bucky was fast asleep before he let himself go. Steve’s body would shake with the unsatisfied ache deep in his core. Sometimes tears would spring to his eyes. He loved Bucky with every fiber of his being. Would do anything for him. Which was why he never said anything. Why he fought down his need for pain, for it to hurt. Why he never said that it was slowly killing him, this constant unrelenting gentleness.
 
For Bucky, he would be good. He would be more.
