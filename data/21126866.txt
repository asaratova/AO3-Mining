Chapter 1: A morning, a day and a night.
    


Notes:
Hey everyone, so this is my first fic here and also in this fandom. I'm a huge fan tho so I hope to do the characters justice. Please be patient with me, I have a lot of ideas for this fic with so many more characters I want to add and I see it being a long fic or maybe a series but I don't want to rush and write half-assed chapters.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text

 A morning 

Air is constricted. I can’t breathe. There’s rubble in my eyes, I can feel my lungs against my ribs pushing hard. The pressure on my back is far too heavy. I’m going to die. I can’t breathe. Come on! get up Spiderman. Get up Spiderman. Get up-
“Peter Parker! Come on! Get up or you’ll be late!”Peter bolts up from his sleeping position, hitting his head on the top bunk in the process. With a groan and a rub of his sore head, Peter takes a massive intake of fresh air and shudders at its release. He hasn’t had that one in a while. Usually, it was about Uncle Ben or Liz. Sometimes on a bad night, they would merge into one. It probably has something to do with patrol last night.Peter whips his hand under his pillow and pulls out his smashed phone, checking the time. And yep. He was gonna be late.He had ten minutes to get changed and run to the station to catch the train. He would swing but he knows that if he starts he won’t be able to stop until he’s sneaking into second period with a watchful MJ on his case and eventual detention for tardiness. After-school patrolling will have to do today; he can skip decathlon practice to make up for it. Not like they have a competition to prepare for anytime soon anyway. Win-win.Peter is already up, dressed and brushing his teeth by the next time May calls him.“Peter? You better be up.” She calls from the Kitchen where Peter can clearly smell her and the lunch she’s prepared for him, as well as hear her keys lightly clink against her phone in her pocket and the creaking of her footsteps on the wooden floorboards.Great, it was another one of those days where his heightened senses won’t switch off. His nightmare is probably to blame.Spitting out the paste and washing off his brush, Peter jogs to his room and grabs his backpack, flinging it on. It wasn’t heavy, well not much was heavy to him anyway; his bag only had a couple of homework assignments in it and his suit and shooters. The essentials.“I’m up, I’m up,” Peter huffs as he walks into the kitchen to grab an apple and kiss his aunt goodbye.“Hey, hey. Hold up. Freeze, young man.”Peter stills from his spot opening the front door and turns to his aunt.“Did you have another nightmare tonight sweetie?” She asked sadly, looking down from Peter’s dishevelled expression and dark circles to grab his lunch and hand it to him.Peter knew that lying to his Aunt is impossible, well besides Spiderman. That’s less of a lie and more withholding the truth if anything. Or so he tells himself.“Yeah, but I’ll be fine. I got a good few hours in tonight so it’s not too bad,” He says putting on a smile, taking his lunch from May and kissing her on the cheek once more, “Bye May! Gotta run or I'll be late.”With that Peter rushes out the door to run to the station, realising that he’ll be on the receiving end of a passionate lecture tonight about self –care and potential therapists.Peter reaches the platform just on time; he even nabs a seat at the end of the train. He plugs in his earphones and thinks about the events of the last couple of months.It was exactly three months ago since Ned found out he was Spiderman, thanks to the whole lego death star incident. It was two months ago that he and Ned completed his Spiderman suit. It wasn’t anything fancy, but it was a lot better than his first suit as much as he was fond of it. It took them a whole month to finish, with a little help from Mrs Leeds who just wrote it off as an adolescent dress up phase. Ned and Peter saved all their pocket change, lunch money and sold some old toys to save up for the good quality material, which they bought in bulk due to the fact that Spiderman was prone to rips and tears. All in all, it was a decent suit; the public had certainly taken a liking to it too. #spideygotstyle was trending on twitter for two days! Peter and Ned were so proud.Homecoming was one month ago. Peter still didn’t like to think about it. He recalls Stark industries tweeting about the incident afterwards, thanking Spiderman for his brave actions and asking him to reach out and get in touch. Ned had almost had an aneurysm. Although, after some thought, a lot of arguing, pros and cons lists and several sleepless nights, Peter and Ned agreed it would be best not to contact Stark industries. Their reasoning had been simple. Stark industries equal Tony stark equals Iron man equals the avengers equals attention that neither Ned nor Peter wanted. Also, they had a light bulb moment. Stark Industries (AKA Tony Stark) had a
