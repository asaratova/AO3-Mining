Prologue: Coming Home
When Steve finally brings him home, his own face bruised and bloodied, Bucky Barnes is little more than a scared, shivering mess of a man, flinching away from touch and sound alike, eyes flitting nervously around the penthouse, tracking invisible foes and checking for possible routes of escape.Tony watches the feed from the relative quiet of his workshop, mind reeling with mate and safe and Steve, always Steve, the itch under his skin growing worse with every minute now that Steve is back, is home with Tony where he’s supposed to be, but still just out of reach.They had agreed that overwhelming Bucky was to be avoided, decided for Tony to stay away until Steve had calmed Bucky down into at least resembling something human instead of the wild, panicked thing he’d been after the whole Project Insight mess.The problem with that plan, however, is that their private quarters are the most secure place in the tower apart from the holding cells, and locking a confused, brainwashed former prisoner of war up against his will seems not only dangerous and unwise but also incredibly cruel.But the fact remains that there’s another, strange Alpha in Tony’s space, in the space that belongs to him and Steve, and it irks Tony, makes him twitchy as he observes the tiny Steve on the screen trying and failing rather spectacularly at coaxing Bucky out of his ratty coat.Not one known for keeping to the script, Tony soon abandons their original arrangement, unable and even more unwilling to stay away any longer, the urge to touch and smell and hold too overwhelming to ignore.Steve’s expression is caught somewhere between resignation and fond exasperation when he spots Tony stepping out of the elevator, but his whole body relaxes at the sight of him, tension visibly draining out of his shoulders and back even though Tony can sense how exhausted he is, how close to the limit.“Hi,” Steve breathes, pulling Tony in the moment he’s within arm’s reach, nosing through Tony’s always messy hair with a content little hum. “You’re not supposed to be up here yet.”Tony moves back with a mock-affronted gasp, clasping a hand to his chest. “Two months of painful separation and this is all you have to say to me, Rogers?”He turns to face Bucky, ignoring the eye-rolling he’s certain is going on behind his back, freezing mid-motion when Bucky lifts a hand to his neck, pressing trembling fingers to the bond-bite peeking out from underneath Tony’s grease-stained tank top.It’s bold and inappropriate, the move considered far too intimate to share with anyone but one’s bonded, and Tony has to bite back the automatic grin threatening to take over his face. If there is a sure-fire way into Tony’s good graces, it’s by being eccentrically outrageous, after all.Besides, going by Bucky’s wide eyes and jerky movements, there is no evil intent behind the gesture, no challenge of claim. Merely curiosity.Nevertheless, Tony waits for Steve’s reaction, the possessive growling, the Alpha posturing Steve vehemently denies displaying and Tony not so secretly loves teasing him about.It never comes.Tony turns his head in Steve’s direction, frown forming between his brows when he sees nothing but pure contentment on his mate’s face, almost as if this, Tony and Bucky here, together and united, is everything that matters.There’s love in Steve’s expression as he smiles at them and not all of it is directed at Tony himself. Some of it belongs to Bucky and Bucky alone.Tony experiences a brief moment in which he debates being jealous, but the notion is dismissed almost as soon as he catches it creeping into the back of his mind. Love takes so many forms and Steve, Tony knows, has such a huge capacity for it, monopolising all of that for himself would be shamefully selfish, even by Tony’s standards.Bucky makes a questioning sort of noise, raspy as if he’s unsure of his own voice, causing Tony to move his attention away from Steve and back to the ongoing inspection of his neck, Bucky’s calloused hand rough against his skin.“Hurt like a bitch,” he offers with a chuckle, eliciting the tiniest of laughs, more a huff of air than anything else, from Bucky and an awed gasp from Steve.He knows it’s been hard on Steve, this constant lack of reaction and talk coming from Bucky. Tony has spent hours soothing his desperately sobbing bonded over the phone, his own heart on the brink of breaking every single time, back when Bucky had still refused to come back to New York, had only grudgingly tolerated Steve accompanying him on his quest of laying waste to the remnants of HYDRA with barely any acknowledgement of Steve’s presence at all.Bucky seems smaller now, with most of the Winter Soldier gone. Almost fragile, delicate and cracked, just short of breaking and shattering completely. There is strength underneath, power, inaccessible through the layers of pain and hurt caused by years, decades of ill-treatment and abuse, but still present.Tony aches for him, for
