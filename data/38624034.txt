This is a drawing I did for the amazing snipers_and_stories' book Tiny Terran. When I read the first chapter, I was so entranced by the description of Hallifax S'Tarnay that I simply had to draw her, here in the scene where she's defending little Peter Quill from Taserface.
So a big shoutout to snipers_and_stories for this amazing character. Here she is:



P.S.: I do hope I drew her right...
