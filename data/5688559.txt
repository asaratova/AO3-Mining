~*~Tony could adapt in a second.He was a chameleon, with reflexes as fast as Natasha's and eyes as sharp as Clint's.His mind was always racing, looking for ways out (the most common, unfortunately), ways in, different routes.Flying a suit of armor at increasingly high speeds forced this kind of thinking. If he didn't think like this he'd be in the middle of every infrastructure in Manhattan by now.(Which really wouldn't be that bad of a thing, the suit could take it, and God only knows how poorly some of those buildings were made; seriously, it was embarrassing, Tony needed to petition to get everything knocked down and rebuilt by Stark Industries - free of charge.)Dry wall wasn't a good look for him, and neither was accidentally ramming into some oblivious middle-aged secretary named Marge (been there, done that), so Tony made sure to keep his turns sharp and tight and predict every possible variable in a timely manner.It was how he lived his life, predicting and calculating and preparing; Stark men were made of Iron - metaphorically, of course, even if Tony could make it happen - and that meant they were capable and strong and reliable.Tony lived by his father's egotistical motto now more than ever, because reliability was something akin to trust, and the entire team was standing on a layer of thinly laid trust.Thinner than the brittle foundation used in some of the crappier built places around town, and while Tony was eager to knock that shit over, he wouldn't dare touch anything when it had to do with the team.They had accepted him, despite Natasha's lovely Not Recommended spiel, after the Battle of Manhattan.He'd fought, and he'd fought right next to them, even if his SHIELD file was dripping in red, Natasha's pretty handwriting, and the word consultant.During the fight? They'd all been equal, and that, that was something mesmerizing.Tony had never been equal to the likes of a god, two world renowned (secretly renowned of course, because assassins) agents, a man-beast with a heart of gold, and Captain America.No, Tony was selfish and self-volatile (he was sure there were more words to describe him that started with self - really, Natasha's vocabulary was astounding and offending, but he was only proving it right by talking about himself not being self centered).Tony had always been told he was an asshole, self centered and uncaring; when those words had hurt, Tony knew that all of those people had been wrong - because he cared about what people thought of him, and in turn, what people thought about his employees and friends.Because he cared, he cared about everyone on the team, even if no one worried a bit about him.He never wanted to see anyone get hurt, especially anyone in good ol' America, the place that his father had been known to fight so hard to protect - in retrospect, Tony was a disgusting blemish on his reign, and that left a nasty taste in his mouth. In the beginning, it's why he'd made weapons to protect the country; he didn't mean to provide the enemy with the best missiles and tech.
He didn't mean for anyone to die.
And he surely didn't mean for that to put him on the top of the exclusion list. No one wanted to touch him with a ten foot pole after Afghanistan, and when he'd dropped weapon production, the only thing he got out of his so called family was outrage and an attempted murder.This is what made him seem like somebody who worked solo. No one wanted to work with him, because he was too fast, too smart and he had no filter (which was only the product of a constant stream of information, thank you very much). Tony Stark had always been alone and yet, he had always been a team player.He worked well in groups, simply because he was deft at reading people, skillful when predicting their moves in advance, and great at studying - people, books, machines.Studying was one of his favorite things, moments where he could take a person and examine their every move made his heart race with adrenaline; it was like getting a private sneak peek into their mind, and Tony was so lonely that it had sated him each and every time.He'd done it ever since he could remember, and meeting the team had done nothing to stop his habit.Luckily for them, it had helped out on the field on numerous occasions.He was like their Jarvis, a constant help and support, the net that caught them when they fell (sometimes literally, fucking Clint and his constant urge to hop onto and then off of collapsing - see, they really were built horribly - buildings).Jarvis was the only team he'd had before the Avengers. Jarvis was always there, understanding every move he'd make, calculating distances and enemies, sending out missiles without being enjoined.Jarvis knew how well he worked with others, how fast his mind could run when needed.They were one in the same, computers with feelings, who could adapt to anything thrown at them; Tony had made Jarvis, so Jarvis was part of him (which pleased him, because family that d
