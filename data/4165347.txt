Chapter 1: Going Out
    




Chapter Text
You tied your hair up into a classy but neat bun. Some pins secured the masterpiece to your scalp. You sighted when everything fell down, falling loosely on your shoulder. You hated having to dress up. You were way more comfortable in shorts and t-shirts. But since this mission required crashing some fancy, high class party, you were forced to. You were a part of the avengers for almost a year now, but this was your first mission with the whole team. You were mainly paired together with Tony, who was like a brother to you. “Y/N, are you dressed?” Speak about the devil. “Come in Tony.” The door swung open and Tony was standing there, dressed in one of his expensive suits, which of course, fit him perfectly. He let out a small whistle. “Wow, Y/N, You look stunning.” He grabbed your hand and spinned you around. You were wearing a short, tight red dress with black heels. Your black hair was still not tight up, as you wanted. “Thanks Tony, you look good yourself too.” A small smirk appeared on the billionaires face. “I know.” You laughed. “Have you seen Tash?” Maybe she could help you with your hair. “In Steve’s room.” “Okay!” You walked past Tony. You found Natasha in Steve’s room, just as Tony told you. She was busy fixing his tie. “O wow Y/N, you look stunning.” Your cheeks flustered by the comment of the captain. “Thanks Steve, that suit looks good on you.” You smiled as you walked towards them. “Soo, Tash, I was wondering if you could fix my hair, I can’t keep it up.” She smiled. “Of course darling. Sit down.” You did as she asked and soon, your hair was in a perfectly tied up bun. “Thanks!” She smiled at you. “Let’s go!” The three of you walked into the main living room where the others were already gathered. You saw the guys, all rocking their black suits. “Looking good boys!” They turned around to the three of you. “Thanks Nat!” You felt their gaze swift to you. “Lady Y/N, may I compliment you on your gorgeous looks this evening.” Thor, gentleman as he was, placed a kiss on your hand. “Thank you.” You talked for a bit before Tony announced the limousine had arrived. “Let’s go crash a party.” It was a half hour drive, and you were seated in between Bucky and Clint. “All right guys, and ladies. I want to take this opportunity to propose a toast.” Tony handed everyone a glass of champagne and raised his. “To the best team of heroes the earth will ever know. To the avengers!” A cheers erupted from everyone as the glasses were tinkled together. The driver announced that we were five minutes out. Everyone started to nervously check their weapons, and gulp down their drinks. “Y/N, if you don’t mind me asking, but where the hell did you leave your weapons.” You looked up to Bucky, who covered his knife and shove it back into the hem of his pants. “Euhhh, I…” You had two knifes in your bra, and a small gun strapped to your upper leg, barley covered by the length of your dress. “Let’s just say I hid a gun and two knifes where no gentleman will look.” You saw Bucky’s cheeks turn red as you laughed. “Ohh..” You laughed even more about his sudden shame. “I also have some pretty amazing heels from my Kingsman days.” You kicked off one of your heels and clicked the heel of, showing a large needle. “Enough to put an elephant to sleep within seconds.” He looked at you in amazement. “I would certainly not want to make you angry.” You could almost hear some fear in his voice. The car stopped and before you got out, Steve, being the Captain, spoke up. “All right, I assume everyone knows we ought to be careful and silent. There are a lot of civilians in there, and we don’t want them to get hurt. We communicate through the earpieces. Anything suspicious gets called in. I want to get us all out in one piece.” Everyone nodded, and soon you were standing in a huge ballroom. "Wow, this is amazing." Natasha, who was standing next to you smiled. "I totally agree with you, Y/N." Suddenly you felt someone grab your hand and pull you towards the dancing couples. "Hey!" You looked up only to see your fellow avenger, smiling down on you. "Just blending in."
