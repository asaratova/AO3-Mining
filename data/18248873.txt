Chapter 1



Summary:

Okay I just had a small heart attack. I nearly lost everything I wrote for this story due to a bit of idiocy on my part. So while I wasn't planning on posting this so soon, I don't want to risk actually losing it. So up it goes!Also, I am super happy people like Mai so much!P.S I can't take credit for the stark watch. I got the idea from this great little fic Another Field Trip Fic by Jackson_Overland_Frost. Disclaimer: I don't own anything.



Notes:
I have edited this chapter and all the others so if you notice any changes when re-reading that is why.

Chapter Text
Peter made it to class just as the late bell rang.“Ah, Mr.Parker. Late as usual.” Mr. Harrington voiced dryly.“Sorry, Mr.Harrington,” Peter replied as he made his way to his seat.Ned looked over at him in concern, waiting until he was seated to ask “Dude, you okay? You look exhausted.”“What? Yes.Yeah. Definitely! I am so okay that I’m fine and shit. Yeah.” Peter trailed off at the look of amusement MJ was shooting him.“Even I could tell that was a lie,” Ned stated with a shake of his head.“A simple yes would have sufficed.” MJ agreed, turning back to her book.Peter floundered for a response and was thankfully kept from replying by Mr.Harrington.“Mr.Parker, Mr.Leeds, Ms.Jones if you three are done?” “Sorry, Mr.Harrington!” Peter and Ned echoed among snickers. MJ merely shrugged in response.“As I was saying. Today we will be going on a field trip. Now as many of you are aware, I have kept where we are going a secret.”Murmurs of excitement filled the room. Mr.Harrington had kept the destination a secret since he revealed the trip nearly a month ago. Whenever someone asked he would just tell them it had to do with science and he was thrilled they even get to go, added to that was the fact they had to sign NDA’s and even a waiver. Which obviously meant they were most likely gonna be doing and/or seeing something potentially dangerous.Peter lost interest at that point as his Stark watch lightly vibrated on his wrist.

 Attached was a picture of Harley and Mai covered in flour. Mai was sitting on the counter laughing as she smushed eggs into Harley's hair. And even though Harley looked deadpan, Peter could see the amusement glittering in his eyes. Peter's lip twitched upwards. He could never leave those two alone in a kitchen, can he?

 Peter was dragged out of his conversation with Harley by a loud bang a few inches from his hand. Looking up with wide eyes he caught sight of a smug Flash.“Better confess now penis! It just may save you some embarrassment.”Peter furrowed his brow “Embarrassment from what?” He asked confused.“That’s what I was trying to get your attention for!” Ned said excitedly “We’re going to Stark Industries for our field trip!”Peter’s mind blanked. His watch vibrated.

Hey you okay? You’re heart rate just skyrocketed.
 “Oh? What’s that face for penis? Finally realized you can’t keep up with your shitty lie anymore?” Flash taunted.“Shut up Flash. No one cares about your obsession with Peter.” MJ called over, her expression bored.“The only one obsessed with him is you!” Flash shot back.MJ raised a brow “Right, you’re just obsessed with his dick.” Laughter flittered across the room as Flash worked his jaw in anger “Wha-I-You!”“Enough! The bus is waiting for us outside.” Mr.Harrington said as he re-entered the room.Peter didn’t even notice him leave.

I’m good. Just a loud noise that startled me.

❤Future Husbando❤Sureee :/ Peter sent him back a heart emoji as he headed out of the classroom with the others......The bus ride there went a lot smoother than Peter had feared it would.After boarding Peter had quickly put on his custom noise-canceling earphones that Harley and Tony had made him a few months back.According to Harley, he didn't like seeing Peter flinch whenever they went out somewhere crowded. It was a sweet gift that Peter absolutely loved and used pretty much every time he went out. They were lightweight and fit easily into his ears, almost unnoticeable if you weren't looking for them. The best part? Peter could change how much he could hear, so he could still wear them and have a conversation.Flash had also tried to get his attention a couple times during the ride but Peter was more interested in his conversation with Harley. Eventually Flash got so annoyed that he gave up, slumping back into his seat with a scowl.Peter was dragged out of his little bubble by Ned excitedly hitting his sh
