Chapter Text
She ran from roof to roof trying to avoid the people chasing her. Her dark brown hair was tucked into her hood, her mask was in place. Her bow was secured across her upper body, her pistols on either side in their holsters on her thighs, her swords on her back under her quiver.She was running for almost five minutes now, they had found her when she was busting a big drug deal. She isn't the enemy.She is a vigilante. The people chasing her are the law.This wasn't their first encounter. They started following her a few months prior. She always got away, staying in the shadows and being unseen from the others. But today there was light, it was day. She usually only went around at night, but this drug deal was big and she had to stop it.She was almost at her apartment, where she could've disappeared. Suddenly, she heard an arrow being fired and flying only inches past her hood, she then heard a gun shot and a sharp pain in her back. It took the air out of her lungs and she stopped dead in her tracks, she tried to breath, the pain subsided fast, but will still come up once or twice. She found herself turning around after catching a breath.She was met with a small group of people, in either tactical gear or their own customized gear. They all had their weapons trained on her. A blonde guy with a bow and arrow ready to shoot, a red head woman with a gun in her hands and a dirty blonde haired woman had batons ready to defend herself if necessary, stood out. The others had their, what seemed like standard rifles, ready to shoot with green laser pointers.“Hands up!”, the blonde guy with arrow yelled towards her.“On your knees!”, the woman with dirty blonde hair and batons in hand yelled.She didn't have much choice, she stood at an edge of a rooftop, ten stories down was a little alleyway. She could either try to run or surrender. She didn't like both options. She decided to do the only logical thing there was. She slowly raised her arms and dropped to her knees. The group came slowly towards her. The red head took a hold of the womans arms and handcuffed her. They moved her, so she could walk and made their way towards a plane or jet of some sort. They haven't talked to her or told her where they were going, they only talked to each other in riddles. Maybe codes they had for this kind of situation.They sat her down and she was left alone, the plane jet thingy took off and she leaned back in her seat. She was starred at from someone, but she couldn't care less.She didn't want to be the one to talk first, she could just easily dislocate her thumb and get out of these cuffs. Take down the people that turned their backs on her and get out. But then again, they were in a jet she couldn't fly.She was in her own thoughts, but still very aware of her surroundings. She was aware of how the jet landed and the whole thing came to live again. She was pulled up from her seat and lead to the hatch of the jet. She could make out a big deck, which meant she was on some kind of carrier from the military or something. What irritated her was that it sounds like she's on a plane.She was pushed forward and lead into the the ship. They walked through never seemingly ending hallways and she memorized the whole route, so if she had to break out she knew how and where to go.It took almost ten minutes until they stopped right before a door. They opened it and she was brought inside. They took of the handcuffs and the blonde guy with the bow brought in a big box.“Put all kinds of weapons you have into this box and sit down on the bed until we have left the room”, he ordered and left the room for her to put her weapons in the box.She rubbed her wrists, where the handcuffs had been and took a look around. It looked like a cell and interrogation room in one. It wasn't big but comfortable enough for a prisoner.The room had a bed in the corner furthest away from the door. There was a metal desk and two chairs, right when you enter the room. There were two cameras and an one-way mirror. She was pretty sure, that the ones who brought her in where standing behind that mirror and probably the boss of this institution as well. She looked directly at the mirror, took off her hood as well as her mask. She put her mask in the container and took off the little glass monitor glasses and started with her weapons.Beginning with her two pistols, taking them out of their holster, removing the magazines, clearing the bullet chamber and putting them in the box separately. She continued with her traditional sword on her left side of her hip, then the two swords from her back, the bow followed with the quiver and the countless knives she had. She pulled two from each boot, four from her legs, six from her arms, five from her hips and upper body and two from under her gloves, as well as two out of her hair. She had throwing knives, butterfly knives, karambit knives and other types.The last thing she got out of a chamber on
