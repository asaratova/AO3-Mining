Chapter 1





Chapter Text
He couldn’t take his eyes off of him, still pale and all bandaged up with a machine helping him to breathe and so many tubes attached to him. The heart monitor was beeping, either it was reassuring them or taunting them, he wasn’t sure.Still watching his godson all Nick Fury could think about was that this was his fault, he was the one who made the avengers, he added Tony to the team thinking that they will protect him. But of course, he was wrong, they didn’t protect him they used to live in his house on his money and he made weapons and gears for them if anything he protected them.In the end, it took him a shield in his godson’s chest to realize that he was wrong all along. He was wrong, so fucking wrong. He had broken the promise he made to Maria and Peggy all those years ago to protect Tony and it all stemmed from the god damn team he created. The only two right members in the team were Banner and Thor but even that he doubted since the latter choked Tony and the former ran away and left him to take the blame for Ultron all for himself. Well, it was the witch’s fault anyway.But it was Captain America, Steve fucking Rogers he was most angry at, he wants to kill the hypocrite super-soldier. The man that people believed in so much turned out to be a selfish man that would do anything for what he believed in and for Bucky Barnes like killing innocent civilians and almost kill his teammate (friend, what friend? They were definitely not friends).The thing that shocked him most was being shown the video by Friday of what happened in Siberia. How dare he lie to tony about his parent’s death? Howard was his friend, sure but they were his parents he had every single right to know and the worst part is that the fucker used Tony’s money to search for his parent’s murderer, and had Tony known the truth in a calmer environment then he himself would have helped Barnes. Besides Tony was trying to hit Rogers anyway after finding out he lied and he was clearly holding back because the missiles in his suit would have killed them in an instant.He would love to revive Howard and show him what the man who he searched for most of his life leaving his family did to his son with the shield he made and ask him to be thankful that Tony Stark was never like Steve Rogers.He looked around the room to see the people here waiting for the fallen hero to wake up, he looked on the other side of the hospital bed and saw Sharon Carter holding her cousin’s hand like he would disappear if she let go, she was still blaming herself for what happened since she was the one who gave Cap his shield back but no one could actually blame her for falling for the golden boy's charms but that had clearly ended since Rogers put her only living relative in a coma, the only reason she wants to see him now is to shoot him in the head.Next to her was Pepper Potts, working silently on her laptop and he had no doubt that she was digging up things of rogues that would make sure they were never viewed as heroes again. The Rogues underestimated Pepper, sure she couldn’t fight but she would destroy anyone who dates to hurt Tony. They weren’t dating now but they were still best friends and he was still her family.On the other bed in the room lay Rhodes, who lost his ability to walk because of the rogues but he would be able to after physical therapy, he refused any treatment unless he was in the same room as his best friend so that he can make sure that nothing happens to him. The man was still planning with Coulson, Carol, and Vision on how they should work till the time Tony wakes up but he was casting glances here now and then.Coulson, his team, and Vision were the ones who rescued Tony exactly 24 hours ago from Siberia and they were lucky, if they were a few minutes late Tony would have died from blood loss and frostbite. When Fury said to Coulson he owed the man his life, he said he owed him no such thing since Tony was his friend and family. Vision too said that Tony was practically his father so it was his duty to save him (the android himself was hurt by the betrayal of the people he considered friends and of the women who he thought loved him). Carol was called to earth by him because he trusted her and she was Rhodes’s and Tony’s friend too and he was sure she would have their back and when she came she also promised him she was not leaving earth since there was a group protecting the galaxy now. She was murderous when she found out what the rogues had done to her friends and promised herself to make them pay, well all Fury can think of is Roger's reaction when he faces off with a real Captain (Rogers was no Captain, he never even finished boot camp).Sitting next to him was Hope Van Dyne, Tony’s childhood best friend and practically his sister even though they talked less with their busy lives after they became old, Hank Pym might have hated the starks but Janet and Maria were best friends, and even after Janet died (or went mis
