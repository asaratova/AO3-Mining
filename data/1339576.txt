Chapter Text
A soft newborn cry echoed through the night, waking the sleeping couple on the bed.A groan came from the bed and a messy head of long black curles appeared."I got it, babe."  Another head appeared as it's owner slowly got up.Barefoot he badded across the room from the bed to the small bassinet that occupied the little noise maker.He shivered slightly, his sleeping pant not helping with the nights chill."Hello, little darlin'." He reached down and picked up the wailing newborn."Don't cry baby girl." He hugged the small body to his chest and started to sway. "I got you.""Dean." A soft voice made him turn towards the bed to find his lover slowly siting up."Don't move, Har." Dean moved back to the bed. "You're still tired and sore from giving birth."He sat on the edge of the bed leaning against the headboard."I think she's hungry." He caressed her soft plumb cheek and watched her open her mouth, searching for food. Making her parents smile and coo at her.Harry raised his arms to take the offered baby from his husband, unbuttoning the matching shirt of his husbands sleeping pants.As soon as he pressed the little seeking mouth to his swollen nipple she latched on and started to nurse."Not so hard, Mary Jo." Harry wiced, looking at his little baby.Dean chuckled and kissed him when he raised his head to glare at him."Not fair." Harry grumbled against his lips, prompting another chuckle from Dean who gave him another peck before bending down to kiss his baby's forehead."We did good." Harry raised his head to look at Dean, who only had eyes for the little baby. Awe filling his features."Yeah, we did." Harry said resting his head against Dean's shoulder.They spent the rest of the feed in silence until the baby finished and was handed to Dean to burp."Go back to sleep, baby." Dean got up from his place against the headboard. "I'll take care of the rest." He gave him one last kiss before moving closer to the bassinet.Harry didn't go back to sleep.He laid back on the bed, watching Dean cradling little Mary Jo to his chest, swaying softly and singing to her quitly with a smile on his face."Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder."
They didn't notice the four transparent figures looking over them from the shadowed corner. Two men and two women smiling at their sons and new born granddaughter.
