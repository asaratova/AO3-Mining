Chapter 1: In the Beginning
    




Chapter Text

In one of those funny coincidences of timing that turned out to not actually be a coincidence, Anthony Edward Stark was born when the technician working on the first microprocessor put down his soldering iron, sat back in his chair and said, “I’m finished. Whatcha think?”

He was in a cleanroom that made a surgical room look filthy; sterilized white walls, plastic booties over his shoes, pale blue scrubs over his clothes with a cap over his hair and a white mask that ensured that every technician looked like the last. His coworker, occupied in his own project, barely looked over before saying, with a hint of dry sarcasm, “Looks like it’s going to change the world, Bob.”

Not very far away, in an actual surgical room that was the best money could buy, Howard Stark was presented with his firstborn son and heir. Since his only previous experience with children was filtered through nearby Hollywood, Howard was nonplussed to discover how little a human infant could do in the first months of its life. So even though little Tony was walking and talking by his first birthday, knew the letters of the alphabet by his second, and was doing basic math problems by his third, each milestone was celebrated but accompanied by the mild sense that Howard was disappointed that he didn’t do it sooner. In any other family, Tony’s technical skills would have been appreciated for the small miracle that they were, but in this family, with an engineering genius like Howard Stark as a father and a musical savant like Maria for a mother, with someone like the magnificent Margaret Carter occasionally swooping in to bring the whole family back down to earth, Tony’s skills were seen as generally par for the course. 
In any event, despite of all this, it would probably be more accurate to say that Tony Stark was actually born in a cave in Afghanistan, covered with blood, sweat, and dirt, having died just a little bit first.
