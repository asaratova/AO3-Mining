Chapter 1: A little pup named Steve (Bucky x Reader) (implied smut)
    




Chapter Text
Bucky x Reader“Doll, what are you doing?” Bucky mumbles, his left hand reaching out and skimming his metal fingertips up her bare back, making her shiver.“Buck, I heard something” Y/N whispers back, her head turning back and forth, her eyes searching the dark. Then she turns to look down at Bucky.“You need to go check it out” She whispers, her finger poking his muscled chest. Bucky groans and attempts to pull her back down to him but she tuts and jumps out of bed, clad only in a pair of skimpy red panties and lace bra.“Bucky” she whines, walking around the bed to his side and poking his face.“You’re my knight with a shining arm, Buck. You need to protect me and go check it out” Y/N teases, running her hand lightly down his chest towards the top of his black boxer briefs.“But, Doll, what did you even hear?” Bucky complains, his eyes finally opening to reveal bright baby-blue eyes, which lock onto Y/N’s Y/E/C eyes.“I heard a lot of scratching and banging in the hallway outside our door. But – “ Y/N runs a hand down Bucky’s chest before jumping up and straddling him.“We can make a bet. If you come and check it out with me and there’s nothing there, I’ll reward you. But if there is something there, then you’ll reward me. You game?” Y/N leans down and looks into his eyes, her own sparkling with mischief.Bucky hums, his eyes looking around the room in the pretence of thinking about it, then his eyes flick back to her, a mischevious smile on his own lips.“Doll, you have yourself a deal” Bucky’s hands go to Y/N’s thighs and sits up, quickly standing up with Y/N’s legs wrapping around his waist, her arms around his neck. He starts to walk towards the bedroom door, his hands under her thighs, one warm and one metal cold. Bucky chuckles into Y/N’s ear, his long hair tickling the side of her neck.When he arrives at the front door, her gently puts her down, and watches her quizzically when she grabs a large baseball bat and walks back to him.“Darling, I literally have a metal arm, I don’t think you really need that” Bucky points to the bat with a smirk. Y/N shrugs and gestures for him to open the door.Rolling his eyes, Bucky carefully opens the door, looks around and goes to gloat at Y/N but a small bark draws his attention. With a confused look, they both look down and see a young, golden retirever puppy sitting at the front door, its large blue eyes looking up at them.“Aw” Y/N instantly bends down and picks up the puppy, hugging it to her chest as she looks up at Bucky.“Can we keep it? Please, Buck? We can call it Steve” Y/N laughs at Bucky’s sceptical expression.“You want to name the puppy after Captain America?”“Come on Buck, it’s Steve in puppy form! The blue eyes, the golden fur” Y/N trails off, her fingers scratching at Steve’s chin.“Well, Steve’s gonna have a field day” Bucky mutters, and Y/N let’s out a yell of delight.“We can keep Steve?”“Yeah, we can keep Steve” Bucky presses a soft kiss to her lips, and then smiles against her mouth.“If this is your reward, what do I get?” Bucky bites his lip as he looks down at Y/N, who sinfully licks her lips.“Anything you want”
