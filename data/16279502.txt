Chapter 1: Introducing... A Tiny Kid With Super-Strength and a Billionaire With a Heart Problem
    


Summary:

The backstory.



Notes:
It's a bit of a weird backstory, but it's all I could come up with. Next chapter is first meeting! (Tony's POV)




Chapter Text
The Ten Rings is more complex than you would think. After all, they gave a someone super-powers.
However, it wasn't without trial and error. Screaming filled the hallways of their crude testing facility. All but one of their subjects were adults, above the age of eighteen. All but one of their subjects died. All but one of their experiments failed. 
 
And the one that survived was a one-year old kid. 
 
They had taken him during a secret raid on New York. Their leader had heard crying from an apartment building nearby, and it was not helping create the much-needed silence for them to plant the bomb. He snuck in through the back window and kidnapped him. The boss had a soft spot for kids, but this one just kept crying. He placed him in the back of a car and set up the explosive. They drove away without a trace. 
 
Richard and Mary Parker were devastated. They searched for the child for as long as they could. Before they died. 
 
Six years later, the boy was training with the terrorists. He always wore a mask. He couldn't take it off or he would be beaten. He learned how to fire a gun, to use a knife, and to throw a grenade. He learned hand to hand combat, and could take down everyone. It helped that he had strength, agility, and the weird ability to stick to walls. 
 
That same year, there was a new prisoner. 
 
His name was Tony Stark. 
 
And he was getting out. 
 
No matter what.
