Work Text:
The moment that Steve saw his friend fall down the train, he wished that he could save him from the long fall.Knowing that he couldn’t do anything, Steve knew that he wasn’t fast enough and it was probably his fault that Bucky fell from the train.He could see him falling and couldn’t do anything about it.Steve knew that he failed, it wasn’t good enough.“We were meant to be together.” Steve said, watching over, looking to see where Bucky's body is, there was nothing but white, there was no sign for Bucky Barnes.“BUCKY…” Steve shouted, he could feel tears falling from his eyes, knowing that he lost his partner.
