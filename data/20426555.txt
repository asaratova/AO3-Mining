Chapter 1: The capture
    




Chapter Text
“Don’t step out of the suit!” Steve knows it’s fruitless to yell, he’s too far away and the comms are dead, but he has to try. Somehow AIM managed to separate Tony from the rest of them and Bucky jumped to his rescue when the suit seemed to be in trouble. Steve keeps an eye out on their fight, but he’s fighting three of the enhanced fire breathers himself, who do a good job of keeping him busy and away from where Tony and Bucky are clearly struggling. They have to end this fight and be quick about it, but they are short staffed with Bruce on the other side of the country for a lecture and Thor off planet.“On your left,” is all the warning Steve gets to jump to the side as War Machine comes flying over and decapitates one of the enhanced with his laser beam.“Get to Tony!” Steve yells at the colonel, hoping he’ll pick it up above the din of the battle. Steve doesn’t understand how the War Machine suit isn’t affected by whatever they did to the comms and Tony’s suit, but damn if he isn’t grateful about it when Jim answers him with a thumbs up and speeding away. That leaves two enhanced, which is a much more even fight. He holds his shield in front of his face as one opens their mouth to spit fire his way, when suddenly the air is torn by a huge explosion, throwing him backwards. Above him he sees Sam hurtling through the air amidst pieces of debris, bouncing against a nearby building and falling down to the ground in perfect silence. The blast has rendered Steve deaf for a few moments, followed by a high pitched noise, and then sound comes blasting back.Steve takes the moment of confusion to take his shield and break the neck of the nearest enhanced fighter. The other has disappeared while Steve was distracted by the blast. In the corner of his eye, he sees Sam getting up and so Steve runs in the direction of where he last saw Bucky and Tony, not coincidentally the direction the explosion came from. What is left of AIM seems to be retreating, chased down by agents of SHIELD, but Steve pays them no attention, he has to get to his friends. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong and he runs to where he last saw them chanting  please be alive, please be alive  over and over in his head.He high jumps onto a low roof when he suddenly hears kids crying, a sound so alien on a battlefield that he nearly loses his handhold. He scrambles onto the roof and climbs up the next one, making his way climbing and jumping to where he last saw his friends. He resolutely shoves the thought that they are dead as far away as he can as he goes as fast as super-humanly possible. Finally,  finally , he comes upon the spot and dread rises along his spine to settle deep within his core. In a corner the War Machine suit lays slumped as dead as the comms, but that isn't what punched the air from Steve's lungs as if he'd been hit. On the roof where his friends are supposed to be are only some pieces of the Iron Man’s armour and Bucky’s rifle. 
_________________________________________________________ Pain and an overwhelming sense of… of  wrongness , but he can’t place it. Tony tries to open his eyes and is overcome by the need to throw up. He barely manages to roll to the side to spew out a bitter liquid, hacking and coughing until his body lets him relax again. Someone rubs over his back and it helps a bit. He doesn’t know why he’s on the floor, but somehow Jarvis always knows when he’s feeling down or off and how to take care of him.When the retching stops he slumps backwards and waits for the pain in his head and the nausea to subside before he opens his eyes again.The sight makes panic surge through his body, clawing at his throat and making it difficult to breathe. He’s not at home, he’s in a… he’s in a cell! He frantically looks around for Jarvis to cling to, but the only one here with him is another boy who sits back to watch him with sad eyes. Tony scrambles onto his ass and backwards as far away as he can, pulling his legs up against his chest when his back hits the wall. The movement makes  something  in his chest jostle, and when he puts his hand on it he feels something cold and hard instead of his skin. He tears at his shirt, which is much too large for him, to stare with disbelief at the contraption in his chest. He recognizes it instantly because Howard was working on it with that Russian man. An arc reactor. 
 They put an arc reactor inside his chest. 
He has trouble breathing as he stares at the blue glow coming from the middle of his chest and panic takes over. Everything is wrong. He can’t remember how he got here, he can’t remember surgery. He can’t breathe as he claws at the thing with his nails.  It needs to go. It needs to go.  He sucks in wheezing gasps of breath, willing his lungs to cooperate, but for every breath he tries to take he  feels  it against his ribs and it intensifies his fear to the point where there’s no air coming and he hears a faint ringing in his e
