Work Text:
Simon is an art auctioneer who has a gambling addiction. He’s in deep and he ends up borrowing money from a dangerous man named Franck. In a last ditch effort to clear his debts, he’s roped into pulling off a heist at the auction house where he works.
The heist goes wrong and he suffers a serious concussion. He wakes weeks later in hospital and remembers he was in on the heist, he was meant to deliver the painting to Franck but failed and somehow now can’t recall what happened to the it, the memory is just… gone. 
—
It’s not long before Franck and his men catch up with him. He’s beaten badly, they pull out his nails and come close to pulling teeth but nothing they do can pull out the memory of what happened to the painting. The doctors advise that only time may recover missing memories, however psychotherapy has also been known to help. 
—
When Simon walks into David’s practice, the therapist regards him intensely. His grey eyes piercing as they catch the bruises and scrapes on Simon’s face, the bandages on his fingertips and the wire peeking out of his shirt. After Simon has left, David investigates and finds out about the heist, about Simon, the concussion and weeks of recovery. Aggrieved, he runs his hands down his face and knocks back a tumblr of whiskey.
The next time Simon comes in for a session, David quiets Simon with a finger held up against his lips, turning on a pre-recorded tape of his voice. Simon smiles, curious, but tenses, eyebrows furrowing as David shows him the cue cards he’s prepared.
‘Are you in trouble?’ Simon nods.
‘Are they listening?’ Another nod.
‘How many?’
Simon holds up four fingers. He starts when David shows him the next card, a picture of the missing painting.
Then David is grabbing Simon by the back of the neck, pulling him close suddenly. Too stunned to react, Simon can only cringe as David speaks into the wired mic, confronting the men listening in the van parked outside. He shows Simon the final card, Simon’s eyes round, blue and worried.
‘I can help you’

When David meets Franck, he demands an equal cut of the money as the condition for his co-operation. Without David Simon might never remember, and Franck will never find the painting. Franck attempts to brush him off, intimidate him, but David hold his gaze, his eyes intense, steady and calculating. Franck concedes. 
—
They’re all seated in a circle in a dim room as David’s steady voice leads Simon down, down, down into a trance state. 
—
Simon is safe in his apartment, waiting for a delivery, the package that contains his memories of the events of that day. It arrives wrapped in black plastic, secured with duct tape and zip ties. It’s shape is organic and it’s heavy, with an unsettlingly give when he holds it. Franck and his men crowd around his dining table as he peels back the layers of plastic, but there seems to be no end, the web of zip ties rip the bandages on his fingers as he tears through layer after layer, his fingertips are leaving streaks of blood on the black plastic, his hands are shaking, his breathing quickens, heart vibrating in his chest as the men close in around him- 
With a jolt, he wakes from the trance. Stifled in the dark room surrounded by Franck’s men, eyes boring in to him, he walks out, desperate for the fresh cool night air. David follows him out onto the roof. He stands on the ledge, a precipice. As David talks him down, distracting him with questions, Simon opens up about how he meet Franck, about the tightening noose of his gambling addiction, about the money he owes, the trouble he’s in. Wryly he jokes that he should have tried hypnotism for his addiction and David’s eyes crinkle in the corners. Maybe next time. 
—
When they return, David pulls Franck aside. The problem, he says, is Simon’s fear and paranoia that Franck and his men will hurt him once they have what they want. Franck is silent in a way that does nothing to reassure him. David leans in, eyes never breaking contact, putting weight into the words he says next. ‘We only need to make him /believe/ his fears are unwarranted. If you and your men go under, he will be reassured.’
Franck scoffs, ‘Absolutely not’. 
—
Franck and his men are seated in the dim room before David, Simon is standing off to his side. 
‘I have prepared a word, when I speak this word, you will descend into a world of your own deepest fears. Only I can bring you out again.’ 
When David speaks the word, nothing happens and Franck looks around, his men chuckle, even pretending to play along. Franck has a snide remark ready but it dies on the tip of his tongue when he realises Nate, seated beside him, has his head is bowed, seemingly deeply asleep. 
The man writhes in his chair, sweat beading on his brow, struggling to cry out as if robbed of breath, jerking but fixed in one spot like an animal caught in a snare. 
Simon’s eyes flicker between Nate and David but David’s eyes remain fixed ahead, impassive and entirely unmoved by the choked cries of man
