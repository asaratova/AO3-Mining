Chapter 1: Humiliation
    




Chapter Text
Harry Potter looked in the mirror. He didn't often get a chance to himself but today was his tenth birthday and the Dursleys had gone out for a change.
As a matter of fact they had been gone for several days at this point; but Harry didn't mind. He had plenty of water to drink, he had finished the chores Uncle Vernon had left for him to do and he had even found a ten pound note while doing the laundry, with which he had bought a loaf of bread and vegetables to eat.
Looking in the mirror he saw that he was still small and scrawny. He was much shorter than other boys his age and felt that keenly especially when his cousin Dudley, who was much larger than other boys was around.  His hair was dark and unruly, despite the amount of shampoo he used, and conditioner, which seemed to only make it softer and even more tangled. At least that usually covered the odd lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead and at least the Dursleys let him shower everyday. As a matter of fact Uncle Vernon insisted on it; saying that it was bad enough one of 'his kind' had to live with them and that he should at least smell like a normal person, though he was usually forced to use feminine soaps and shampoos, due to them being on sale more often than the more masculine ones reserved for dudley.
Shedding his clothes Harry got into the shower,and, looking down at his small hairless penis, began thinking back to the previous week, when he had been cleaning the bathtub and his cousin Dudley had walked into the bathroom. 
 
Not seeing his cousin behind the shower curtain scrubbing, Dudley had pulled his pants down around his ankles and began peeing into the toilet.
Harry had stopped scrubbing as soon as he had heard someone open the door and had looked over through the gap in the curtains at his cousin, and had seen his cousins penis. 
It wasn't anything like his. It was longer and wider and even had short curly hairs around its base; Harry had stared in shock at the sight of it, mentally comparing it to his own and coming up short. 
Dudley had seen him as he was pulling his pants up and shouted for his parents while Harry cowered.
Aunt Petunia came bustling into the room immediately, anything to do with dudley brought her faster than a ant to honey. She took one glance of the situation; dudley with his pants around his ankles and harry in the tub, half hidden by the curtain, and started yelling.
“You Pervert! You laid your freak eyes on my diddley!” She grabbed harry and shook him violently, as was her way. Harry vaguely noted Uncle Vernon walk into the bathroom, in his slow lumbering manner, as he was being shook.
“You're just a little monster, and now it turns out you’re a pervert too! I don’t know how we could be so kind as to keep you in our house for all these years, and feed and water you out of the goodness of our hearts, and yet have you try to lay your little freak eyes on our little dudley!” Petunia dropped Harry back into the tub, either not wanting to touch the freak anymore, or her arms were beginning to tire.
“Freak…” Muttered Vernon in the background, a strange glint in his eyes.
“I’m sorry Aunt Petunia, I didn’t mean to see him, I was just cleaning and he came in…” Harry trailed off his explanation, knowing that no matter what he said, it would mean little to the dursleys. He hung his head down in shame, hoping to weather the verbal tirade without gaining any punishments; something he knew unlikely with his aunt screaming as she was.
Apparently he was correct, and more punishment was on its way. Harry felt his heart sink as he heard his Aunt;
“Stand up Freak.” He knew better than to defy his Aunt and stood up in the tub. 
Before Harry knew what was happening, Aunt Petunia reached over and grabbed his too-large jeans, previously Dudleys, and yanked them down around his ankles, underwear and all. Harry Gasped in shock as the cold air rushed around his waist, and he felt goosebumps rise all along his skin in response to the sudden absence of clothing.
“Little Voyeurs like you should have to put up with what our poor little Diddly had to go through at least, freak.”
“Ha! Your so small! You're nothing like a real boy your age! Maybe freaks like you don’t grow like real men do.” Petunia sneered. Harry felt his eyes begin to water, and couldn’t help but glance around the room. His Aunt was laughing, with something he had almost never heard from her before, real mirth. It was that, more than the odd glint in Uncle Vernon's eyes, and his laughter, or the curious stare and laughter of his cousin that really got to him. For as little as it actually happened, it was obvious when Aunt Petunia was being honest.
For more than a minute the three Dursleys laughed at Harry, who was trying to avoid the odd look in his cousin and uncles faces. But as his eyes were forced to meet his aunt, he saw a glint of evil he knew all too well, as she reached down and took the pants away altogether.
