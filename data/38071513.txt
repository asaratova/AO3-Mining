Chapter 1: One
    




Chapter Text
With crossed arms and a cigarette hanging from the corner of her mouth, Hayden eyed her father aiding her sister in tossing belongings in the trunk of the family van.  Occasionally they'd trip on the uneven, cracked pathway connecting the sidewalk to the front door."You're just gonna creep over us until we're done?"  Jenna shouted up to Hayden, hand on her hip, tote bag hanging from her shoulder. Hayden blew a gust of smoke into the air as a response.Jenna rolled her eyes and trotted back up to the house.  Their older sister Willa sat in the kitchen, probably sipping on an overpriced iced latte, not helping as she promised she would.  Hey, if Jenna was mad at Hayden, she'd have to be mad at her.Smashing the bud against the ash tray, she made her way downstairs, dreading the lecture her dad would definitely give for "lazing around"."Look who crawled their way out of their cave."  Dad took a break from lifting to place his hands on his hips.She ignored his jab and grabbed a water bottle from the fridge, fully intending on returning to her room.  Instead she was stopped by Willa's arm."You sure you don't wanna stay with me and Dean? That extra room isn't gonna be in use any time soon."  Willa stirred her green straw, the ice cubes clanking together."I'm good,"  Hayden took a sip of her drink when she extended it out. "I only have to deal with Dad for less than a year more.""You know we're down the block. If anything, jump the fences and come over." Willa winked."Alright," Jenna flipped her blonde hair behind her shoulder. "I'm ready for goodbyes.""Goodbye." Hayden waved unenthusiastically at her in the doorway."C'mere," Willa brought her in for an embrace. "It's not that long of a drive, babe. You even need a tampon, and I'll be there in less than 45 minutes.""I know," Jenna faked a sob. Done with her exchange with Willa, she waved Hayden over. "Get this over with. I know you're not emotional."Feeling a sudden wave of longing wash over her, Hayden let her sister wrap her arms around her, surprising everyone with a hug back. It'd be the first time it would just be Hayden and Dad; the house is definitely going to feel lighter."You know the drill; Thanksgiving." Jenna reassured hayden, subtly pointing her head at Dad. "It's not that far away if you think about it.""Yeah, yeah." An unintentional whimper escaped her throat. Dad, outside, leaned against the car with a proud smile plastered across his face. "Get in. I want you settled before any other animals get there.""People like that aren't gonna be there for the first week." Hayden mumbled. "You'd know.""Watch it," Willa warned through a smile, patting her lower back.With the family gone, Hayden had the house to myself, something she wasn't very fond of. So to kill some time, she was off to the corner store, snacks and a sandwich on the brain, despite knowing Dad would more than likely bring dinner."Hey, Ricky." She nodded at the store owner behind the counter, who reciprocated the greeting.At the back of the store, she mindlessly eyed the hanging collection of chips. The chime coming from the entrance snapped her out of it, and she rolled my eyes at the couple ordering at the front. The two held hands and sweetly giggled to themselves. She hated seeing people from school out in public; made things even worse having a tiny handful of them living within her neighborhood.Hayden reluctantly returned to the front to retrieve the sandwich, avoiding eye contact at all costs. She recognized the two as classmates, and they seemed to notice her staring as she waited. She awkwardly slid my phone out of my pocket, checking for non-existent messages. "Here you are," Ricky slid the sandwich to me while she got out cash. You really can feel when people have their eyes on you, and they certainly did.Hayden barely barked out a "Thanks." before snatching the bag and storming out with her head down.A quick look at her phone and she saw a message from her friend Julia, but she didn't bother responding. Behind her, not having walked that far yet, the blonde kept her gaze on Hayden.
