Chapter 1: Invitation to Movie Night
    




Chapter Text
An explosion resonates in the air. Beams of light reflect off the Iron Man armor as it hovers soundlessly in the sky, repulsors locked onto the swarm of doombots in the distance as he blasts them into an inferno of ash and molten metal. Tony drops into a free fall before he swoops down, flying in a low arc through the raging fire, FRIDAY’s calm voice echoing the next destination in the suit. Clint is perched on high ground, a hidden ledge on a rooftop overlooking the city, eyes unblinking in concentration as he stares through the scope on his bow. One by one, the explosive arrows light up the street in a timed manner, exploding bodies of the robots thrown into the air and falling like confetti made of metal shards. Tremors from the blasts reverberate across the ground making shallow cracks form on the concrete, nearly knocking everyone off their balance.Bucky glances at Steve and Natasha as they dash around in tandem, fighting off the bots with a flurry of high kicks and heavy handed punches. While the red haired woman hurls one away by the heel of her foot, another’s about to jump onto her back and Steve isn’t close enough to help fend off the assault. Bucky watches intently, preparing to snipe it at the right moment when he notices the bot fall to the ground before Natasha could turn back, a stun arrow impaled on its abdomen. “You good on your own, Hawkeye?” Bucky asks as he presses the button on the comm in his ear. “I’m gonna head down. I’ve had enough of these shitty bots already, they need some punchin’.” “Or more like  you  just wanna punch them,” Clint snorts. “But yeah, go ahead, I’ve got it covered up here.” At the confirmation, Bucky slings his sniper rifle across his back and jumps down from the balcony onto the roof of a broken car, the frame bending underneath his feet. He casually walks into the road towards Steve and Natasha when a robot charges at him, and he crushes its head in his metal fist, flinging it to the ground where it shatters into pieces, exposed wires sparking and fizzling out. The sunlight casts a flying shadow onto the buildings as Sam glides past, weaving in and out between the skyscrapers while surveying the area from above. He’s reporting back the team’s locations and extent of damages to the others situated in the Tower when he comes across an alarming number of doombots scurrying off into the inner city, where the civilians had been evacuated to the disaster shelters.  “Shit, that’s not good. Iron Man? I could really use some of your help here, these damn bots are escaping.”“Uhh yeah- no can do Birdie, I'm a bit occupied right now,” Tony grits out, the sound of his repulsor blasts echoing through the comms.Sam sighs, spreading his wings wide open as he descends and shoves past a cluster of bots. One of them grabs onto his leg but he rapidly shoots it off, sending it crashing to the ground below. “Okay, is anyone else willing to lend a hand? I’m heading East.”Natasha moves gracefully, her fighting style reminiscent of a feline as she fades past the bots, twisting her limbs and wrangling them within the entrapment of her thighs before flipping her body over and frying the bots’ internal circuitry with her widow bites. “Sorry Falcon, same here.”“Me too,” Steve intones. “Me three, would give ya' a hand but I'm kinda using it right now,” Bucky says, giving a sharp left hook before lifting his muscular leg high up, swooping it around in a 360 degree turning kick to take down the surrounding bots. He looks at their deformed metal bodies with satisfaction. As much as he’s skilled at marksmanship, Bucky does find close quarter combat more rewarding on occasions like this one. Screw these doombots. They were having a  perfectly  relaxing day before they showed up and started wreaking havoc. “Ha, good one,” Clint sniggers, as does Tony. Steve mutters quietly in the background, voicing his concern and Tony has to fight the urge to roll his eyes. “Oh c'mon, Steve, a little mid-battle banter too much for you to handle?”“Saying this yet again,  code names during battle, Iron Man. And no, I'm just saying we should stay focused. This is the largest number of doombots we've ever faced, and the last wave a few months ago wasn't even  half  this size.” Steve expresses, tossing his shield like a glorified frisbee to cleanly cut through the robot's body before it bounces off the wall, Steve jumping up and grabbing it out of the air.“Hah! I  knew  I wasn't going crazy,” Clint remarks. “There’s definitely a lot more of them this time around. Where’s that asshole Doom anyway? That guy’s got way too much time on his hands to pull a stunt like this.”The battle continues on steadily and Sam tries to shoot at the bunch of withdrawing robots but some of them keep slipping through and getting further away. He groans loudly. “Seriously? You're all busy?”Bruce makes a nervous noise from where he’s standing inside the Quinjet, watching everything
