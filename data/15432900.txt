 With them, there always had to be some kind of bet going. It hadn’t been intentional, really.Ever since the Rogues’ arrival back to the United States, and their relocation into the West Wing of the Compound, things had been tense, for a lack of a better word.The New Avengers were housed in the East Wing, along with Tony, and any amends that the Rogues wanted to make – however poorly intended or executed – were difficult to make. The new family Tony had bought, as Barton liked to say, were vicious in their protection of him.Leading the charge was Colonel Rhodes, and even on the days when he was in the wheelchair, he struck an intimidating figure. His girlfriend, and their new leader, Captain Danvers, may or may not have been looming at his shoulder, but she’d made it clear that forcing their hand was not recommended when it came to the wide berth and cold shoulder Tony gave them.Hell, with the way things had been going, Tony hadn’t exchanged even three words with the entirety of the Rogues – and he’d have preferred to keep it that way.Of course, the media front they were putting up that the Avengers are united required at least some unavoidable interaction, and that was how Tony found himself standing next to James “Bucky” Barnes at a conference.Polite – if not stilted silence – was what Tony expected, instead, Barnes offered quietly, “I bet they’re taking bets that this goes badly.”“What, you and me standing next to one another?”He shrugged. “Just you and me in the same room together.”Tony didn’t disagree. There were a multitude of reasons, after all. The first being history and the second being statistics, though some would argue that it was one and the same, really.See, in the year 1987, among a world population of 5055636132; an estimated 46390 died. Of those 46390, a third was a result of an automotive-related incident.The long story, everyone’s heard before. But for those who hadn’t, the short story was summed up to Howard and Maria Stark; and how they were unlucky enough not to be part of the 46390 who didn’t die in a car crash that year.The ensuing drama that proceeded that discovery, however, had less to do with Tony being misled about their deaths and more to do with the fact that he’d been lied and used by his childhood hero to protect the man responsible, something the media ate up with abandon.The Starks weren’t unfamiliar with tragedy; attempted assassinations and kidnapping ploys were plentiful in Tony’s childhood, but a betrayal from his friend, the Captain America, and for there to be video evidence? It was like the Kennedy assassination all over again, except no one expected the physical altercation that followed.No one could tell if there’d even been a winner.Tony came back from Siberia with an unattached Winter Soldier arm before undergoing eight hours of intensive surgery.There’d been speculation, of course, bets drawn, and simulations created.Some argued that Tony having to go through surgery was a sign of defeat, not that he could be blamed.It was two Super Soldiers against one angry man in a can, it wasn’t exactly a fair fight.And at least in that they were correct.Tony had built a suit out of junk in a cave after open-heart surgery, fought off the group of terrorists that had him imprisoned and tortured for three months, and Tony’s most pressing matter at the immediate end of that debacle was that he was little dehydrated from wandering around in a desert for a few days.The Super Soldiers was going up against a walking tank – an emotionally fragile tank with a unibeam that could cut a mountain in half – and no amount of varied and extensive Super Soldier training would really withstand a suit of armour that had stood toe to toe with a pair of Gods, not to mention the Hulk on full Rage-Monster.If Tony wanted them dead, they would be.They were lucky that Tony had the presence of mind not to all-out level the bunker.With perspective enough to process that Barnes, at least, was as much a victim to Hydra as Tony was, murdering Barnes would’ve weighed heavily on his conscience.Not that Rogers ever gave Tony the benefit of the doubt. He did, after all, go straight for the closest thing to a kill-shot he could get without turning French medieval and slicing Tony’s head off his shoulders with the shield.Tony wondered if his strong resemblance to Howard was the reason Rogers aimed for the arc reactor and not the face.But that was a graveyard he wasn’t about to dig up. Nope.Point of fact: Tony and Barnes getting along once the Rogues returned with their shiny pardons in hand, was stastically abysmal.Tony wouldn’t be blamed for not wanting to be around Barnes, let alone wanting to stand next to him as the press insisted. But the fact that the media were angling from a reaction from Tony, and that Barnes knew it too, well, that changed the game, didn’t it?“How much do you wanna bet that they’ll lose it if we get along?”Barnes huffed out a hesitant smile. “Not taking that.” When Tony po
