Chapter Text
Peter’s Stark watch was designed to alert Tony if Peter was injured or suffering from a panic attack. It was connected to Karen who would send a message to FRIDAY, alerting anyone at the tower about Peter’s condition. If he was injured, it would scan Peter for the injuries before sending the alert. After everything that had gone on with Toomes and the so called ‘Infinity War’, Tony wanted to do everything he could to keep Peter safe. Also, it was a way to ensure that Loki didn’t hurt Peter. The two had become friends almost the day Loki arrived at the tower, much the dismay of everyone else. Despite all Loki had done to help defeat Thanos, no-one trusted him, especially not Tony when it came to the welfare of his son. Peter didn’t care what anyone else said, he liked Loki and trusted him so ignored what everyone else said about him, and about what happened in New York. He didn’t care what they had to say because Loki had explained everything to him during that time. None of it was his fault. They had both tried to explain this to the rest of the team, however, none of them believed them saying that Loki was just manipulating Peter. Peter knew they were lying, what Loki said, how he described it, and the emotion showed could not be faked- not even by Loki. Despite the many protests of everyone, they became close friends- like brothers- and Loki would do anything to make sure Peter didn’t get hurt. Peter foolishly thought the snap would have humbled Flash and possibly made him a better person, but he was wrong. Flash still went out of his way to make Peter’s life hell despite everything that had happened.  He didn’t often get physical, he hadn’t since before Thanos, until Peter decided to stand up for himself. ‘I should have just kept quiet’ Peter thought bitterly as he picked himself up off the floor after Flash and his friends had gone, well he says friends, it’s more that they’re scared of him that they actually like him. It wasn’t too bad, Peter supposed as he sat down in class. He’s had a lot worse and the bruising should be gone by the time he gets home so no-one will know what had happened. What Peter had forgotten is that he had been wearing the watch Tony had designed for him and that had sent an alert to the tower. Loki was alone back at the Tower, the rest of the team out on ‘official Avengers business’- he was bored so decided to watch a Star Wars movie seeing as Peter was obsessed with them, Peter claiming the only crime Loki had committed was not watching Star Wars yet. About an hour into the first movie he got the alert from FRIDAY that Peter had been beaten up and was injured. Loki wasted no time, teleporting straight into the classroom Peter was in. The teacher and the rest of Peter’s classmates looked stunned and fearful at the sudden arrival of the God in full battle armour. “Loki, what are you doing here?” Peter asked, confused by Loki’s arrival. “You are hurt Peter, FRIDAY alerted me.” Loki said, voice sounding calm despite the clear look of anger on his face.  “I’m fine Loki, I promise. It’s just a few bruises and they’ll be gone soon.” Peter said, sounding slightly worried about what Loki might do when he found out who did it. “It is not fine for someone to hurt you Peter. You are like my brother and I will not see you hurt”. “Who was it?” Loki yelled. Everyone in the class daren’t speak, too scared of what Loki might to do them.
“And do not think to lie to me. I am the God of lies”. Loki’s voice boomed. No-one dared to speak, too scared of Loki and what he may do to Flash when he found out it was him. When no-one would say he used his magic to find out, using it to drag Flash from his seat and hover in the air in front of Loki. Flash tried to move, desperation and fear shining in his eyes. “I’m so sorry, I won’t hurt Peter again”- Flash said, voice pleading for mercy from the raging God. “Not good enough”. Loki snarled in a voice laced with malice and venom. He dropped Flash out of the air and onto his feet before pushing him against a classroom wall. He conjured one of his daggers (butter knives) and held it to Flash’s throat. The class let out a gasp as terror gripped the room. Yes Flash was a dick and deserved to be punished for what he did, but this was too far- he did not deserve this. “Loki put him down. It’s just a few bruises, I’m sure Flash won’t do anything to me again, right Flash?” Peter pleaded, stepping closer to the God. “Y-yes”. Flash whimpered. “No Peter, he hurt you, I won’t let some worthless human do that to you. You are worth a million of this scum”. Barked Loki, grip on Flash tightening. “Loki please, I don’t want this. For me please just let him go and we’ll talk about this. Okay?” Peter said softly as he reasoned with Loki. He placed a hand on Loki’s shoulder and this, along with what was said seemed to snap Loki out of his rage. “Only if this is what you want”. Loki replied, putting away his dagger and letting go of F
