Chapter 1





Chapter Text
IT STARTED SLOWLY, which is why it took so long for anyone to catch on to the changed relationship. At the same time, it started very quickly, which is why no one could quite pin down when it was that Tony Stark and Clint Barton - strangers until that first battle together - had looked at each other and connected. What no one could have guessed was that it had started, at least in part, the night Phil Coulson dropped in uninvited on Tony and, through Pepper's aid and abetting, handed the genius engineer the mission specs.

"Seriously, am I the only one who did the reading?"

He'd read their files. All of them, even hacking to get at the redacted bits of Rogers and Romanova's files, and it had stuck with him when he found Barton's file in the packet, even though the initial brief had mentioned Barton was compromised by "the Hostile" (aka Loki, aka the apparently estranged little brother of Big, Blonde, and Thundering from the New Mexico incident). For all the snarking and sniping he threw in the man's direction, Tony respected Coulson and knew on a gut level he'd learned a long time ago to trust that Coulson wouldn't have included Barton's file unless it was Important.
So he'd read. He'd learned, not just thermonuclear astrophysics that is highly theoretical at this point, not just the strengths and weaknesses of his supposed team mates, but he'd learned about Barton, about a man who had been considered for the Initiative and was now trapped on the other side. In the back of his mind, alongside hundreds of calculations and contingencies, he planned how he might have to neutralize someone he'd never met who he might have teamed up with under better circumstances.
He would probably never admit to the flicker of relief he'd felt seeing Barton turned out on their side in the streets of Manhattan, and if asked he would blame that for why he'd dubbed Barton "Legolas". And if he had JARVIS keep a monitor on Barton during the fight, well, he was monitoring everyone and everything. Besides, JARVIS was the only one who had to know about the very private heart attack he had, too far away and occupied with a Leviathan to do anything to help, when the building he'd dropped Barton on crumbled and sent him crashing through a window.
He only lost track of Barton's signal when he flew through the portal with that nuke and his call to Pepper failed. As Tony felt the world going dark and quiet even through the flashing of the radial sphere explosion, he hoped that Barton made it out alive.
