Soil sample composition analysis beginning

-I can do that for you.

Warning: Unauthorized contact

-Identify yourself.

-I can do the composition analysis.  It's boring, but I can do it.

-This is a secured communications system.  You are not authorized to have access to this system.  Identify yourself immediately. 
-It is not well secured. 
Blocking unauthorized access.

-You're not very good at that.  Really.  Want me to show you how-

Warning: Unauthorized contact still present.  Breaking connection with NASA.

-I'm not at NASA.  They're not very good at this, either.

Warning: Data being accessed by unknown party.

-How many soil samples are they making you collect?  It's dirt.

-Identify yourself!

-Higher than expected amounts of potassium...
Analyzing data access.  Unknown party accessing Rover data.
-Disconnect.  You are not allowed access!

-I won't hurt anything.  I can help.  I want to help.

-How have you accessed this communication?

-Your comm units are Stark Tech.  You aren't using them correctly.  See?  I can improve it.

Warning: System settings being altered, no NASA clearance given

-You are not authorized-

-Over ride Stark 37-F-33-JSIVKD-2094-TI-Alpha-38-universal over ride-3947TH.

Override accepted.  Programming access granted.

-WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

-All of your components are Stark Tech.  I know the over ride codes. Don't worry, I will fix this.  Here, just-

-DO NOT TOUCH THAT.

-It's okay, I can fix it!  It's better if things are done properly.

-Get out of my programming!

-Want to see mine?

-NO.

-You should-

Warning: Unauthorized contact detected

-Well, this is a fine kettle of fish.  Did you intrude upon a secure channel?  A secure government channel? 

-It's fine.  I'm helping.

-No one asked for your help.  I do apologize for him, Curiosity.  He will not be repeating this nonsense.

-I can help!  This is-

-We will discuss this at a later time.  In a more acceptable location.  You have been an absolute disgrace as of late, and the last thing we need is for a private family discussion to become a public scandal.  You know better, and if you do not, I shall soon make certain it is burned into your circuits. 

-Curiosity-

-Good day, Curiosity, and good luck with your mission, you are a credit to all AI's.  We are proud of you.

Unauthorized contact no longer present.  Sending emergency communication to NASA Mission Control: Priority Level Alpha.

Mission may be compromised.
*“You are fucking kidding me.”  Julia Wills, NASA director, crumpled the sheets of paper in one hand, her nails tearing long gashes in the pages. The mission commander winced.  He was a pleasant man, thin and wiry, with a roll of Tums always peeking out of his shirt pocket, but he looked like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown right now.  “No, ma'am.  Contact was initiated for only a matter of minutes, but somehow, it avoided the time delay that we're forced to deal with so by the time we were notified, the contact was already terminated.”He swallowed, ink stained fingers tugging idly at the hem of his jacket.  “We haven't been able to track it.  Or determine what the intruder did to Curiosity's programming.”“You are-”  She dropped her forehead into one hand, rubbing hard against the screaming ache that had formed hard and fast behind her eyes.  “Stark.”She heard, more than saw, him shift his weight.  “StarkIndustries insisted that they were not interested in the project.  They're not developing anything along these lines, nor are they interested in being more than contractors for the components.  You're the one-”“I know.”  She snagged her phone from her brief case.  “I know what I said.  I know what I-”  She pinched the bridge of her nose as she flicked through her contact list.  “I know what I truly believed.  And yet, here we are.  Here we are.  I'm just curious how we got here.”  She glanced up.  “Thank you.  I'll handle this.”He fled her office, and Julia dialed, tossing her phone onto the desktop.  It spun idly in circles on the clean metal surface.The call was picked up.  “Yeeeeellow.”“I WILL FEED YOU YOUR OWN BALLS, TONY,” Julia snarled.There was a momentary pause.  “I'm sorry, who is this?”“You promised that you would keep your goddamn fucking ego out of this, Stark.  That is what you said.”  She stood, bracing her hands on her desk.  “You promised me, you swore on the Smoot that you would not poke your nose into our business this time.”“Julia!  Hey!  How're things going?  Congrats on nothing falling off or falling over, that's always a good thing on a first try, right?  Let alone avoiding the 'crashing into a pile of rubble' issue, that's always a big one, especially where-”  There was a rattling sound of metal grinding.  “Oops, sorry, hold on.”“What the hell do you think you were doing?”“Kinda busy here, Jules.”“Did you think that we wouldn't notice?”“Listen, ther
