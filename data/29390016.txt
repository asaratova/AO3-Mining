Chapter 1: Mr. McGoatface
    




Chapter Text
The move from Wakanda to Avenger’s Tower goes about as smoothly as Steve expects. Tony doesn’t look at Steve or Bucky—doesn’t even glance in their direction, really—but their rooms on the seventeenth floor have been stocked with everything they could possibly need to survive. Steve’s mattress is perfectly firm, the mini fridge is stuffed with his favorite kind of sandwich meat, and the painting hanging in his bathroom was commissioned from that artist fella he follows on Instagram. Steve doesn’t even know how Tony found out about that; do social media apps track the pictures you like?“Stark hates me,” Bucky says, after he finishes examining every inch of Steve’s room for cameras, bugs, and potential weapons. “I don’t blame him, but…God, Steve. Why’s he letting us move in?”“It’s part of the modified accords,” Steve says. “He’ll keep an eye on us, and we’ll help him prevent any threats to world security. It’s a quid pro quo.”“It’s a trap.”Steve tries to smile. “Tony doesn’t hate you, Buck. He’s working through his feelings. We all are.”He watches Bucky settle himself on the recliner. The leather is light blue, Steve’s favorite color. Tony must’ve remembered that, just like he remembers everything about the people he cares about. It hurts Steve like a knife to the throat, thinking about how much he’s fucked this whole thing up. He doesn’t regret not signing the accords, not for a second. But he’ll never forgive himself for hurting his family. He’ll never stop trying to fix this, not for as long as he’s alive. Bucky wraps his arms around himself and leans forward, shifting on the leather seat. A strand of hair falls out of his ponytail and into his eyes. “This is never going to work,” Bucky says. “Sure it will.” Steve tries to keep his voice upbeat. “You’ll find happiness here. We both will.”Bucky snorts—he actually snorts—and Steve would be comforted if there wasn’t such viciousness buried in the sound. Steve forces himself to remember the way Bucky used to laugh, with his head tilted back and his eyes wild and his perfect teeth smirking. The man before him is a shadow of the old Buck. His frown lines are deep, his teeth are crooked from getting hit in the face one too many times, and his eyes…his eyes are as dead as a corpse.“You look like death,” Steve says bluntly, when he can’t think of a kinder way to phrase this. “Have a little faith.”“I can fake signs of life all you want,” Bucky says without looking up. “But dead is dead, and animals can always smell it.”“Come on.”“Happiness is only temporary,” Bucky says. “And if you think otherwise, you’re as naive as you are wrong.” He gets up, adjusts his denim jacket, and walks over to the door that connects their two suites. Steve crosses the room before he knows what he’s doing. His fingers wrap around Bucky’s wrist—the fleshy one, not the cold metal hand wrapped around the doorknob. He pulls Bucky around, tries to meet his gaze. Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the fact that he’s taller now. He’d give anything to be sixteen again, small and weak but spirited, watching Bucky beat the shit out of guys who mess with them.“Stay,” Steve says. “Stay here with me. Spend the night.”Bucky’s smile is wan. “So you can make me feel guilty for not remembering the color of your favorite shirt when you were six?”“So we can talk.”“Yeah. I bet you want to talk.”“You know,” Steve says, trying to keep his voice light. “When you create a war out of nothing, it’s only a matter of time before you realize the casualties are in your head.”He lets go of Bucky’s wrist. The knob turns. The door between the connecting suites clicks shut, and Steve stands in his bedroom, alone except for the pounding of his heart against his rib cage. ###The mattress is firm beneath his back, the sheets are crisp and cool, and FRIDAY sets the temperature to perfection. Even so, Steve can’t sleep. He doesn’t thrash—basic training taught him better than that—but he stares up at the ceiling and lets his mind wonder. He’s handled this whole situation so badly and managed to hurt everyone he cares about. Tony, Bucky, Sam, Nat, the rest of the Avengers…they look to him to lead them, but he’s so far from flawless that it’s not even funny. Maybe if the expectations weren’t so high, he’d feel better about letting them down time and time again.Steve is so busy beating himself up—and subsequently trying to give himself a pep talk—that he almost doesn’t hear the window slide open.But he does hear it, and he’s up in an instant, reaching for the vibranium shield T’Challa gave him as a parting gift when they left Wakanda. The room is dark, and the blackout curtains barely flutter at all as someone slides through the window. Steve feels his way past the ornate desk and the dangly lamp. His fingers brush against the light switch. He clicks it on.He expects to find the room empty—it wouldn’t be the first time his paranoia got the best of him—and he’s so shocked to see
