Tony’s almost at the door of his lab when he hears it. It’s low, throaty; just a split second of a thing.But it’s undoubtedly the sound of Barnes moaning.Confused, Tony’s brows shoot up to his hairline as he quickly glances behind him, as if expecting to see the ex-Soviet assassin leaning against the wall with that familiar trademark smirk. He’d be staring right at Tony and would make some sort of snide, joking remark about having needed to get his attention – maybe he was looking for Tony to give him a few upgrades to his arm. After all, it had been a while.He opens his mouth to get Jarvis’s attention – instinctively, that’s the place he always goes. He passes it off as habit (which it is), and nine times out of ten, Tony just acts like he simply enjoys being able to have eyes all over the Tower, reporting back to him like his own personal snitch (which he does). (There’s no denying that having cameras and audio in almost every room in the building makes for some great material, most of which he sifts through when he’s bored and compartmentalizes away when in need of a good quip or some harmless blackmail.)But the truth is, after everything he’s been through, knowing that he has Jarvis around is sometimes the only thing that stops Tony three heartbeats short from having a panic attack. Because he still has his nightmares – jolts upright, covered in sweat and nearly voicing the scream in his throat, before spending the remaining part of an hour (when they had still been a couple) letting Pepper hold him in an attempt to soothe him back to sleep. Though he likes to come across as being impenetrable, Tony has learned all too well over the past few years in particular that he is not, suit and all. So, having Jarvis being able to see (almost) all and being able to hear his voice and give him the head’s up is more a security blanket than being part of a big joke.Not that he needs to admit that to anyone, though.But something stops him as he continues to get closer to his lab. And he may be entirely a little shit – this much, Tony prides himself in being and he’ll even correct you if you say something to the contrary – but no one could ever accuse him of being a liar – so he knows what that reason is. It has everything to do with the fact that the private sex life between Barnes and Rogers has never been all that private, though not for lack of trying on the Captain’s part.Despite coming from the same time, the two men’s personalities when it comes to sex couldn’t be more different. Whereas Cap is introverted and old-fashioned with regard to his love life, Barnes is – as Tony would say – ‘out and proud, here and queer (get used to it)’. He’s about as in-your-face and free range with his sexual endeavours as Thor; but unlike Thor, who is simply from another fucking planet and has never really understood the dos and donts of human behaviour anyways, Barnes is just a little troublemaker.He only makes it too easy for the others to hear them; Tony should know. He has exactly eighty-seven audio recordings of the super soldiers’ fuckfests gathered from different sprinklings of rooms all across the Tower that he’s been able to use at the most inopportune – a.k.a perfect – times in order to see how many different shades of red Rogers’s face can get.What he doesn’t tell anyone is how many nights he can’t help but listen through them again; hard in his pants at the way Barnes proves just why he was called a Howling Commando, while he listens to the unmistaken sound of furniture skidding across the floor, things crashing to the ground, bed frames being broken – all from the sheer tornado of a force they are when they fuck, and always leaving Tony’s imagination running with the possibilities of what could’ve caused the better half of those noises.Barnes, despite his gruff appearance – long hair that he refuses to cut, a permanent five o’clock shadow that he chooses only to keep clean but never shave – and the fact that he had only a year before been the world’s deadliest trained killer, seems to be about as enthusiastic about taking dick as a slut in a porno. Well, if the audio is anything to go by. Just because everyone’s used to it by now doesn’t mean the majority of them still won’t take every chance they can get their hands on to make casual remarks and throwaway references that leave Cap sputtering with embarrassment and the Sergeant smirking proudly.But that’s the thing – the hottest thing about those audio files (the fantasies, the hottest motherfucking fantasies Tony can remember having since he was in his first year of college) isn’t Barnes – it’s Rogers.Because sure, with all his moaning and groaning and fucked out pleas, Barnes always sounds like he’d be a glorious sight to behold while his ass is getting pounded into as though everyday were a fucking Fourth of July celebration – and no one assumes anymore that he isn’t the bottom, not from the things they’ve heard. But anyone could assume that just by lo
