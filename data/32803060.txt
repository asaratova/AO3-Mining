Chapter Text

“And I am… Iron Man…” Tony snapped his fingers and beings turned to dust.

He vaguely heard Peter and Pepper speak to him before everything went black.
~~~ “Sir? Please wake up.” The voice was familiar, too familiar. It hurt his heart. But this was only a dream, in his dreams, JARVIS was always there, watching over him.“J?” He whispered.“Sir? Please wake up.” JARVIS repeated.“J…” Tony smiled, sadly. “I miss you, buddy. I hope that wherever you are, things are going good for you.”“No, Sir, they are not.” JARVIS said. “Please open your eyes.”“Don’t wanna, J.” Tony whined.“Please, Sir.”Tony reluctantly opened his eyes and immediately screwed them closed. “Oh, fuck me…” This wasn’t a dream, it was a nightmare, he was in his room in his father’s New York mansion.“I believe we have a problem, Sir.” JARVIS said.Tony sighed and let his head roll to his right, in the direction that JARVIS’ voice was coming from, before he forced his eyes open again.“As I said, Sir, I believe we have a problem.” JARVIS’ voice came from a speaker on the Mk 85.“What seems to be the problem, J?” Tony asked, still feeling slightly confused.“This suit’s specifications, as stored in its data-banks, say it was created in August 2022.” JARVIS said.“Yeah… and?”“And, Sir… my last data-byte was recorded on the 21st of May…”“Yeah…?” “2015, Sir.” JARVIS stated clearly.Tony blinked and thought about that, absently climbing to his feet and entering the room’s adjoining bathroom. He distractedly emptied his bladder and washed his hands, turning from the basin to face towards the bedroom. He took one step and froze.Slowly he turned back to the basin, his eyes focused solely on the mirror above the vanity.“Oh, fuck me sideways…” He gasped, nearly silently, before his head snapped around and he darted back into the bedroom.“JARVIS?”“Sir, as I stated-”“Stop.” Tony looked at the Mk 85 and JARVIS fell silent. “What is the last thing you recall?”“Blue lightening, Sir.” JARVIS replied. “A funnel of blue lightening.”“Right…” That wasn’t what Tony was after. “And before that, what was I working on?”“The sceptre, Sir.” There was a hint of alarm in JARVIS’ voice. “It accessed my system and took control of the Ultron program. We need to disable it!” The alarm grew and was nearly panic.“It’s done, J.”“Sir?” Tony could almost see Vision blinking in confusion.“What was the date-stamp on that, again?”“May 21st 2015.” JARVIS said.“Right.” Tony nodded. “For me, that was eight years ago.”“Sir?”“I died, J, in October 2023.” Tony sighed. “The ultimate big bad came for the tesseract. It housed something called an infinity stone, kinda like the sceptre. Once he had all six of them, he activated them.”“What happened, Sir?”“He killed half the life in the universe.” Tony said, flatly.“Not just Earth?” JARVIS asked.“No, Earth meant nothing to him, outside of it being where, at that time, three of the stones were.”“Three, Sir?”“The Space stone was inside the tesseract. The Mind stone came from the sceptre and the Time stone was under the protection of the Sorcerer Supreme.”“And the other stones?”“The Soul stone is kept on Vormir, guarded by Red Skull. The Reality stone is being held in a semi liquid form on Asgard. And the Power stone was hidden until Peter Quill was hired to steal the orb it was inside, from the planet Morag, in 2014.”“And what do you plan to do about them, Sir?”“Right now, nothing.” Tony sighed. “I’m tempted to try and blast the tesseract into the sun, but I’m a little concerned that that might actually destabilise the sun.”“That would not be good, Sir.” JARVIS stated the obvious.“No, it wouldn’t.” Tony agreed. “But right now, we have more immediate problems, J.”“And they are?”“Use the suit’s sensors. How old do I appear to be, physically?”A fine blue light scanned Tony from toe to head and back to toe before fading away.“I do not believe that to be possible, Sir.” JARVIS said.“And I would have agreed, until just recently.”“What happened… recently?”Tony paced back and forth across the room. “Hank Pym was working on a size altering system, it uses something he called ‘Pym particles’ to access the ‘quantum realm’. Time in the realm travels differently to time outside it. Steve, Nat and Lang came to me because they wanted something to allow them to manipulate the realm for time travel, after we lost to Thanos. One of the side effects I found while I was going through their data, was age alteration.”“Are we in the quantum realm, Sir?”“I don’t believe so.” Tony sighed. “I died, J. Like… took my last breath, heart stopped, brain dead, died. I’d done something that the human body is not designed to do, I
