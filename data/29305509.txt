Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Aletris Lily Jamie Potter sat on her bed at the Dursleys and looked at her arm with a sigh and traced a gentle finger over the names. On her right wrist, she had two soulmarks. Two! She wasn’t really surprised- if nothing else in her life could be normal why would she expect this to be?- but she didn’t know of anyone who had more than one. ‘Steven Grant Rogers’ was written in a small, red and blue loopy handwriting, with white weaving throughout it.  James Buchanan Barnes’ with light blue, blocky letters spelling out the name. They had arrived late yesterday night, on her birthday, as she was sleeping. She only noticed them today. Her thoughts were interrupted by a banging on the door and her aunt snapping, “Girl! Make lunch for your cousin!” She sighed and stood, going to her bureau and grabbing her one of her long sleeve shirts. She had to keep the names hidden, or her relatives would use it as one more thing to attack about her. She pulled the long sleeved shirt over her head and then left the room. She went downstairs to the kitchen to find Dudley sitting at the table with a Gameboy. He looked up and sneered at her,  then returned his attention to his device. She got to work with an eye roll, making him several ham and cheese sandwiches, placing them on a plate for him along with a handful of crisps. She pulled a can of soda from the fridge and opened it, pouring it into a glass and setting it, along with the food, in front of Dudley at the table. He just grunted, before picking up the first sandwich and taking a big bite out of it. Aletris rolled her eyes again before turning to clean up. Right after she was finished putting the bread away, Aunt Petunia came into the room. She wore a terribly ugly blue and pink sundress white shoes. “Girl! I’m going out. I want you to leave the house and don’t come back until this evening at dinner,” she snapped with a glare. “And no funny business!” “Yes, Aunt Petunia,” Aletris said with an inward sigh. It was quite a warm day and she would have to spend the rest of it, the hottest part, outside. She shuffled out of the room, edging past her aunt, who shooed her faster. She went to her room to put on her shoes and grab a small pouch that held a bit of money that the Dursleys didn't know she had, before she left the house and started down the street, kicking at a pebble with a worn converse. She then got the idea and headed toward the Little Whinging Library, where she’d spent many days after being kicked out. She could at least figure out who Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes were. ~~~Steve Rogers stepped out of the shower with a sigh and grabbed the nearby towel, wrapping it around his waist. He padded barefoot into his bedroom and almost dropped the towel when he saw Bucky Barnes sitting in a chair in the corner of the large room. “Bucky? What are you doing in my room?” He asked as he went to his closet to dress. “We have a problem, Steve. Look,” he said, having followed the blonde. He pulled up the sleeve of his long-sleeve tee and thrust his wrist out for Steve to see. There, the familiar soulmark was on the inside of his right wrist. The name ‘ Steven Grant Rogers ’ was written in red white and blue loopy handwriting. But what was surprising was that there was a second name. ‘ Aletris Lily Jamie Potter ’It was in a vivid green ink and was written with a scrawled, slanted cursive with tiny stars over the i’s. Steve stared at the new name, then twisted his arm to look at his marks on the inside of his elbow. Sure enough, matching green writing was on his arm under the light blue ‘ James Buchanan Barnes ’. “We have a new soulmate?” He said, shocked. It had been nearly a century since Bucky’s name appeared on his arm, and now, there was a new name. It was surprising. “Seems like it,” Bucky said with a sharp nod. “What are we supposed to do now?” “I think we should call a team meeting and inform everyone. Maybe Tony can use his tech stuff to find her, and we can go from there.” Steve said, thoughts going crazy. He turned his mind off and turned again to get dressed. An hour later, everyone but Tony were in the conference room. Tony finally stepped out of the elevator looking ruffled and a bit worse for wear, and Steve could have sworn he saw a bit of foam in his hair. “What was so urgent, Capcycle? I was  busy ,” he said as he flopped into a swivel chair, clasping his hands behind his head and propping his feet in the table in front of him. “Bucky and I have news,” Steve said with a glare at Tony. “I don’t think guys can have babies. Not even with today’s tech. You probably just have digestion issues, should probably see a doctor if it’s that bad. Sorry guys,” Tony said with false sympathy. Clint snickered. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and breathed deeply before continuing. “That’s… whatever. We have another soulmate.” That made everyone serious in a split second. “What?” Clint asked, amazed and shocked. No one had had mo
