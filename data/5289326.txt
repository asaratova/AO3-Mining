Chapter 1: Lazy Summer Day
    




Chapter Text
If anyone had told Lydia two years ago, that she would one day be lounging on Stiles Stilinski's bed wearing just a ratty pair of shorts and one of Stiles old T-shirts, while reading a math journal that featured one of Dr. Bruce Banner's latest papers? She would have called them crazy. But here she was. Lydia had to admit this was one of her favorite ways to spend the day. Just being lazy while Stiles studied one of the magic books he seemed to always have around. Spending time with Stiles had started as nothing more than a way to get over the fear she had of him because of the Nogitsune. That damned demon fox had known just how to hit them all where it hurt.Because Stiles did.Stiles can destroy a person with only his words as his weapons. Stiles had turned a teenage boy into a sobbing emotional wreck.( It was a trait of Stiles that Lydia highly admired.) He had done it because the kid had posted a video on YouTube of Erica Reyes during one of her seizures.That had been when they were in junior high school.Stiles could be a vindictive asshole when he wanted to be. Jackson Whittmore and a few others that had offended Stiles had found out more than once. So while Lydia may have ignored Stiles, she hadn't been unaware of him. Lydia had set her sights on Jackson with the encouragement of her mother. The Whittmores were financially well off and Jackson would be able to keep her in the way she was accustom to being kept. Lydia though made a mistake with Jackson, she actually fell in love-first love with him.Lydia's love had brought Jackson back from the dead, after all.Then the bastard had left for London with his parents. She got a text message informing her about it! So much for their Epic FairyTale Love. Lydia's rebound had been a given. The guy had been pretty, blonde and knew how to use his cock but that had been all he had going for him.
Aiden...
Lydia rubbed her eyes, sighing and wondering why she was thinking about these things. It wasn't like she didn't mind spending time with Stiles. He was a sweet...no, actually he was an asshole. But Lydia liked it when her men were assholes. Oh, not to her. That would be unacceptable. To others though? It was so very entertaining!"Something bothering you, Lydia?" Stiles asked closing his book, putting it on his desk.Lydia threw down her math journal, "No, why?"Stiles spun in his computer chair to face her, "It's just...that's like the sixth time you've sighed in the last hour.""School just got out, Stiles! It's the beginning of summer before our Senior year! Scott went to Japan with Kira and her parents." Lydia complained to Stiles. Thinking how unfair it was that someone who barely pasted any of his classes got to go to another country for the summer while she was stuck here in boring Beacon Hills! It wasn't like Scott McCall of all people was going to do anything other than make out with Kira while he was in Japan. Unlike Allison, though Kira's world didn't revolve around Scott. Kira had made other friends and had other interests besides the supernatural world she found herself to be a part of now. It had been Deaton who suggested that Scott should go with them on their vacation to Japan. Deaton even paid Scott's way on the condition that he see as many of the historical and educational things as he could,Like that was going to happen, Lydia thought."Allison is recovering from her stomach wound in Paris with her dad and Isaac."The first thing Chris Argent had done once Allison was well enough to travel was get the hell out of Beacon Hills. They had taken Isaac with them basically because the boy had no one. Isaac gave up any pack bond he had with Derek when he left him. Though Derek had only drove the boy away to protect him from the Alpha Pack from what Stiles had told Lydia and any tentive bond Isaac had with the True Alpha was broken when Isaac starting courting Allison. Scott had seen Isaac as a rival for the mate he still wanted at the time."Malia is getting to know her adopted father again and ignoring Peter as much as she can."Malia Tate was about as feral as you can get and still be considered human. Malia was learning, though. As Stiles once said, it was a process. Relearning to be human after eight years living as a coyote must be difficult. What Lydia didn't like about the girl was the way she seemed to think Stiles was her personal property. After just one kiss that was shared when Malia nor Stiles really had the ability to consent to that or anything more. What with Stiles being possessed and Malia barely aware of how to be human? Lydia was of the opinion that it was a good thing Stiles and Malia's relationship never went past that of friends, close friends but just friends.Because a relationship that started the way theirs had? In the basement of a mad house? Couldn't end well. Lydia had to admit Malia really did love her adopted father and was trying to rebuild her relationship with him."Peter hasn't be
