Chapter 1: ( Harry/Norman) Love Alley
    




Chapter Text
Harry once tried to fool around in an empty indoor parking lot in some building. He quickly shut that down. The younger had pushed him against the cold dirty wall pushing himself against his father. Norman quickly pinned the other against the wall, grabbing his arms glaring at the highschooler. His son just smiling cheekily with  red dusting his cheeks, not really embarrassed.
