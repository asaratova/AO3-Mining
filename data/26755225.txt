Chapter 1: Phone Sex - Ransom Drysdale
    




Chapter Text
You never expected to end up being pen-pals with the most notorious inmate in the world right now.
At the prison, you were here to visit your grandfather like you always did every weekend but after seeing Ransom Drysdale sat week after week at visitation with no one to talk to, you started feeling sorry for him. Considering your grandfather was in here for a murder you could understand, you were the last person to judge someone else, even if they were publicly reviled each day.
He caught you looking a few times, all the charm from his TV appearances sucked out of him and he was morose, just sadly watching you.
You sent him a letter soon after that, never giving any details that it might be from you, just asking about how he was coping and random questions to keep his mind occupied. He answered a week later and the conversation had started from there.
It wasn't until three weeks later that, after your grandfather went back early one day because of his bad cough that Ransom dropped into his seat before you could leave.
“Err...hi?” you blink.
“It's you, isn't it?” he raises an eyebrow, leaning back in the chair like he owned it.
“Me what?”
“The letters. Don't try to lie. I've seen the way you've looked over and I saw your handwriting to your grandfather.”
“So what? Yeah it's me,” you fold your arms.
“Why?”
“Because you looked like you needed a friend. If it's bothering you, I'll stop.”
“No!” he says very quickly, leaning forward. “Don't do that. I just wanted to talk, sweetheart. You kinda sound lonely in your letters too. Not got a man to take care a' you?”
“Not particularly.”
“Now that just won't do. Tell you what, you come visit me too and we'll work something out.”
“I'm not dating an inmate, Mr Drysdale.”
“Ransom, I don't like my family name. It can eat shit and die,” he sneers. “But I didn't ask you to date me, sweetheart. Just help us both not be so lonely. What do you say?”
“Alright. Deal,” you nod.
It cost nothing for you to tack on another visit here during the week.
“Good,” he smiles. “Now why don't you tell me-”
“Time's up!” the guard calls.
“Fuck,” Ransom hisses. “I hate this fucking place. Respond to my letters still, okay? I like having them. See you around, babygirl.”
And he leaves with the guards back into the prison.

The letters got more and more personal, as did the visits.
One day you received a letter that said yours were stuffed into his pillow because it helped him sleep to know that somebody gave a shit. That was the point you started getting feelings.
Ransom was an asshole, arrogant and gutterminded but you were seeing behind that curtain that he put up, the Ransom that was abandoned by his family, the Ransom that never found love and the Ransom that just wanted someone to care.
Over time, a relationship did develop. He even started calling you from the prison just to hear your voice when you were away from him on the contraband phone he'd had smuggled in.
“Hey beautiful,” you hear his greeting one day whilst you were moving around the house, cleaning up some things as you went. “What are you doing?”
“Just cleaning,” you answer.
“Oh yeah? Why am I imagining a little french maid's outfit?”
“Because you're a pervert,” you laugh. “If you actually want to know, I'm wearing one of your shirts and only one of your shirts.”
Ransom had arranged for some of his things to go to your house so you could feel close to him when he wasn't there...at least that's what he told you. You were sure it was a possessive thing.
“Oh fuck, I'm gonna get so hard thinking about that. Absolutely nothing underneath it?”
“Nope,” you giggle.
“I would love to see that. God I can't wait for the day I can explore you. Fuck, even the day I can see you naked in front of me. Oh sweetheart, I have a big problem now.”
“You do?”
“Uh huh and you caused it. You need to atone, babygirl. Sit down for me, spread your legs.”
“Ransom, you-”
“-No, no excuses. Do it. I want to get off to you.”
“You've got people all around you!”
“I know how to be quiet. Now get to it.”
“You're so bossy,” you huff, dropping onto the couch.
“Yeah you love it, sweetheart,” he chuckles on the other end and you hear rustling. “Don't deny it. Now run your fingers up your thighs and up to your pussy.”
You obey, letting him hear the little noises, the little gasp as you do so.
“Oh that's it. Start stroking up and down, gather all the wetness for me. Are you doing it?”
“Yeah,” you purr as your fingers skate down your slick folds.
“Put me on speaker, rest the phone on your thighs. I wanna hear it. I wanna hear how much you want me.”
You do as he asks, now able to use both of your hands.
“Slip some fingers inside yourself, fuck yourself slowly and imagine it's me. Imagine I'm there and I'm right in front of you. Let me hear you.”
The moans start soon after as your fingers sink into your soaked pussy, obscene sounds easily heard as you thrust them in and out languidly. From Ransom's end there's a
