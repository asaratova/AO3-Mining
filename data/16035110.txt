Chapter 1: The Woman in the Background
    




Chapter Text
Tony hadn’t been overly happy at the prospect of getting a kid involved. But as Rogers made this worse and worse, it looked like he’d have to. Then, he noticed something. In every film of the kid, so far, there was always someone in the background. It wasn’t something anyone else would notice, in each video it was shown pretty quickly – and he’d had to use his own tech to identify the person – but a woman stood there, arms folded and watching.She was around enough for Tony to suspect she was some kind of mentor or guardian to the kid.So, instead of visiting the underage Peter Parker, Tony went to see Lennie Alice.Lennie Alice lived in the ancestral mansion of her late husband. Beyond that, even FRIDAY had trouble finding the rest of it. It seemed, through some means, her ageing had been decelerated. She also seemed to associate with a lot of masked heroes and vigilantes. Tony didn’t know why that made hope bloom in his chest.When he drove up to the gate, he expected to have to use the intercom. Instead, the gate opened up immediately. Unsure, but curious, Tony drove in. As he pulled up in front of the building, he saw Lennie Alice waiting for him. She had long medium brown hair and looked to be somewhere in her 30s. She was dressed casually and didn’t seem at all surprised to see Tony Stark paying her a visit.‘How did you know I was coming?’ Tony asked as he got out of his car.‘I can see the future,’ Lennie said. ‘I know what’s going to happen and I know what you’re here for. But this is not the place for such a conversation.’ She opened her front door and gestured for him to follow him in. ‘I’ve gotta say, I do appreciate you coming here rather than your first option. Spidey’s sense of responsibility is overblown as it is.’‘Really?’ Tony asked. ‘Why?’Lennie paused. ‘He got his powers when he was bitten by a radioactive spider on a class field trip. Shortly after, he deliberately ignored a cry for help and let an armed robbed run past him.’‘Well, that wasn’t his job,’ Tony said. ‘Especially if the robber was armed.’‘Which is what I keep saying,’ Lennie remarked. ‘Anyway, in one of those events where it looks like the universe is out to get you, that same robber ended up shooting his uncle dead.’ She shrugged. ‘Kid’s an orphan. His aunt and uncle are practically his parents.’ She went on. ‘He got the idea from it that if he doesn’t intervene in crimes and the criminals get away, things like that would happen again.’Tony pressed his lips together. What had happened that night was a coincidence. A tragic coincidence, but a coincidence nonetheless. And an unlikely one at that. But a kid wouldn’t see it that way. If that was how easily the Spider-kid took on responsibility, then Lennie was right. Keeping him away from this shit-show was the best option.‘How do you see the future?’ Tony asked, following her into what seemed to be a dining room.‘An enhancement that utilises the science of cause and effect. When I see visions, I see every alternative. I then have to use balance of probability to work out which is the correct scenario.’‘So it is fallible?’‘Yes, but I’ve been using it for over half a century now. I’m not saying I don’t make mistakes. They’re just few and far between because I keep most of my visions to myself.’It hit Tony. ‘So, your powers are like that movie, Minority Report, but you’re the computer?’‘Yeah,’ Lennie said. ‘Actually, that’s probably the most accurate depiction I’ve ever seen of what happens when a seer jumps the gun.’Which made her powers very dangerous, if you thought about it. ‘How much training have you had?’‘I trained them for ten years before I let myself onto the field. The last thing anyone needs is an undertrained enhanced running amok.’ She walked over and handed him a cup of coffee. ‘Which brings us to the point of your visit.’‘Yeah,’ Tony said. ‘I’m hoping to bring them in peacefully.’‘They won’t come peacefully,’ Lennie immediately said. ‘Because this isn’t about the Accords – that’s just Rogers’ excuse. It’s about getting Barnes out of trouble for his years of assassinations as the Winter Soldier.’ Her eyes narrowed. ‘I hate to tell you but Rogers is spoiling for a fight. He’s going to force a physical conflict because that’s the only way he knows how to deal with his problems. I mean, come on. When was the last time you saw him seriously try to talk out a problem?’Tony paused and considered that. It was true. Rogers was known for his speeches, but those all seemed generally to be intended to intimidate whoever he was fighting or to get the Avengers into the fight. But he never tried to reason with anyone. In fact, he shut down all reasoning as fast as he could. Just look how he handled the Accords discussion – he ignored it.Lennie nodded. ‘He’s bringing in Barton, Maximoff, and Scott Lang.’ She then lifted a finger, held it a moment and then pointed.Tony’s phone rang. He hesitated before answering it. And he was
