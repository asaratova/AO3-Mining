After he woke up, SHIELD decided he needed an apartment near headquarters.It was small, little more than a place to lay his head, but it did come equipped with a television.He wasn’t sure that was necessarily a good thing.
“The controversial Submissive rights bill seems destined to die on the Senate floor, with Republicans vowing to block it any way they can.”

“Really, what does this bill offer them that they don’t already have?  You don’t hear Switches complaining.”

“Switches are afforded the same rights as Dominants, they have nothing to complain about.”

“If you think they’re treated any better than Submissives in relation to Dominants, you’re deluding yourself.”

“But isn’t that the natural order of things?  Dominants are meant to be the leaders and protectors.”
Steve flicked the screen off in disgust.Honestly, it had taken him a couple of months to realize things had changed so much. He’d gone under in a world based on the idea that Dominants protected and treasured Submissives.  They trained at pleasure houses for that very purpose, learning to master their own pleasure and recognize the needs of their future Submissives.There had been restrictions, of course, on what Subs were allowed to do.  Parents or Guardians had final say on their pairings. High-stress jobs were out of the question, for the Subs’ own good.  In fact, Steve could probably count on both hands the number of Submissives he’d even seen after Project Rebirth.Of those, only Peggy--beautiful, sassy Peggy--had been in combat.In this new world, he’d seen collared Submissives in smart business suits, confidently walking into office buildings like they belonged there.  He supposed they did.When he’d gone under, Switches were a concept that was just beginning to be realized.  Now, he’d heard, they were an accepted third classification, easily 20% of the population.But despite all the changes he’d seen, any time he asked someone about how things worked between Doms, Switches and Subs in the modern world, the person shied away from a straight answer.  Two months later, he knew something massive had changed in the past 70 years, but he didn’t quite know what.So when Nick Fury talked to him about the possibility of working with a team, it was a welcome distraction.Steve frowned thoughtfully as he looked over the profiles.  “Who am I working with?”“Three Doms, a Switch and a Sub.  Each with unique abilities detailed in their profiles.  There are other recruitment options later if we choose to expand.”Steve raised an eyebrow.  “You sure putting a Sub on this is a good idea?”“The world has changed, Captain.  Subs are still fighting for equal rights in some areas, but they’ve come a long way.  You might find they surprise you.”“I didn’t mean it that way.  Most just didn’t have the temperament for combat.”  He sighed, looking down at the folder again.Fury snorted.  “I’d advise you not to tell this particular Sub that.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Project Rebirth had made Steve an Alpha Dom.It put him a step above other Dominants and would have made him the leader of the pack when man was still hunting his meals.  As far as Steve could tell, it just meant he won every pissing match before it ever got started.  On the front lines, at least, it had saved him the time of having to establish a pecking order.He wasn’t sure if it was a benefit or a side-effect, but he’d also developed what Howard called a classification trigger.  Everyone he met from that point on had tripped the trigger in some way, allowing him to tell Doms from Subs from--though he didn’t realize what it meant at the time--Switches.It usually proved accurate;  Howard himself had consistently registered as a Switch despite being an obvious Dom, but that was the only error Steve knew of so far.Every Submissive he met recognized his Alpha Dom status as soon as he entered.  In the early days, it had made him blush when every Sub in the room instinctively glanced his way.  Even the collared ones couldn’t help themselves.The Doms had reacted too, mostly with threat assessments, wondering if Steve intended to make a play for their Sub and knowing they couldn’t stop him if he did.  That usually ended with the other Dom looking away in acknowledgement of Steve’s Alpha status.Tony Stark did neither.Steve ran across his teammate somewhat accidentally the day before they were set to meet as a team. Stark was lounging on one of the couches in the lounge SHIELD had set aside for the fledgling Avengers, reading something from his tablet.  He ignored Steve’s entrance completely, even when the super soldier frowned and walked over.  “I’m Steve. Steve Rogers.”Stark still didn’t look up.  “Captain America.  I know.”Undeterred, Steve pressed on.  “You’re Tony Stark, right?”“That’s what they call me, yes.”  This time, hazel eyes flicked up, passing over him carelessly.  “Something I can help you with?”“I wanted to introduce my
