(hacker voice) I’m in: he has his stark internship
Fastest Man Alive: uhhuh, ‘stark internship’ like that bullshit is real

 Bon Jovi: this week on Midtown Unsolved we are discussing the mystery: who is Spidey
Bon Jovi: discuss
B-Abe: clearly spidey is a gen z kid, have you heard half the jokes and shit he makes? Millennial at a push but defo a gen z
Bon Jovi: big agree big agree
B-Abe: its prolly someone at our school
B-Abe: ive heard that like he made his webs or smth before he seemed to get a #upgrade so prolly has to be smart and hes based in queens and midtown is the top sci/tech school in queens sooooooo
Captain Decmerica: no offence Abe but i think that’s the smartest thing you’ve ever said
Bon Jovi: oof get rekt
Captain Decmerica: but you are wrong
Bon Jovi: how
