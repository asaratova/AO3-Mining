Chapter Text
“Ten bucks says he’s gonna be wearing one…” Darcy whispered.  “No…TWENTY.”  Bucky rolled his eyes. “Temperature could be classified as chilly, he’s wearing one.  I’m not stupid. Not taking that bet, Darce.”“I will give you REALLY good odds!”  Bucky shook his head with a smirk.  “Nuh-uh.”They both turned as the bedroom door opened and Steve strolled out into the living room carrying a book in one hand and wearing a gray cable-knit cardigan.  Big buttons.  Of the Grandpa variety.  Darcy and Bucky erupted into laughter.  “What?” Steve asked, bewildered.
