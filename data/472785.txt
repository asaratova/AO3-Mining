Chapter 1: Encounter one: an explosive beginning
    




Chapter Text
The first time Clint encountered Phil Coulson, number seven in the list of all time bad guys, SHIELD was raiding a Hydra base and things went bad. A voice told him to duck, and Clint ducked... and the wall behind him exploded. Then Clint was helped to his feet by a mild mannered man who happened to be on SHIELD's shoot-to-kill list. It was a little hard for Clint to appreciate the severity of the situation, when faced with the reality that Coulson wore a pocket protector and apparently kept three pens with him at all time.
“Aren't you meant to be one of the bad guys?” Clint asked, and Coulson shrugged. 
“I hear you on the comms,” he said by way of explanation. “You're actually a highlight...” Coulson trailed off, and he and Clint observed one another for a moment. It was hard to know how to reply to the admission – a man who had done such horrible things found him funny. But Coulson had a small smile on his face, like in amongst the fire and rubble, meeting Clint was an honestly enthralling event. Clint didn't know how to fight that – there was no snappy comeback for that smile, and knocking Coulson out and killing him in cold blood seemed to be a poor way to thank him for saving Clint’s life. 
So he let Coulson go. 
Later, upon considering that small and modest smile, Clint wondered if he had finally been compromised.
