i. the playersIt was a bitch and a half trying to get Captain America to move into the Avengers Tower, for some reason.  Bruce was first, and resolving his objections was as easy as having the robots toss a car around Tony’s specially designed Hulk-proof suite for a while.  Black Widow had invited herself over, practically, dodging the fallout from her rousing speech on Capitol Hill, not to mention her inconveniently thorough infodump which, while saving Tony the trouble of hacking into SHIELD databases to find out her favorite vodka, had not been his favorite heroic gesture ever.  Clint wandered in and out depending on whether or not Widow was there, which Tony counted as a win, and Thor had promised him seriously to stay there whenever Jane’s work took her into the field.But Cap absolutely could not be dragged from his little apartment in Brooklyn.  It couldn’t have been nostalgia, since his little apartment in D.C. had been thoroughly trashed during Fury’s “murder” and God knew Tony had put enough old stuff on Cap’s floor to satisfy the most far gone of nursing home residents.  Cap made noises about trying to be a part of the community, which was bullshit, of course - you can’t be part of a community when everybody who recognizes you gets starstruck and whips out their cameraphone.  Cap also had a lot to say about the strategic value of keeping all of the Avengers in one place, where they could be easily blown up or kidnapped, which sent Tony into a long rant about the protective power of wealth in the twenty-first century, which he knew even before he began would annoy the fuck out of Cap, and boy, was he right.Pepper told him he was trying too hard.  JARVIS also told him he was trying too hard.  And he was trying too hard, but in that important genius way where the perfect solution is right there in your head and you just can’t get to it until you’ve worked through all the garbage surrounding it.  And so at three in the morning, in the lab, halfway through a series of remote shutdown protocols that could be added to existing weapons technologies, Tony’s brain finally sifted through all his bad ideas to the good one: Bucky Barnes.--“Hey,” Tony said, blasting a guy in an all-black base jumping outfit out of the sky.  “What’s up, man?  I don’t think we’ve met yet.”Bucky had his metal arm locked around the neck of another base jumper, and he didn’t reply until the guy had stopped clutching at his throat and was limp as a fish.  “No,” he said, dropping him.  “We haven’t.”  He grabbed a knife off his back and threw it past Tony.  There was an anguished cry from the darkness.  Bucky squinted after it, and then said, “What brings Iron Man to a routine robbery?”“Oh, solidarity, superhero team-building, also I’ve been out of the papers for weeks and I’m getting bored.  Duck, please.”  Bucky rolled, and Tony blasted another would-be jewel thief.  “Little stuff like this is great for PR.  Which I guess you know all about.”From what Tony had been able to ascertain, Bucky had spent the last month or so doing solo crime busts, mostly small-time crooks, with a few mobsters thrown in for good measure.  He couldn’t get a whole lot out of either Natasha or Cap, but what they hadn’t told him had painted a pretty clear picture. James Buchanan Barnes, in Tony’s opinion, was doing his penance.Bucky had come up out of his roll close enough for Tony to see his expression, which was a mixture of sardonic and ice cold.  “Yeah, I’m in it for the headlines,” he said.“Obviously.  That’s why you’re at a William Barthman in the middle of the night with no security cameras on you and - well, would you look at that, no streetlamps on you either.”“They cut the streetlamps,” Bucky said, with a small head jerk towards the inert bodies.“And you cut the cameras,” Tony finished.Bucky looked at him, and the heads-up display registered the minute back-and-forth of his eyes as he searched Tony’s face.  “What do you want?” he said at last.“A look at your arm,” Tony said easily.  “The fancy one.  Not the normal one.  Although the normal one is very nice, great muscle definition.”“I stay in shape,” Bucky said, so deadpan that Tony actually blinked.A heat signature was blinking at the top of his display, drifting down from the sky.  Tony gestured up.  “You want to take the last one?”Bucky unholstered a tranq gun and made a face that was kind of like a smile.  “Thanks,” he said.--The deal was pretty cut-and-dry: Tony got to examine the arm, and in return he gave Bucky a run-down of whatever he found.  No modifications without Bucky’s green light.The first time Tony took Bucky up to his lab, Bucky paused on the threshold and got a weird look on his face, kind of a lack of a look, like all the expression just dropped right off of his face, and Tony said, “You know what, the light’s better in the kitchen,” and they never went in there again.It took Tony about twenty minutes of rooting around inside Bucky’s bicep to casually mention the open g
