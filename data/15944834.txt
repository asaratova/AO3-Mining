Chapter 1: it was just a mistake
    




Chapter Text
It was fine.It was not his fault.It was just a mistake. PP: Hey Foggy It’s Peter, I was wondering if you could give me a call back when you can? It’s not a big deal, just need a little bit of legal advice. Thanks It was fine.It was not his fault.It was just a mistake. FN: Hey pete, what’s up? Did you get a new number? Why don’t you call Matt man? You know he loves you best.Peter laughed nervously. His hands shook and he had to retype some of the words twice.PP: actually, can you not tell him I messaged you? There was a long wait. Now that they’d started, his hands wouldn’t stop shaking. He couldn’t make himself put down the phone. FN: So, it sounds like I should. But I won’t. For now anyways. Go on.Peter let out a breath from high in his lungs. That was all he could ask for. For now, anyways.PP: I think someone’s stalking me.
 

 
Foggy said there are degrees of stalking and he could file for a restraining order if it was bad enough. He said that he had some friends in the city who he’d talk to who might be able to help him figure out if that was the best way to go. In the meantime, he told Peter not to look up any of the degrees because they would just give him anxiety, and hoo boy, was he right. The academic side of Peter could seriously go take a fucking hike because he’d been sitting at his desk for hours, reading and re-reading all the descriptions, like a hypochondriac trying to match their symptoms to the appropriate stage of cancer.His other phone, the old one, the one he was planning on burning at the lab with as much firepower as he could get his hands on, sat innocently on the stack of papers by his desk.He wanted to throw it at the fucking wall. But that wouldn’t fix this shit. Not even super-human strength could fix this shit.Well, no. That wasn’t entirely true.Super-strength could fix this, but he wasn’t about to make Spiderman a murderer just because Peter Parker couldn’t get his fucking act together and make healthy decisions for once in his fucking life.He glanced towards the window and his knee involuntarily started bouncing. It wasn’t his fault.It was just a mistake.He’d taken the first step.It was going to be fine.  “Dude, what gives?” Little Spidey barked at him as they beat it down the street away from the convenience store. He’d maybe put a little bit too much force behind the finishing blow to their friendly, neighborhood armed robber. He’d probably broken a shoulder.Oops.“Hey, I’m talking to you.”Oh, shit, he hadn’t realized he hadn’t answered.“Sorry, just having a shit day,” he told her.Peter could practically feel the waves of her skepticism, but thankfully, she dropped it and went on to describe this one time someone had tried to shoot up the organic goods store she worked at and Jolie behind the till had made the guy stand in line like everyone else. He’d lost his nerve after a few minutes there and had wandered out apologizing.It was a good story and it kept Peter from running through the list of symptoms in his head for almost 45 seconds.  He got home to his facebook messenger on his desktop losing its goddamn mind, four messages from Ned and two from MJ.Ah, choices, choices.He opened the messages from Ned first because he had seniority in the best friend arena. Ned wanted to know if he could have Peter’s go-ahead to dox the fucker to put an end to this. Peter didn’t know how much good that would do at this point because it wasn’t like they didn’t know exactly where he lived and worked already. And he didn’t want the guy’s life ruined, he just wanted him to stop. And to never speak to him ever again. Ever. Please.He regurgitated this information into a text and sent it off to Ned, turned off Facebook’s notifications on his desktop, and opened MJ’s texts.MJ asked if he was okay and if he’d gotten in touch with Foggy yet.He fired off an affirmative followed by an emoji with bared teeth.His phone informed him that he had multiple work emails. He opened the page just to get them off his homescreen and his blood froze in his veins for a second.“Apology” read the subject line.No. No, no, no, no, no. That’s how they fucking get you.Uh-uh. Nuh-uh.He closed the app but didn’t delete the message because Foggy told him to keep everything for now but not to read any of it. Period.Oh, Fogs. Always trying to save them all from themselves.He called Ned to fend off the impulse to read the message and listened to him go through his ever expanding list of colorful epithets to describe the entire situation. He listened and agreed until Ned had to go. He promised he wouldn’t read anything and hung up. Then he called Shuri because she’d definitely be awake and told her nothing, while letting her scold him for being unreachable and boring. After Shuri hung up, he went to sleep.Or rather, he went unconscious for a bit.  Peter woke up late and slammed himself in the shower and tripped over a box outside his door on the way out. It was a cardboard
