Chapter 1: A scene from chapter 25
    


Notes:
If You Had This Time Again is my favorite MCU fanfiction write by dls. I got enough confidence for draw fanart recently. That was after chapter 25. Or is it after chapter 24...? Because I started draw chapter 25? I currently learning English. So my understanding it's contents and what is write for my thoughts can be weird. But I'm trying.I might draw more. So for now, it's multiple chapter.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
