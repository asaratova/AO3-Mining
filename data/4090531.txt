Chapter Text
Avengers Preference. {When You're Drunk}Tony:
Tony gets a kick out of you when you're drunk. You say the dumbest things, usually dealing with unicorns and fairies. You tell outlanish stories and swear up and down that it's true. Tony's favorite story is when you supposedly went to Saturn and helped an elephant give birth to a fairy. You end up falling asleep on his shoulder or in his armsSteve:
You're a horny drunk, so when you have had one too many you turn into a walking porn. You would stumble your way over to your boyfriend, Steve, and whisper x-rated profanities in his ear. He usually turns as red a a tomato and carry you to bed for a good night's rest. You would try to get him in bed one final time, but he turns you down saying:"You're drunk, darling. Go to bed."Bruce:
"Baby, do you love me? Because I love you."
You get clingy when you drink. You were always seen in Bruce's lap or arms telling him how you love him. You often played with his hair and sometimes get a little touchy feely with him. Bruce doesn't mind at all, he likes being needed and all the attention from a beautiful girl. You end up taking him to bed and cuddle with him until you both fall asleep.Thor:
Playful. Playful is the only word to describe you when you've had a few. You were fun and full of giggles and you were always the one to get everyone to play games like tag or marco polo. Thor loves it because he thinks you being childlike is adorable. Plus you are always a little bit more affectionate towards him, more clingy. You would end up falling asleep in the most inconvenient places and Thor would be there to put you in bed. Clint:
Clint would always have to be by your side when you're intoxicated. Why? Because you're clumsy as hell when you're drunk. You would always fall or trip over air, you were so un-graceful. After so many falls, Clint would just automatically be by your side because you would wake up in pain and with bruises the next day.Loki:
When you're drunk you get very emotional. Its usually anger ir hysterical. You say things that you wouldn't say if you were sober, so that means the next morning Loki would question you on if you really meant what you said. Of course you bite your tongue and say you didn't mean it because you don't want to upset him. After that all is good.
