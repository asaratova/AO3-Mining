Chapter 1: Meet The Avengers
    




Chapter Text
You sighed as you looked at the numbers on the elevator getting higher and higher, as you secretly tried to sort out your uniform. "Sweetheart, don't be so nervous~" Phil looked down at you and smiled. How can you not!? You were now an agent like your farther and finally 21, since you joined since you were 18 but that was mostly training and tests. You were going to meet the Avengers. Oh yes! The bloody sexy Avengers! You were such a fan of them a few years back, even getting the comic books which you still kept.
You looked at your dad and gave a slight pout. "But dad, this is my first day being a agent and I also get to meet the Avengers, how can I not be shy~?" Your dad just lightly chuckled and grinned. Many people say Phil doesn't smile that much and only cares about his job but you understood why half of that was true. He cared about his job to protect you. He has seen too many things in New York and didn't want his daughter getting hurt, but He has let you go since you were an adult, although you were still his daughter. He was a bit protective and wanted to know a few things you were doing, mostly if you were hanging out with a guy. You guessed at times he still thinks of you as his ten year old daughter. But you still loved him, how can you not?
The doors opened and you both walked out, seeing a pretty good kitchen and living room. You looked up and blinked, seeing the famous Tony Stark. Oh bloody hell, them eyes and that beard! "Hey, Coulson~ and this must be your daughter~" Tony lightly grinned at you and winked, as he held his expensive Whisky.
"Yes, this is ______________~" He lightly stared at him like 'Don't you dare bang my daughter in one day' look. "She will be starting today, so go soft of her~" You pouted again. You were not that soft--Damn it dad!
You froze, seeing a big guy with long blonde hair and a perfect beard. "Oh hello Mr.Coulson. And who is this beautiful maiden~?" He walked over and took your hand, placing a soft kiss on your knuckles. You couldn't help but softly giggled and blushed, Feeling tingly. Oh he was a piece of perfect.
"This is my daughter, Thor. Her name is _____________ and she'll be working with you guys~" He said in his calm tone, crossing his arms.
Thor then blinked. "You had a daughter? I did not know~" He then had a bright grin on his face. "Nothing to fear, mr.Colson. I will protect your daughter with ev-"
Tony tapped his shoulder and blinked dull. "Yeah, yeah, calm down shakespeare~" Thor looked confused but shrugged it off anyway. "You should meet the others~" He crossed his arms and grinned.
Steve and Bruce later came in, then the elevator opened to show Natasha and Clint. You were going to pass out in a second. "You wanted us, Tony?" Bruce put his glasses up and blinked.
"Guys, this is ___________ Coulson~" Tony pointed out and grinned, wrapping an arm round your waist. "She is going to be working with us, so treat he nicely~"
Some blinked at you, which you looked down and blushed. This was awkward for you--damn it! They mostly asked the same thing--'Colson has a daughter?' "Now, now, Tony. Don't make a big scene~" Phil looked at him and blinked dull. "I need to do some things in England for a month, so she'll be here to help you out~"
"Hey.." You gave a slight wave and smiled, trying not to be so weird. Steve took your hand and kissed it, even calling you 'ma'am'. Bruce just has a soft handshake with a sweet smile. Clint just gave you a tap on shoulder, while Natasha gave a slight nod and Thor just gave you a big hug.
You wonder what is was going to be like with the Avengers.
Oh, you had no idea~
