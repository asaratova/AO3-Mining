Chapter 1: The 1920's (Margaery/Jon)
    




Chapter Text
"Your father says you aren't to leave the apartment.""Does he?" Margaery says as she leans over her vanity table, artfully applying her bright red lipstick.  She caps the tube of lipstick and picks up her pearl headband, fitting it around her head and reaching for a handful of bobby pins to attach it to her curls.  "Then it's going to be a terribly disappointing night for him."Jon huffs and fidgets, carding his fingers through his hair; the movement loosens it, sending it into disarray, and it reminds Margaery of when they were children and Garlan would catch Jon in a headlock, ruffling his hair into every direction.  "Margaery - ""You sound just like Grandmother when you say my name like that.  'Margaery!'" she repeats in an uncanny imitation of Olenna Tyrell.  "Now say that jazz isn't music and something about disinheriting me if I continue to behave so abominably.""She's worried about you.""She wouldn't be worried about me if the men and women performing at the clubs were as white as she is."  Margaery turns, the beads on her dress swaying and making a soft noise.  "Are you like them, Jon?  Are you going to chastise me now?  Because that would make you somewhat of a hypocrite."Jon's spine straightens.  "I don't know what you're talking about."Margaery picks up a long rope of pearls and twists them between her hands.  "I saw you whispering with Daenerys's maid, the pretty one.  I even saw you give her a book from Father's library.""We're friends.""Yes, and the people at the jazz club are my friends.  Why do you get to associate with yours while I do not?""The city isn't safe at night for an unaccompanied lady.""So accompany me."  Dropping the rope of pearls around her neck, Margaery presses her hand against the front of Jon's neatly pressed shirt.  He is still as a stone, his jaw tightly clenched, but Margaery sees the way his eyes flit towards her lips.  Jon has been stealing looks at her lips and breasts since Loras brought him home from boarding school and her parents took pity on Loras's orphaned roommate.  He has never acted on whatever he feels for her, not like Willas's or Garlan's friends; no, Jon always comports himself the way her grandmother wanted him to: like a man who knows he is a guest no matter how kind they are to him."We could dance, sip a little moonshine, get into some trouble."  She plucks one of the buttons on his shirt.  "I think you could use some trouble.""You are trouble.""And if you're lucky, you'll get into me."  Smiling as his eyes darken and nostrils flare, Margaery pushes at his shoulders.  "Go put on something a bit less stiff and meet me downstairs in twenty minutes."
