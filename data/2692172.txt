Chapter 1: Steve Starts It All
    


Notes:
PLEASE READ So for whatever reason the url as it exists in the coding spontaneously changed on its own (???), making it so that the images weren't visible. I fixed it the first time it happened, but it looks like its happening again and tbqh I don't have the time or energy to keep fixing it. So I've included links to each character's instagram posts tag on my tumblr at the beginning of each chapter if the images aren't showing up for you (and some characters even have new stuff that I've done since I first posted this work!!) You can find them all under the InstaAvengers tag on my tumblr, or check out my projects page for a list of all characters and links to their instagram posts. Sorry for any inconvenience.
