Work Text:
It’s a hectic Friday night and Tony is stuck working a double shift. Not of his own volition, no, the blame is entirely on one Justin Hammer. Douchebag.  In other words, Tony’s been at the hospital for about 20 hours and awake and on his feet for way too long.Friday night means drunks who’ve hurt themselves in the most exotic of ways. He’s constantly amazed at how many drunk people manage to impale themselves on things. Usually he keeps a mental tally and there’s even a hall of fame in the locker room. Number one on the list was the guy who tried to jump into his apartment’s swimming pool from his balcony and landed on the spiked metal fence. Tony still shudders every time he thinks about it.It’s nearly three am when there’s a lull in the action. He’s taking advantage of the moment by leaning tiredly on the coffee machine, throwing down a hot cup of the disgusting swill it dispenses as fast as he can.Natasha saunters over, still graceful and beautiful despite their evening full of spraying bodily fluids. They exchange nods as Natasha grabs her own cup of joe. They’ve been working together so long now they don’t need words.Since he has the only good leaning space along the wall, she leans along his side, draping an arm and most of her weight over his shoulder.“You smell good. How can you possibly smell good right now?” he asks, sticking his nose into her loose red locks. It’s sometimes nice that they’re about the same height.She snorts elegantly. “I’m just amazing like that, Tony. I can’t believe you forgot. You, on the other hand,” she sticks her nose somewhere between his armpit and his neck and sniffs obnoxiously loud, “could totally do with some fresh deodorant.” Her nose scrunches in mock disgust.He shrugs her off of him, “Wow, harsh. I thought we were friends, Romanov. In sickness and in health, through bad smells and good.” He crosses the empty hall to toss his empty cup in the trash can. One of the receptionists is motioning wildly at him with her hands. Frowning, he heads that way. “Incoming,” he passes to Natasha.She frowns to match him. “So much for break,” she mutters chugging her own coffee, and they fall into step together toward the ambulance bay.All sorts of people are funneling into the ER now, and that particular brand of chaos starts to take over. Tony loves it. It’s never boring and never the same thing twice. There are cops and people dressed for clubbing milling and bleeding all over the place. Mostly guys, but it looks like a few girls were involved; probably a fight. He and Natasha exchange glances and plans are instantly made to get together and laugh at the poorly fitting skimpy outfits, tottering high heels, and smeary party makeup that abounds.He’s pointed toward Curtain 3, further from the chaos. Yanking aside the curtain, he’s surprised and completely unprepared for the two extremely good-looking guys inside. The one laying on the bed, propped up slightly is blonde and buff and beautiful. His tee probably two sizes too small for those biceps. Good lord, are those abs?He rips his gaze back to his face, in time to see slightly dazed bright blues staring at him. There’s some blood along his hairline and bruising forming along his nose.“Gentlemen,” he starts before it gets awkward, stepping closer and shutting the curtain behind him. “I’m Tony, your nurse this evening. Why don’t you tell me what’s hurting?” He grabs the blonde’s wrist to take his pulse, but his patient has other ideas, twisting their hands together until their fingers entwine.The guy smiles dopily. It’s adorable. “Hi Tony. Nothing hurts now that you’re here.” If Tony were the sort to blush, he totally would but alas, this is not the first time a patient has hit on him after a dose of painkillers.He raises his eyebrows questioningly at the very large leather clad man standing aggressively with arms crossed on the opposite side of the bed, who simply rolls his eyes in response. Yes, tall, dark and broody. Long hair; interesting and…badass.Are these two together? Because wow, leave some good genes for the rest of the world.“Don’t mind Steve, he took a couple hits to the face and whacked his head good on a tabletop. I’d guess concussion from how loopy he’s acting, but I’ll leave the diagnosis up to the expert,” he winks at Tony.So, maybe they’re not together? They’re both definitely Tony’s type; for dating, friends with benefits, one night stands, anything.“Ah, thanks for the consideration. I’ll just need to do a quick exam. Can you help me with your boyfriends’ hand?” Just casually throw it out there, no big deal.“If you’re sure,” he teases stepping up to pull Steve’s hand away and mimic the hold himself.Together, but flirty. Oh well, Tony still has his imagination to keep him company on lonely nights.Tony proceeds to do his exam, checking breaths and heart rate and pulse, peering into the most gorgeous blue eyes with his ophthalmoscope and asking the appropriate questions.“So tell me how this happened?” Sue
