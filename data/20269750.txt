Chapter 1: Captain America
    


Summary:

With all six Infinity Stones, Thanos is in need of agents to do his bidding. Why not use the stones to turn some enemies into allies? The Avengers have proven themselves formidable, so why not make them work for him? He can do whatever he likes with them and that power can be corrupting!(New chapters may be added retrospectively)

Chapter Text
Steve ached all over. The last mission had really taken it out of him and he could feel muscles he didn’t know he had, even after the serum, screaming from the punishment. A workout in his specially built gym (he had a habit of breaking equipment) could be controlled and he could always stopped when he wanted to so he kept them up for hours in all sorts of new ways to keep him on his toes but a mission was entirely different. He rolled his round shoulders to try and loosen some of the tightness in them but too little avail. What he needed was a massage and for a brief second he wondered if Bucky would be willing to help him out if he was up. The stray thought was crushed by an automatic reflex and he thought no more of it equally as automatically.Since the serum his body had been any man’s dream and had stayed that way—only getting better as he continued to work out and eat well (not that he had to take care of what he ate but the less fat the better). He had the strength to do any physical task a mission needed him to but this one had left him near dead on his feet and there was nothing he wanted more than to fall into bed and sleep for a week. He didn’t even want to stop for a shower, his clothes, fresh on after the mission, were now a mess thanks to his sweat soaked skin and even he could smell how rank he was. He must have looked a sight getting off his motorbike in the street outside, he hadn’t bothered with a jacket to try and keep cool but still had large pit stains on the shirt. He should have gone for something that was baggier rather than one of his normal skin-tight ones. Thank god he hadn’t had to take public transport home and had not bumped into anyone. The only person who would have to put up with the smell was Bucky, who had been his room-mate for the last few months. Maybe he would shower after all, so he wouldn’t get any shit from him. He could probably stink up the whole flat even if their rooms were on opposite sides of the place.He got to the door of his flat and sighed in relief as he got out his keys. So close, just a few more steps and he could pretend the last fifty hours had never happened. He had even managed to not be intercepted by the Shield agent who lived next door who thought he was being subtle.Door open, step inside, door closed, locked (with high security, courtesy of SHIELD). Steve wasted no time in dropping his bag and shucking off his boots. He took off his shirt as he went and considered taking off his trousers too; it was nothing Bucky hadn’t seen before. Barefooted he padded across the darkened room, knowing the layout so well he didn’t need to turn on the light, unbuckling his belt as he went.He sensed the intruder before he saw him, just after he had unbuttoned the trousers but as he had his fingers on the zip and wondered how he could have missed him for so long. In the corner was a darkened mass, visible only by a slight outline from the street-light coming through the blinds, so large it stretched from the floor to the ceiling.“Hello Captain,” said a deep but soft voice. “Or do you prefer Steve?”All the tiredness in his muscles was forgotten in the presence of a threat. Steve fell into a fighting stance and readied his body for a fight against whoever this guy was. “It’s Captain to unwanted house guests.” Steve moved slowly over to a lamp, keeping him actions slow and clearly visible to show he was not reaching for a weapon. The shadowy mass did not move. “And what do I call you?” he turned on the light.The figure that was illuminated almost made his jaw drop. The man—if he could be called that because he was clearly alien judging by his purple skin—was huge. He stood a full eight feet tall and wasn’t even stooping (Steve idly wondered if his apartment had always had such a high ceiling) and was so broad he couldn’t have possibly fit through the doorway or windows. But what really caught his attention was the clear power of the man; he was pure muscle, each and every one bulging and not covered with an ounce of fat. For the first time in a long time the Captain felt small compared to another man, not even Thor had made him feel inadequate like this. The man was wearing a skin-tight sleeveless shit, showing his solid shoulders and biceps, and trousers but the somewhat out of place was a great metal gauntlet on his left hand, studded wi
