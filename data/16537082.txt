Approximately 300 Years Ago
‘Do it!’ a woman hissed. ‘Just do it!’The Transcendent Soul in question looked over her shoulder. ‘But...’‘This is the only way!’ the woman snarled. ‘Your Order are the only ones with the power.’ She broke into a coughing fit. As soon as she recovered, she rasped out, ‘If you don’t do this, they all die!’She jammed her eyes shut. Then, slowly, she nodded.***Present Day (2013)
Tony Stark’s attention was drawn by JARVIS to a signal in the ruins of Pompeii – a signal that seemed to come from an extremely advanced computer system.So, Tony went to check it out.At the entrance of the city ruins, he was surprised to find a man waiting. He had dark hair and eyes and was dressed in outdoorsy gear. ‘Welcome, Tony Stark,’ he said in a distinct Greek accent. ‘My name is Tobias Metaxas.’Tony pressed his lips together. ‘So, it was a lure then?’‘Nothing nefarious, I assure you,’ Mr. Metaxas said. ‘It is more to the point that we wish to avoid drawing the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. and ending up in their index.’‘Index?’ Tony asked.‘An index of enhanced, so to speak,’ Mr. Metaxas explained. ‘S.H.I.E.L.D. are so paranoid and power-hungry that they catalogue, capture, and kill enhanced simply because they are enhanced. Those who are captives generally end up in the Raft. They’re held in total secret and with no possibility of trial or escape – mostly because it’s underwater.’‘What about Bruce?’ Tony asked.‘Dr. Banner they believe they can control. If the enhanced agree to work for them, they are allowed to roam free, otherwise...’ Mr. Metaxas nodded his head. ‘Well, why do you suppose a couple of professional killers are on the Avengers roster?’Tony hated to admit it, but he was right. He’d hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. again and look for this Raft, but right now he needed to see what they wanted to talk to him about. ‘So, you wanted to see me without S.H.I.E.L.D.’s interference?’Mr. Metaxas smiled. ‘An associate of mine is ensuring they cannot observe us, and they remain oblivious to this fact. At the moment, they think you and Miss Potts are at a meeting in Japan.’Tony let out a low whistle. ‘Now, that’s some serious hacking.’‘Don’t be too impressed.’ Mr. Metaxas gestured for Tony to follow him and then led him into the city ruins. ‘This particular associate is a technopath. It’s a piece of cake, I believe the American expression is, for him to alter the computer code to tell S.H.I.E.L.D. something completely different from what is truly occurring. We’ve already confirmed that none of those monitoring your movements understand the precise meaning of the lines of computer code.’Tony nodded. ‘Resourceful. How many are there of you?’‘My particular group? 12. The person I’m taking you to, though, is representative of an entire sub-species of human who have been removed for their own safety. That is why we bring you here today.’So they were asking him for help.‘What do I call you?’ Tony asked as they walked through the ruins.‘Toby.’Toby took him to a set of ruins inside the city and down through a hidden hatch. They walked through a labyrinth of tunnels for what seemed like ages, Toby evidently knowing it like the back of his hand, before they hit the artificial lights. The dark tunnel became well lit and the natural structure soon gave way to the man-made.Finally, they came into what appeared to be a computer lab of some description. Tony looked around. These computers were state-of-the-art and displaying various pieces of data – one included a comparison between Captain America and himself. Tony was surprised to see himself coming out on top there.ROGERS, STEVEN GRANT:COMPUTER ILLITERATE – SHOWN NO WILLINGNESS TO LEARNNO EMPLOYMENTGULLIBLE – BELIEVES WHAT HE’S TOLD WITH LITTLE-TO-NO QUESTIONINGHYPERCRITICAL – QUICK TO CONDEMN; RELUCTANT TO ALTER OPINIONS TO FIT FACTSMALLEABLE – EASY TO MANIPULATEEGOTISTICAL: PRONE TO GRANDOISE SPEECHES WHICH SERVE NO PURPOSE [SEE LOKI ALTERCATION (GERMANY)], CONSIDERS HIMSELF A SOLDIER DESPITE COMPLETING LESS THAN 1 WEEK OF BOOT CAMP.AGRESSIVE; RESISTANT TO CHALLENGE – SEE INTERACTIONS WITH TONY STARKLIKELINESS OF HELP: 2%LIKELINESS TO BETRAY: 98%With it written out like that, Tony was suddenly struck by what he’d seen of Cap. Huh. Cap had made a big speech at Loki for seemingly no reason. He had been quick to condemn Tony and what was it he said? “You may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.” Tony had never thought of it from that perspective before.
Seemed they didn’t buy into the legend.Curious, Tony looked over at his own profile.STARK, ANTHONY EDWARD:ENGINEERING GENIUS – CURRENTLY HOLDS 6 PHDS; ASSOCIATED WITH GENII OF OTHER FIELDS.CO-CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES; HEAD OF R&D STARK INDUSTRIESBUSINESSMAN.
