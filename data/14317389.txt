Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Loki is kidnapped in broad daylight.He traveled with his siblings, Tyr, Balder, Hod and Thor on a small outing. It was a bad time to travel, with Vanaheim having declared war and tensions running high.Tyr was with them, though, and surely a seasoned warrior was enough to protect them? Balder and Hod, the twins, were no strangers to fights themselves. Thor boasted he would take down any man, though he had only just began his training. Loki was still an adolescent, not yet old enough to be trained by the army, but he felt safe with his four older brothers there.When the attack came a group of men appeared at the front of the group, and while Tyr was busy with them a smaller group approaches from behind. Dressed like royal guards they easily convinced Loki to follow them.The attack is short, nothing but a skirmish, and for a while the siblings think nothing of note happened. Not until Hod, the blind brother, asks how Loki is.
