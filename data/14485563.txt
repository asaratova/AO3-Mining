Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Peter couldn’t believe his luck.  Of all the places his end of the year field trip could be at, it had to be Stark Tower.  And Tony and Pepper had to be doing a presentation.  “May! I can’t go!” “Peter. I told you this before. You can’t skip the trip just because you’re worried Tony will embarrass you.” “I’m sick”, Peter faked a cough.  May laughed, “No. You’re ridiculous. Now get going.” “Fine! If I die of embarrassment you have to pick me up.” “Okay Peter. Have fun.” Peter scoffed. Fun.  He wouldn’t have fun.  Tony would use this as an opportunity to torture Peter.  At least Pepper would be there. She might help him.  Maybe Peter could just tell everyone he lied about the internship and pretend he didn’t know anyone.  Yeah.  That was a good plan.  When Peter got to school everyone was getting ready to go.  “Hey Penis! Did you tell your good friend Tony Stark that we’re coming?” “Shut up Flash.” “Hey Peter!” Ned was practically shaking with excitement, “Does he know you’re coming?!” “No. I wish I wasn’t going.” “Why?” “I don’t need to draw attention to myself.” Ned opened his mouth to reply but was interrupted by the teacher shouting for everyone to get on the bus.  As Peter got on the bus he whispered to himself, “Tony better not find out I’m coming.”
