On the Count of Three

The force of the explosion hits Tony mid-flight, magic crackling all around him and creeping into his systems, leaving him just enough time to think, “Oh, shit!” before the suit powers down and he’s plummeting toward the ground.

Tony wakes with a hoarse cry, shooting up into a sitting position and regretting it immediately when pain, sharp and acute, flares up in the back of his head, making him gasp for air and bile rise up his throat.A cool hand lands on his forehead and Tony leans into it gratefully, letting out a small whimper, eyes fluttering shut again as he tries to will away the nausea and the tremors running through his body.“Careful,” the person next to him whispers and Tony hums in relief when he recognises Bruce’s voice, allowing the doctor to ease him back down onto the bed and tug the covers up over his chest.“Wh-“ he slurs, confused, pawing at Bruce’s arm and moaning weakly.A moment later, a straw is being pressed lightly against his lips and Tony drinks greedily, cracking one eye open to glare half-heartedly at Bruce when Bruce pulls the water away before he’s done.“Don’t want you to make yourself sick,” Bruce explains patiently, setting the cup down on the bedside table. “Let’s see if you can keep this down first, all right?”Tony grunts but acquiesces reluctantly, nestling back into his pillow. “What happened?”“Magic happened,” Bruce sighs tiredly, taking off his glasses and rubbing a finger over the bridge of his nose. “As far as JARVIS can tell, there are no lasting effects. You’ve been out for a little over two hours, your vitals are within normal range and the suit reactivated before you actually hit the ground. JARVIS flew you straight to the infirmary.”“Ugh, magic,” Tony groans and Bruce nods in agreement. “What about the others?”“A few scrapes and bruises, but everyone’s more or less all right. Tasha called just a couple of minutes ago, our wannabe sorcerer is in custody and they’re done with the clean-up, heading home as we speak.” Perching on the edge of the mattress, Bruce fixes Tony with a stern look. “How about you? How are you feeling?”Tony waves a dismissive hand at him, sniffing, opening his mouth to insist that he’s fine but saying instead, “I’m pretty sure I have a concussion. My head feels like it’s being split in half, the light hurts my eyes and I’m really glad you were here when I woke up because for a moment there, I was scared shitless that I was back in the cave, waking up from yet another round of ‘let’s dunk Tony’ which, believe me, sucked. A lot.”This is followed by absolute silence, both men too shocked to react for a long moment, but then Bruce murmurs something and the lights dim.“Thanks,” Tony croaks, staring intently at his hands where they lie folded in his lap and doing his best to ignore the blush he can feel creeping up his neck.He’s got an inkling about exactly what kind of spell he’s been hit with, but he’s most definitely not going to voice that suspicion, no way.Unfortunately for Tony, Bruce seems to be following the same train of thought, because his next question is, “What did your ophthalmologist really tell you after your exam last week?”“That I’ll need glasses and soon, probably by the end of the year, and that contacts are not an option,” Tony answers immediately, unable to stop himself, then levels Bruce with a hurt look when Bruce exclaims a victorious whoop. “Shut up.”“All that vanity,” Bruce teases lightly, easily dodging the still uncoordinated poke Tony directs at his ribs. “At least we know what we’re dealing with now.”Tony whines. “Truth spell?”“Truth spell,” Bruce confirms, giving Tony’s arm a consoling pat.And while Tony’s sure that the rest of the team won’t use this against him, apart from some good-natured jibes, he’s suddenly hit with the realisation that there are people out there who would use his current vulnerability to their advantage without hesitating or caring about the consequences should the news about his condition start spreading.From nosy reporters trying to weasel the more intimate details of his personal life out of him to SHIELD or, even worse, one of their enemy organisations demanding information about the suits or long retired weapon specs - Tony wouldn’t have a choice but to deliver everything right into their waiting, greedy hands.“Bruce,” Tony chokes out but once again, Bruce is already a step ahead of him, guiding Tony’s palm to his own chest, letting him feel his heartbeat while reminding him to breathe, in and out, slow and steady.And then Steve’s face appears in Tony’s field of vision, minutes or hours later, Tony neither knows nor cares, and James is there too, next to Tony on the bed, pressed right up against his side, an unmoving anchor, solid and warm.Tony makes a distressed sound in the back of his throat when Bruce moves away, but Steve quickly takes his place and slides his fingers into Tony’s hair, rubbing the tips against his scalp and brushing his lips o
