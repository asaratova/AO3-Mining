Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Being back home for spring break was nice. Your friends from college all asked you to come along their spring break camping trip, but you just weren’t in the mood. You were tired of the socializing and partying. You just wanted to lazy about and not have to worry about social interaction. Instead, you decided to come home, hang out with your family and just relax. So that’s what you’re doing. While your friends are drinking White Claws by the lake, you’re in your childhood room, watching Netflix on your laptop, and swiping through tinder at two in the morning. You weren’t taking it seriously. Just swiping through to see what kind of options your area gave.Then you saw it, well, him.“No, fucking way,” you murmured to yourself. You tapped onto the profile and it expanded. Bucky, 37 years old. I’m recently divorced and new to this whole online dating thing so bear with me here. I like to think that I’m a decent guy, but who knows? I’m a fairly open book. Let’s just chat and see what happens. You continued to swipe through his pictures and they confirmed it. Bucky was actually your former history teacher in high school. You remember having a slight crush on him when you had his class senior year because of how cute and geeky he was. And you do recall him being married, but it’s been five years since you last saw him. A lot can happen within that time frame. “Hmmm….,” your thumb hovered over your screen, staring at a picture of your former teacher wearing a dress shirt that hugged his body, showing off his thick arms and round belly. And then, by impulse, you swiped right, “Fuck it.”It’s a Match! your screen read and your eyes widened. “Holy fucking shit!” you quietly exclaimed, not wanting to wake up your parents. Your clasped your hand over your mouth and screamed. You just matched with your former history teacher. What do you do?!Bucky: Hi. :)FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! What do you do?!You don’t want to ignore him! He’s nice! Bucky: This is kinda awkward, isn’t it?You couldn’t help but snort and then typed out your response.You: Hi.You: Yeah, a little bit. I’m guessing you remember me?Bucky: Yeah. You were one of the few seniors that I didn’t dislike. You: Gee thanks. :’)Bucky: You’re welcome. Bucky: Can’t sleep?Oh. So looks like he wants to keep talking to you. Do you continue? Well…You: Not really. I’m used to staying up late. Because of school work and all that, ya know?Bucky: I hear ya. Been way too many nights I’ve stayed up late grading papers and writing up lessons. Bucky: Don’t take this the wrong way, but why are you on tinder? You: What do you mean?Bucky: You’re a smart and beautiful girl. Didn’t take you as an online dating kind of person. You: Convenience really. Too busy with school and work to go out to meet people. What about you?Bucky: Same.Bucky: Steve, well, as you know him as Mr. Rogers, has set me up on dates and stuff, but they never go past the first date. Sam, aka Mr. Wilson, suggested to make a tinder account and here I am. Talking to one of my former students that I matched with. Bucky: What even is my life anymore?You chuckled to yourself, shaking your head and typing out a response:You: Wow. And I thought we were having a good conversation. ;PBucky: We are!Bucky: I didn’t mean it like that!Bucky: Shit, I justBucky: Things are kind of going downhill for me. I guess…I don’t know. Bucky: I’m lonely?You: I understand You: And to be honest, I don’t take this app very seriously. But I understand where you’re coming from and what you’re going through. You: If you ever need to talk, I’m here Mr. Barnes.Bucky: Please, call me Bucky. We’re both adults here and I’m not your teacher anymore. Bucky: And thank you, Y/N. Bucky: Anyway, I should probably go to bed now. Don’t stay up too late!You: [salutes] Yes, sir!
