After months of begging and much convincing, Bucky finally becomes a permanent resident in the tower and Steve couldn't be more thrilled. This has been the happiest Tony has seen him in a long time and if Steve is happy, so is he.It isn't long, though, before Steve starts telling him all these stories about how Bucky is just as bad and shameless as he is. He doesn't even hesitate to add that Bucky would probably want to stuff his cock down Tony's throat the first chance he got. The thought brings a familiar flush to Tony's cheeks, making Steve smirk knowingly. Tony isn't going to lie, the thought is very tempting.But Bucky never makes a move.Or hints.Or even returns Tony's subtle attempts to flirt.But he doesn’t let that bother him...right? At least he tells himself that as Steve chases everyone out again to press Tony up against the windows in the common room.Bucky doesn't look back, not even once.So Tony thinks Bucky just isn't interested.And he just...doesn't get it.Steve still continues to whisper such dirty things about Bucky into his ear, things that give him such pleasurable aches that Tony finally gets fed up one morning at breakfast."What the fuck, Barnes?" Tony starts, eyebrows furrowed in annoyance as he stares straight at Bucky. "Is my mouth not good enough for you? Don't like my ass?""That's our cue," Natasha murmurs as everyone else sighs and starts filtering out of the kitchen, Steve staying behind. Clint looks forlornly at the platter of bacon still on the table as he trails out.Steve just continues to eat his eggs, big hand warm on Tony's thigh. Bucky looks up from his mug of coffee, so slowly, eyes barely peeking from beneath his lashes. His hair's a messy bun and Tony squirms under Steve's hand just a little.Bucky watches Tony for a long moment, drawing out the silence until he leans back in his chair in a pose Tony knows so well from Steve. Bucky's legs are lazily spread, one arm stretched out to have a hand on his coffee, but his other hand thumbs the outline of his dick beneath his sweatpants."Oh, Tony," Bucky says in a voice still full of morning gravel. "If you want it that badly, all you have to do is take it."Tony is frozen to his seat, dick twitching against his thigh. Steve makes a low, noncommittal sound and strokes his fingers up along Tony's inside thigh."But," Bucky muses, lifting his flesh hand -the one that'd stroked along his dick- to scratch at the morning scruff on his chin. "I think you'd have to ask nicely first."Tony's gaze is definitely blown black by arousal as he immediately looks up at Steve. Steve's fork is halfway to his mouth and his lips quirk. "Oh no, sweetheart," Steve purrs. "You're not asking me.""But I-" Tony cuts off, swallowing as Bucky hums."No shame in it if you're too scared, Stark," Bucky says, a smirk twitching at his lips, stretching both arms up now to fold his hands behind his head. Tony watches the metal gleam under the kitchen lights.Steve has stilled, watching Bucky with a slightly raised brow. After a moment, Bucky's words register with Tony and Tony immediately shoots out of his chair a finger jabbing in Bucky's direction. "I'm not scared to suck your goddamn dick, Barnes!"Steve almost feels bad for his lover at how easily Tony's walking into this, but he uses the hand that'd dropped from Tony's lap to pick up his orange juice. Bucky’s in for a surprise. He can tell Bucky's fighting a smug grin from the gleam in his best friend's gaze, but Tony is fuming and stalking around the table and oh, Steve loves how Tony looks when he's worked up.Bucky's rocking back on two legs of his chair as Tony stops right in front of him. Bucky smirks in his face and Tony's expression goes calculating for the briefest of moments. Steve hides his grin in his orange juice and leans one elbow on the table. Tony's foot is suddenly on the bare amount of seat left showing between Bucky's splayed legs and he shoves the chair back down to all fours, leaving his knee bent as he leans forward."I think, Barnes," Tony says softly. "That you might be under the misunderstanding that I'll beg to suck your dick." Bucky doesn't lower his arms, but his smirk is gone and he eyes Tony. "The way I see it," Tony states, tilting his toes up and brushing Bucky's balls just so through the sweatpants. "You should really ask me nicely to suck your dick. After all, only good boys get presents."Bucky's gaze skates over to Steve who is also now leaning back in his chair. Steve shrugs and Bucky shifts forward, pressing in against Tony's leg from his lap to his chest.His hands drop as he moves, one sliding to cup the knee on Tony's straight leg, the other sliding back along the underside of Tony's thigh.Tony breathes in, one quick and sharp breath, as Bucky rolls his hips forward against Tony's shin, finding a little bit of friction for his dick. He shamelessly grinds it against Tony's leg as he rests his cheekbone on Tony's knee."I think we both know," Bucky says as his fingers cr
