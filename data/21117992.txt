Chapter Text
the future of new york looked pretty bleak. with the recent destruction of 2% of all houses, apartment buildings, and private bussinesses in new york city, many of it's residents had to be completely rehoused. peter was one of the unlucky ones... or possibly one of the very, very lucky ones. spider-man is integral to the roadside safety of new york city (despite his recent fail), so it made sense he'd move into one of the many spare bedrooms in stark's tower, where many of the other avengers stayed when off duty. receiving the invite was one of the most amazing moments of peter's life. he had been living in a homeless shelter for a few weeks now, surrounded by people who quickly became some of his best friends. they were a familiar and comforting presence to have after losing his aunt and last family member to mysterio. either way, it didn't take long before he packed up his single back pack of belongings and began the long but worthwhile journey to mr. stark's. he always felt weird taking charity, but he knew this was different. this could mean life or death... this meant a new chance, and quite possibly a father figure.first he'd have to get over his silly crush... crushes. every single member of the avengers was tall, handsome, and older alphas... which just so happened to be peter's type. he prepared himself outside the stark industries door. with a deep breath, he walked into the living room where all the avengers team were lined up. peter casted a curious, excited look around the room, cataloging every alpha there as one of his very own heros. literally. however, all of them were all looking at him like he'd just castrated their cats. or maybe not; they were all wearing a face pulled deeply in the expression of shock."um, hello," the omega greeted with a weak wave of his fingers. this sucked. his first time meeting everyone without wearing a suit and they were already prepared to hate him. maybe he wasn't as attractive as even the least good looking of the group, but that didn't mean they should treat him any differently as they had before. he felt a sudden urge of anger swell within him.finally, tony broke the tense silence. "why, hello, spider-man.""oh, yeah," peter shook his head, somewhat comforted by the man's weak attempt to breech the awkwardness. "you guys should probably call me peter now. i'm, uh, peter parker.""peter," tony said, tasting the name on his lips. then he motioned to the seat beside him, "why don't you sit by me, sweetheart?"he must be so unattractive that the alpha was beginning to take pity on him. oh no, peter thought. tony stark thinks i'm repulsive."no," thor countered, motioning with his hand that Peter should take a seat by him. the only problem was that thor didn't have space beside him. "you should sit here, peter." the god, as clueless as he could sometimes be, read peter's confusion with ease. "my lap."of course the offer was tempting. thor looked particularly handsome today; he was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants (which was surreal to see), and his long hair was tied in a low knot at the base of his head. clint made a nuh-uh noise and gestured to the floor between his knees. "bet you'd be real comfy there, parker."tony snorted at that. peter felt the most safe with iron man, so he took a seat beside him. the moment his thighs touched the couch, tony dropped an arm around his shoulders and steve leaned in tight on his other side."how's it?" steve asked, stroking peter's arm with the tips of his fingers. peter gulped. being in a room alone with all these alphas made him feel a little dizzy, and definitely more than a little lightheaded."i'm amazing!" peter exclaimed, the forced excitement obvious in his mouth. he was hiding the fact all of the avengers probably thought he was ugly. "i'm meeting all my idols today!"tony stroked the teenagers jawline with his knuckles, nodding sagely. it made him happy to see peter get so excited. "and who's your favorite, kiddo?"peter pouted at the nickname. there it was again-- another sentiment alphas like tony and clint and steve would sling at him. he'd never grow up in their eyes. just another soft, dim-witted teen boy forever until the day he died.he shook his head instead of issuing a response, and focused on the floor. he did math problems in his head. how many individual fingers there were. pints of blood. number of lungs. he thought about how many inches of hair they'd all have combined, but he didn't know how many inches of hair they each had respectively, so he aborted that mission and thought about, on a scale of one-to-ten, how sexy their jawlines were."that is amazing!" thor chirped at his earlier statement about meeting his idols. peter could tell just by looking at him he'd be a soft, caring alpha. maybe he should have sat on thor's lap. it was looking awfully comfortable compared to his big shot alpha s
