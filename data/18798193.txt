Chapter Text
‘So an entire portion of the woods around you were destroyed, and the fish in the lake all floated up to the surface, dead?’ Dr. Strange asked, walking down the stairs in the sanctum to where 14-year old Morgan Stark stood with her mother and Happy Hogan.‘Yeah,’ Morgan said. ‘I don’t know what happened.’‘I might,’ Dr. Strange said. ‘How were you feeling at the time this happened?’‘She’d run out of the house because Rhodey told her he was going to rejoin the Avengers for their latest mission,’ Pepper said. ‘She hasn’t been overly fond of them since she did the research into her father’s time on the team.’Strange quirked an eyebrow. He wasn’t going to say it, but he couldn’t exactly blame her. He’d done his own research, after the Snap was reversed. His research was triggered by the interactions he’d seen between Stark and Banner. The way those people had treated Stark was, frankly, appalling. They coasted on his good-will and generosity, all the while berating him and acting like he needed supervision, like a child.Meanwhile, after the data dump, the only one that actually had a job was Stark. Rhodes was only a reserve member, so he didn’t really count. Wilson said he was a counsellor for the VA but, firstly, he hadn’t worked since joining the Avengers and, secondly, according to the VA records, he was a PTSD group therapy mediator.It wasn’t really a surprise. Lots of people had trouble differentiating between the two jobs. Some people even used the words interchangeably. Rightfully, though, someone should have noticed Wilson’s confusion – the VA, at the very least – and corrected him. Although, rightfully, that meant a lot of people had fallen down. Wilson would have put “counsellor” on a lot of documents – tax returns, various applications – so somebody should have noticed.Back to the issue at hand, Strange led the three of them up the stairs and to a small device that had been “appropriated” years ago. He held it out to Morgan. ‘Prick your finger on this. If it comes back positive, then I can answer what happened.’‘And negative?’ Morgan asked, taking the short stick, uncapping it and pricking her finger. She gave the slightest wince.‘I haven’t got a clue.’The device beeped and Morgan looked at it. ‘Positive.’ She handed it back.‘So what’s going on?’ Happy asked.Dr. Strange pressed his lips together. ‘You, Morgan Stark, are a mutant.’Morgan, Pepper, and Happy looked between each other.‘Isn’t everyone?’ Pepper asked, pointing to her red hair.Dr. Strange smiled sardonically. ‘Technically, but that’s not what I meant. Come on.’ He led them through the sanctum and into one of the study rooms. He booted up the computer and then opened up a program. Then he stepped aside so they could see the animation on the program as he explained. ‘In some people, there is a mutation on the 23rd pair of chromosomes – specifically, the part of it generally inherited from the father.’ He illustrated the point on the diagram he had up.‘And that’s what’s happened to me?’ Morgan asked.‘Yes,’ Strange said. ‘This mutation gives you natural powers. Yours, I think, based on the effect on the lake, would be electricity-based.’Morgan frowned for a moment, then realisation dawned on her face. ‘Oh, the fish! Water conducts electricity, so an electric shock hitting a lake would be conducted through the whole body of water and kill everything in it not equipped to deal with it.’‘Precisely.’‘So is this the next step in evolution or something?’ Happy asked. ‘Cause if it’s a mutation...’ He waved a hand.‘Most likely,’ Dr. Strange said. ‘The Order has detected a steady increase in mutant births over the years.’‘Then why have we never heard of them?’ Pepper asked.‘Well, according to Order records, mutants have always suffered the worst of xenophobic fear. The most prevalent theory for this is based on the fact that other minorities could be set upon and were very limited in what they could do to defend themselves. Mutants, who each had different powers, were not limited in this way. Therefore, they were less of “a smear on society”, so to speak and more of a threat.’Happy nodded. ‘So, eventually, they found a way to conceal their existence.’‘Not them,’ Strange said. ‘We did. We propagated the idea that mutants were just a myth in the same way that witches, as in the medieval understanding of them, were not real. We made the idea that someone could be born with powers a preposterous notion.’Pepper frowned and took a hold of Morgan’s shoulders. ‘What did people do to mutants?’‘Killed them,’ Strange said. ‘Beat them to death. Entire cities would be sacked and destroyed because it was found there was one mutant living among them. The worst of it was the most mutants attacked were attacked because of how their powers manifested – in the early stages of puberty and in response to an emotional outburst.’Pepper looked down at her daughter for
