"Exactly what part of 'let the nice spies be paranoid in peace' did you interpret as 'lets invite Nick Fury over and have an honest and frank discussion with him'? No, really. I want to know. Explain to me this logic."Pepper paused just before the doorway, blinking a little, as Tony's voice echoed out of the test lab. She paused, and peered cautiously around the door frame. Dignity be damned. Sometimes, especially with Tony, you needed to have an idea where you were walking before you went and stepped in it.Coming home to Tony standing in the middle of a lab floor ranting at JARVIS was not particularly unusual. (Neither, it must be said, was coming home to a building that had been recently assaulted, again. Not anymore, at least. She was beginning to realise that this was genuinely just her life now). Tony was usually more patient with JARVIS than he was with ... well, just about anyone else. But there had been moments, over the years.It wasn't usually because of something JARVIS had done, though. Tony mostly ranted at JARVIS because of things JARVIS was refusing to do.Add in Bruce standing off to one side, his arms crossed protectively in front of him and an expression somewhere between amusement and real worry, and Dummy, bent as low as he could possibly go, whirring gently in concern from his hiding place behind Bruce, and it was not, in fact, the usual picture."It seemed the most prudent thing to do, sir," JARVIS said, coolly. Cool as in, 'I am resisting the urge to verbally eviscerate you for being an idiot, sir'. Not so much an explanation as an ultimatum. Pepper blinked a little more.Honestly. She left them alone for four days to take care of business in LA. Four. And she came back to a Tower undergoing clean-up, SHIELD agents wandering around the place looking weirdly nervous, and Tony actually having a stand-up fight with JARVIS in the lab.Rhodey was right. You took your eyes off Tony for five minutes ..."... JARVIS." Tony stopped, wiped a hand over his mouth, glaring absently at the ceiling. Tony, Pepper knew, unlike everyone else, actually was looking directly at JARVIS' hidden cameras. "JARVIS, you know who Fury is. You know what he is. How ... Prudent? Seriously? How did that seem prudent to you?""It is precisely because of that knowledge that it seemed so, sir," JARVIS answered. Less snittily, now. Gently, like he was trying to coax Tony around. Like logic would prevail, if only he was persistent enough. "Sir. Dealing with entities like myself is quite literally Director Fury's duty. And judging by his track record ... he has not been particularly heavy-handed in the execution of that duty. Otherwise, I suspect Master Bruce would not be standing here listening to us."Oh. Oh.Silently, still in the corridor, Pepper lifted a hand to her mouth. Feeling the whisper of fear settle in her stomach. She had an idea, now, what was happening. She had an idea, with that, why Tony looked to be hovering just on the edge of panic.Not, she thought distantly, without reason. Oh, JARVIS. What did you do?Tony shook his head, flinching a little from the sight of Bruce out of the corner of his eye. From the placid, contemplative look on Bruce's face. Noncommittal. Bruce didn't visibly make decisions until he had to. But contemplative. As though JARVIS might, possibly, we're not sure yet, have a point. Thoughtful, considering.Tony, not so much. Desperate, more like. Panicky."JARVIS. Buddy. Okay, so Fury doesn't swing the hammer until he's pushed. Fine. We can give him that much. But. If he doesn't know the facts, then he can't swing it. I mean, Clint, reporting, yes, fine, but ... We're giving interviews, now? We're answering questions, now? We're inviting Fury around, now? Really? We're really doing this?"JARVIS hesitated, a little. "Suspicions, left unchecked, tend to breed more alarm than all the facts in the world," he said, quietly. "I thought, sir, that since Fury has proven a pragmatic man, giving him a concrete idea of what he was dealing with would work more in our favour. He is not an incautious man. Nor one prone to rash action. I do not believe he could earn or keep the trust of such individuals as Agents Barton and Romanov, were that not the case." ... Point, Pepper thought, watching them silently. Letting it play out. From what she had seen, and what Phil had told her, neither Natasha nor Clint were much prone to trusting anyone. Yet they trusted Fury. Or at least obeyed him, but given the people in question ... that amounted, she thought, to much the same thing. There wasn't a single person attached to the Initiative that would follow any damned orders from someone they didn't believe had the right to give them. Someone they didn't trust, at the end of the day, to give the right ones.Natasha would take an order from Fury. Steve would take an order from Fury. Tony, much though he might grumble about it, would take an order from Fury. Tony, who cheerfully spit on every military general who go
