Chapter 1: Where There is Anger, There is Pain
    




Chapter Text
Out of every spider in the whole world, there is only one species that is the most deadliest to humans... It's called the Phoneutria...  More commonly known as the Brazilian Wandering spider or the banana spider, it's venom is the most lethal to any human being. Mostly because the venom, when it gets into your body, attacks the nervous system and causes the heartbeat to become unstable.  If anyone were to ask Peter how he knew that, he wouldn't be able to tell you... He wouldn't be able to tell you a lot about himself if he was telling the truth. It's been 12 years since he's had a somewhat normal life. Â  If you count being held in a holding cell for the first 3 years of your life, normal.  The one thing that was different back then was that he had his mother right beside him... The memories are still a little bit foggy but he can remember the important parts of it. He remembers his mother telling him to never give up, to endure, he remembers how she held him and wouldn't let go... He remembers when they shot her and dragged him away from her dying body... The one thing he does wish he could forget is cemented into his brain. Every time he closes his eyes, he dreams of pain, and death and most importantly, her. Lying in the cold cell alone with all of her blood pooling around her.  His mother was shot right in front of him and he couldn't do a damn thing to stop it. Some would say that it was illogical for Peter to think like that since he was only three at the time.  Actually, if his superiors found out he was thinking about this at all, they'd probably just kill him to be rid of the trouble that he'd cause.  But to this day, even after it happened over a decade ago, he sits in his room at the academy and contemplates what I'd be like to have a mother again. He essentially tortures himself day in and day out with these thoughts, about the what if's. It's also not like anyone could stop him, the last person who gave a single rats ass about him is long gone. No one cares enough about him to try and comfort him. Especially not in a place like the Red Room... When Peter first started his training, there was only two people who knew about him. His handler and a paid mercenary that Peter never really liked. He did know he went by the name of Taskmaster though. He hoped he never had to see that crazy man again... But after a couple months of his training, he was sent over to the academy where the best spies are made.  His first day of being there, he was essentially cut open like a experiment so they could stabilize his abilities he got during his little stay at Hydra. They all hoped that the tests would hopefully make him stronger and better than Captain America on a good day.  He also met Madame B after he was thrown back into his room, scared out of his mind with these new powers that he acquired.  Mind you, that he was still only three at the time, almost four... He remembers the cold stone look in Madame's eyes that day, not that it has ever changed. He remembers her cold Russian voice demanding him and telling him he would train to be the best soldier any of them would see, the stepping stone to the future.  He trained and trained and trained, day in and day out to become the best assassin they had ever seen. He watched as all the females silently got jealous because this male kid that showed up out of no where, this child was beating them at their own game.  He heard all the comments over the years about how he was stronger than Captain America, smarter than Iron-Man, more precise than Hawkeye, and slowly become a better assassin than both Winter Soldier and Black Widow combined.  Needless to say the other students didn't like that one bit. Not just because he was a boy, even though that played a big factor. They hated him because he was so much better than them, that he'd never make a mistake, that he'd always get praise from the superiors and Madame B personally.  It made them all very angry at him... At the age of 5, a year and a half after he joined the academy, he killed for his very first time. They were a couple he assumed, married perhaps. They both kind of looked familiar to Peter but at the time, he didn't know who they were. In that moment, they were only his mission, nothing more nothing less.  It was years later that he learned that he killed his aunt and uncle that day... He was handed a gun and told to shot the man first. Without any hesitation, he pulled the trigger and watched as the blood started to flow out of the man's head, slowly trickling down his clothes and staining them a dark crimson. He looked over to the woman and realized she was crying. Without having being told, he raised the gun and shot her too in the head, watching as the body collapsed into the wooden chair as her eyes lost all of their light.  He looked back at Madame B, who was in the room, and surprisingly, she smiled at him. Which looked wrong with h
