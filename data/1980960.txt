Chapter 1: Lost Cause
    




Chapter Text
Darcy decides abruptly that she is done with crying. She tells herself firmly that she is a mature adult with responsibilities and friends and a really great boyfriend who is equally, if not more, fucked up over this, and she needs to shower, put on real pants and deal with her life.Darcy does not do any of these things. She does, however, roll over and put a pillow over her face so that the universe doesn’t know she’s crying. She’s not really crying anymore so much as hiccuping and making increasingly pathetic noises, but so long as the pillow’s there, no one can see or hear her. She is firmly in denial land and she would like to stay there as long as possible. Longer than is possible, actually. That’s the thing about denial land, she thinks to herself. It’s always there for you, even when your other boyfriend gives himself up to an evil neo-Nazi organization in order to save your sorry butt, and it’s really there for you when he comes back without a clue about who you are and why you occasionally slip and call him stupid pet names. He used to think it was funny. Now? Not so much.Darcy is actively not remembering how Bucky’s lip curls in disgust when that happens. That entire portion of her brain is now dedicated to watching reruns of Battlestar Galactica and thinking about really cool dogs, like Great Danes who are afraid of everything and that Husky who can talk.She thinks if she tries hard enough, she might even be able to repress their entire relationship. From day one when he helped her lift a box of Jane’s files and left without a word to somewhere around day three hundred and twenty when he took one look at her in a chokehold with a gun to her head and dropped every one of his weapons and surrendered himself to Hydra. And all the moments in between with Steve there and the three of them smiling and everything seeming so perfect that of course it had to end at some point.The bright side is that Bucky still knows Steve - still knows that Sam is a friend and that Natasha would kill to protect him and that Tony is an asshole, but an asshole with good tech and the ability to fix his prosthetic no matter what damage he does to it. Bucky still has family, and that’s good. She has to remind herself that it’s good a lot, especially when she walks in on Sam and Bucky talking and the guy who used to kiss her senseless (among other things) looks at her like she’s actual human garbage. Or when he smiles at Natasha. That one sucks.Steve keeps telling her that he’ll come around, but it’s been nearly four weeks and Bucky’s doing the opposite of coming around. Mostly he’s just glaring at her and pretending she doesn’t exist. And Darcy, being an incredibly mature adult, is moping in her room and also pretending she doesn’t exist. She’s gotten really good at it. In fact, she thinks she could probably play a dead person on one of those crime shows. She used to wonder how the actors did it, but after a few days of perfecting lifelessness, she feels ready for it. Bring on the zombie makeup.She’s practicing a lifeless stare at the ceiling when her phone rings. She tries to move as little as possible (the dead, if they must move, move incredibly slowly) and puts the phone up to her face.“Yeah?”“Darce?” Her ringtone for Steve used to be something stupid and patriotic, but it got too depressing to listen to the Battle Hymn of the Republic every time he tried to get her to try just one more time with Bucky. So now it’s the generic iPhone ringtone, which is actually even more depressing.“Uh huh.”“Is it okay if I come over?”Steve is doing his best to completely ruin denial land. To be fair, though, she’s been ruining things too. Like how he and Bucky used to basically live with her and now he calls instead of just showing up. Or how she’s been kind of a bitch to Natasha just because she’s pretty and Bucky shouldn’t smile at pretty girls who aren’t Darcy, even if he doesn’t remember her. It turns out she’s great at dealing with a lot of things (Thor, Jane, Tony and Thor come to mind) but her sort of ex-boyfriend having her existence wiped from his brain isn’t one of them. She’s not even sure if he’s her ex. He’s still with Steve, except Steve’s trying to mediate and keeps telling both of them that he’s not choosing. That part probably has a lot to do with the glaring. She’d be pissed too if some random showed up in her life and fucked with her relationship. Although, some random had showed up and fucked with her relationship, except being pissed at a Hydra agent because Bucky got all Eternal-Sunshine-d and not because the guy put a gun to her head and shoved Bucky into a car so he and the other goons could torture him was the most petty, fucked up thing in the world, and she’s trying really hard not to be an asshole.“Darcy?” Steve sounds worried, which sucks. It all sucks, but it sucks the most for Steve. Or maybe Bucky. It’s really a toss up about who it sucks more for.“Yeah, I’m not d
