Chapter 1: Just Right: Steve and Thor
    


Summary:

Steve is glad to be here with Thor. It's turning out to be everything he ever wanted in his life.





Chapter Text
Being here, next to Thor, was everything to Steve.
 This wasn’t something Steve expected to happen, but it did, and he was thankful for it. It gave him a reason to not surrender himself when he didn't need to. It gave him a reason to be appreciate the littler things in life. 

 Being with Thor made him be true to himself and it had been such a long time since he had honestly felt that way. He always felt like he had to put this self-righteous, patriotic American hero’s image up, and true, he was that man, but sometimes he just wanted to be Steve. Plain, old Steve. He didn't want to be the hero that so many looked up to. 

Thor changed that.

 He dug up the parts of Steve that he had kept hidden because he was too scared to be that vulnerable, fragile man again. Thor showed him that there was nothing wrong with being those things. It was human and rightfully so. Steve had a right to be human, even in the battlefield, because even warriors were allowed to feel weak and broken.

And Steve was grateful for that. So very grateful.

Thor treated him the way he never wanted to be treated, but the way he needed to be treated.

Thor was home to him.

“Steven?” Thor said drowsily next to him. “Are you alright, my love?”

 “Yeah, I’m fine,” Steve reassured him; his face lighting up in the darkness. “Go back to sleep, Thor.”

 “Alright, my love.” Thor pulled Steve up against him. “You must sleep, too, Steven.”

 “I will.” He relaxed in Thor’s warm embrace. He wasn’t afraid to be lose himself completely anymore when he was with Thor. “I will.”

 “Sleep, Steven.” Thor kissed his forehead gently. “You need it.”

Yes, I do, he thought to himself, because sleeping with you is everything to me. And he shortly drifted away, with Thor’s hands wrapped protectively around him.
