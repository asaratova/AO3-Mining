Chapter 1: Trusting a Trickster (Loki/Reader)
    




Chapter Text
I’m dancing around in my kitchen cleaning up when there’s a knock on my front door. I check the CCTV and see Stark standing there. I sigh and walk through my mansion to answer the door to him. I wonder what he wants now. I swear ever since my sister Maria Hill introduced me to Fury, who then introduced me to Tony Stark, I’ve had nothing but trouble land on my doorstep! Oh for the days when I was just a ghostly assassin that no-one but my sister knew about. I get to the door and place my hand inconspicuously on the handle of my knife at my waist. I open the door cautiously in case it’s not just Stark out there. It’s not just Stark out there! It’s Stark, Thor, Steve, Clint and… a shackled and gagged Loki?
“What the hell is going on, Stark?” I snap.
“Can we come in? Thanks.” Tony says, walking past me into my house.
“Yeah, sure! Why not?” I reply sarcastically.
At least the others don’t just walk in, they actually wait to be invited although I growl when Thor’s huge shoulders knock down a picture frame from my wall. Loki just shrugs at me in a ‘what do you expect?’ kind of way. I lead them to my kitchen (less things for Thor to break) and they sit at the table. I make them all a drink, except Loki as he’s gagged. I sit on a kitchen counter sipping my coffee waiting for Tony to talk.
“So, you gonna tell me what’s with the bondage show or am I supposed to guess? Although I admit, for a God nicknamed silver tongue I would assume his mouth is something you’d want him to be able to use during sex.” I wink at Tony.
Tony and I grin at the blush that spreads across Steve’s face. Thor looks like he’s trying to figure out how sex comes into the conversation and Loki looks at me appreciatively. Clint chokes on his drink and then almost dies when Thor slaps his back. I swear I hear Clint’s ribs crack. 
“Loki here has decided he wants to play nice, apparently. He says he wants to join us.” Tony says to me.
“And what? Now you’re hazing him?” I ask.
“No, he says he has a lead on something we’re after but we don’t want to take him with us in case it’s a trap.” Steve says.
“Smart plan, unless his plan is to do something at Avenger’s Tower while you’re off checking into his lead.” I say.
“Exactly!” Tony says with a smug look on his face.
“Oh hell no! Forget it! I am not playing babysitter!” I cry, realising why they’ve come here.
“Please, I want to give my brother a second chance but I understand why they cannot trust him. If you will not do this the only other option is S.H.I.E.L.D and we both know they will not release him after.” Thor says pleadingly.
“Uh, you do all remember I tried to kill him during the Battle of New York and he kicked my ass.” I grudgingly remind them.
“Yeah but according to J.A.R.V.I.S’ surveillance you managed to go toe-to-toe with him even though you’d been beaten by aliens and were bleeding profusely. Plus he kissed you and didn’t kill you, just knocked you out, so I’d say he has a crush so he’ll behave himself for you.” Tony smirks.
“You’re the only one who would do anything for a woman if you thought it would get you into her pants, Tony. Fine I’ll do it.” I sigh.
“See! I told you women do anything for me.” Tony declares to the others.
“I’m not doing it for you, moron! I’m doing it because Thor’s right. If he goes to Fury, Loki will never be released.” I snap.
“Well, whatever. We’ll see you in a couple of days.” Tony grins, standing up.
“Hold on! A couple of days?! I can’t have him here that long! Firstly, even I have to sleep sometime and secondly, I have a job to do tomorrow!” I cry.
“Ah, you’ll figure it.” Tony shrugs, walking out with the others.
I just stand there, mouth open and so enraged I really want to wring Tony Stark’s neck! I turn at glare at Loki. He seems completely uncaring about the whole exchange but I can tell by the sparkle in his eyes that he’s quietly laughing at me. I go and finish my washing up, thoroughly pissed at Stark. Thing is though, he’s right. During that battle Loki did kiss me and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since. His kiss was amazing! My lips still tingle when I think of it. Which was the ONLY reason he managed to then knock me out. I thought it was strange that he didn’t kill me but I never got a chance to ask him why. I finish the washing up and have to admit I can’t ignore him anymore.I turn and he’s still sitting exactly where he was, staring at me intently. I frown at him and walk over to my fridge, grabbing two beers and putting one down in front of him. He tilts his head, raising an eyebrow at me. I sit back on the counter and raise my beer at him, gulping down a huge mouthful. When I’ve finished my mouthful I lick my lips and his eyes follow my tongue the whole time.
“Stop playing, Loki. The others may not realise you can snap your fingers and release yourself but I know you can.” I say quietly.
“Clever little mortal.” He smirks, releasing himself from the shackles.
