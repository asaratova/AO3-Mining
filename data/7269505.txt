Chapter 1: Sleep
    




Chapter Text
Bucky: Well the first time you ever “slept over” at Bucky’s apartment, he had no shame stripping down before getting into bed. You were surprised when he just got into bed like that, especially with you there for the first time. But over time you learned to enjoy waking up with abs in your face and the very sleepy soldier in front of you. He later explained when he sleeps he gets too hot, after all the cryo it fried his nerves so he's immune to the cold and always is hot. But he also loves seeing your face all squished against his chest in the mornings, with drool coming out of your mouth. He likes skin to skin contact and feels it's important for the relationship, plus who wouldn't want to cuddle with Bucky Barnes’s abs?Steve: The two of you were so entwined with one another while you slept, you looked like vines growing up the side of a building. Steve had his left leg between your two, and his right underneath. His arms were tightly around your waist, and clasped behind your back. It was almost like he had spent so much time alone while sleeping in the ice, he never wanted to feel alone in his sleep ever again. You didn’t mind, especially since he was beginning to smell like home to you. There has been a few times where you woke up in the middle of the night, and quickly discovered you were the big spoon. Nothing else mattered in those moments than holding your love in your arms.Natasha: No one was ever allowed into your shared room with Nat, and she made it very clear with the security code pad on the door handle. The room was always at that middle temp, so the both of you were able to cuddle and not be hot. Nat loved being the big spoon, it gave her the feeling of being able to protect you, even while the two of you were sleeping. You tended to ignore the fact that she slept with a loaded gun under her pillow, but this way she was always ready in case someone busted in. To say she was a light sleeper was an understatement, any deep breath you took in your sleep she was awake and alert. Although, you did find it pretty cute when she peppered kisses to your face when the two of you were awake in the midnight hours.Thor: He is an actual cuddle bear, and he also liked to sleep shirtless. (which only made it better) If he could, he would have you just laying on top of him for the whole day and never move out of bed. Also, Thor was always super cold so having you on him made him feel like he was in his warm bed at home in Asgard. But, Thor’s snores could wake the dead, and it was like literal thunder waking you up. But when Tony finally starts to hear him from 3 rooms over, and through soundproof walls, he made Thor a special thing for his nose to prevent snoring. So now you were able to cuddle close to your love, and not worry about the obnoxious snores coming from the man under you. Wanda: Having her as your girlfriend came with it’s own perks, like the fact that she was able to put you to sleep after having a rough day or a nightmare. She loved being the little spoon, which was something you could totally get with. It was rare for her to ever fall asleep before you since she liked to talk about the whole day, and the little things she saw before the two of you would drift off to sleep. Something that nobody on the team knew (well except Nat, she knows everything) was that Wanda enjoyed singing in Sokovian to try and calm you down from nightmares. It was so nice sleeping next to her sometimes you wished you never had to get out of the warm sheets you shared with the beautiful girl you hoped to call your wife one day.Tony: It was no secret to anyone that he’s an insomniac, and that he spent most hours of the night down in the lab doing God knows what. But when he finally does decide to come to bed, Tony makes so much commotion it wakes you up out of a sound sleep. So you are always waiting in bed with wide open arms for Tony, who tends to flop on top of you for his own comfort. He always sleeps well when there isn't any pending missions, but sometimes it seems like Tony enjoys being up in the middle of the night. You weren't always awake with him, but when you were, the two of you enjoyed sitting on the loveseat on the balcony outside your shared bedroom. Those New York sunrises and being next to your love made it all worth being awake.Pietro: The speedster slept hard, and it wasn't like he got up early either. After running around all day, either pranking or on a mission, he was absolutely exhausted. Not to mention the fact that his muscles were always aching to the max, which left you to be the best significant other; always giving Piet leg massages before bed. Pietro adored everything about you, and sometimes he would spend a few minutes of slowing down just staring at you, running his fingers through your hair before going to sleep himself. It meant more than you knew to him that you were always there for him through thick and thin, fast and slow. So you felt like h
