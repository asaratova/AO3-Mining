It's located right at the borders of two very small towns and due to their size, the small towns share the high school. Hiccup, a young alpha dragon-shifter, is the son of the Alpha of Berk, one of the two towns. He's well respected and well-liked by others. Everyone expects Hiccup to one day be mated to Burgess' heir Merida, the omega bear-shifter. Both teens have been fighting this tooth and nail for years now, being good friends but nothing more.One day, Jack Overland moves to Burgess and the gorgeous omega instantly catches the interest of Hiccup. The problem is that Jack is from a part of the world where omegas are seen as the lowest and most worthless of shifters, so he has no idea how to handle his new surroundings – a community of mixed racial shifters that live peacefully and see omegas as precious.

The Dragon and the Arctic Fox 

Chapter 1: The Bear and the Bow
Hiro Hamada had only been three years old when his parents died. To be honest, he didn't even remember their faces, or what it felt like to be loved by them. When he told others this, they would feel sad on his behalf, but if Hiro was honest, he wasn't truly sad.Yes, he had lost the parents that had given him life, but he loved the parents that now gave him love.Hiro and his four years older brother Tadashi had been taken in by their aunt Cass. For the past years, she had been the only mother Hiro and Tadashi knew. She was kind, gentle, scatterbrained and she was trying real hard to make things easy for them.To make things easier on the two cubs, Cass had packed their bags and moved away from San Fransokyo. A single omega having to take care of two cubs in the big city? It'd be hard. She didn't have a pack to speak of and she knew that in smaller towns, the people held together more. A small town was one pack that helped each other out and defended their territory together.The three fox-shifters made their way to a town called Berk, at the cliffs of an island, surrounded by the sea. It was truly beautiful and Cass was looking forward to building their new life here./break\The town of Berk was not overly large, but it had a good, solid pack that knew to rely on one another. Their Alpha was Stoick Haddock, a broad, strong and, true to his name, stoic dragon-shifter. He looked very intimidating upon first meeting him, but anyone who knew him on a personal level knew the man had a heart of gold. He was especially gentle about his only hatching.Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III was barely six years old, a scrawny tiny thing. When he had first hatched, their city's doctor Gothi had been doubtful he'd make it through his first winter. In the end, it had been Hiccup's mother that had been taken from Stoick. He only had his son left and he cherished the frail little boy. Hiccup held a curiosity that got him into more trouble than anything."Oi! Stoi
