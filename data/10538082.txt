To: Master Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes

–The rehab facility I am trapped at has encouraged me to work through my depression and regain my mental balance and health by becoming pen pals with a soldier. Definitely their words, not mine.

–I pulled your name from the box, so lucky you. I’ll be perfectly honest, I think this is a terrible idea, and I can’t see how it will help me, but they are insisting and I don’t really want a crazy stamp on my forehead so here goes.

–You know what? Before we start, I guess I should emphasize that this isn’t a rehab center for narcotic abusers, even though after months of these heavy duty pain killers they are giving me, I might need a stint in that kind of place as well. This is more of a physical rehab place.

–Anyway. My name is Tony. On Thanksgiving Day I was in an accident that nearly cost me my life. I broke my sternum and several ribs and they had to restart my heart twice on the operating table. Several other broken bones, a breathing tube and liquid only diet for way too long. And now a stint in a rehab/hospice, where all I do is stare at four walls all day and try not to go crazy.

–(You know as I’m writing this I realize I may in fact be depressed. Who wouldn’t be?Maybe the doctors do know what they are talking about.)

–Anyway, whether you write back or not (and I won’t blame you if you don’t because I am just terrible at this) stay safe out there. You and all the other boys making sure jerks like me sleep well at night.

To: Tony

–Well, the letter was a nice surprise, I had to sit and think who from home would be writing me at all. I forgot I put my name in that whole penpal program, same as you it was a program to encourage soldiers to look out for our mental health by keeping in contact with someone back home.  Apparently writing letters counts as therapy. Who knew?

–By the way, I wouldn’t care if you were in rehab for drugs, everyone’s got their own demons, you know? But it sucks it’s rehab after an accident. What happened, if you don’t mind me asking.

–Depression is a bitch, Tony. If writing me helps then write all you want, I’ll answer every time. Even shitty letters like your last one. Seriously man, write better than that. Tell me something about yourself at least. Are you married? Single? Somewhere in between?

–Are you just Tony or is there more there I want to know about?

–Did that come across weird? I was trying to make a joke but that doesn’t seem to translate super well with hand written letters I guess.

–I’ve been in the military since I was 18, enlisted right out of high school. I enjoy old school music, parties that don’t require a tie, and I have been known to write the occasional terrible poem,

–I’m safe tonight. We are all are. The good vibes are appreciated.

Write back Tony
**********************Tony folded the letter with a small smile, placing it on the nightstand in his hospice room.He hadn’t expected the soldier to reply to what had been, at best, the half drugged ramblings of his depressed mind, but the short letter made him happier than it probably should, and he knew he would be writing back. It was the least he could do after James had taken the time to reply, right?It took more effort than he wanted to admit to sit back on his pillows, and his chest ached even with that small movement.Tony rubbed gingerly over the heavy bandages that were holding him together. His ribs were wrapped as well, there was a cast on his left hand, and some days he felt like his back and legs would never stop hurting.“How are we doing Mr Stark?” the overly cheery nurse came in with an annoying mega-watt smile and Tony mumbled something rude under his breath.“What was that now?” she paused expectantly. “Something uplifting and encouraging, no doubt?”Tony pasted a tense smile on his face. “Right. Uplifting and encouraging. Time for medication?”“Time for physical therapy!” she actually clapped her hands, and Tony wanted to throw the lamp at her.She had no right to be that cheerful over something that caused him so much pain.“Lets get your chair!” She announced, pulling the wheelchair from the corner, and motioning for him to get in. “Come on now! I know you can get in here by yourself!”“Patricia my dear.” he managed between clenched teeth. “Didn’t we establish last week that I can walk just fine, and have no use for the wheelchair? So maybe you put that back where you found it and I can walk the hundred yards down the hall.”“Oh nonsense Mr. Stark! You need your strength for therapy!” her smile didn’t even flicker in the face of his annoyance. “Let’s go, let’s go!”Tony leveled her with his fiercest glare, but Patricia had faced crankier patients than him, so after a moment Tony just sighed and stood from the bed, giving himself a minute to find his balance before dropping into the chair.“Alright sunshin
