“Draco Malfoy?” Harry said in disbelief.“What?” Ron pushed through the knot of people surrounding the eighth year notice board.“I’m down to share with Draco fucking Malfoy.”“No!”“Yes. Look.” Harry pointed to the names on the list. “Harry Potter. And Draco Malfoy.”“They can’t do that!” Ron sounded outraged. “Not to you.”Harry frowned, his eyes darting left and right to see who might have heard. It wasn’t because of who he was that he minded. He didn’t expect any special favours or anything. It was just because… well. Because of who Malfoy was.Hermione’s clear voice rang out over the babble of conversation. “Where’s Millicent Bulstrode?”“Why?” Millicent asked, rather aggressively.“You’re sharing with me.”Millicent looked less than delighted at this news.“Shall we go and have a look at our new room?” Hermione asked, trying her best at a friendly smile, but giving up in the face of Millicent’s cold stare. “Oh come on, Millicent. It’s not like we have any choice, is it?”Ron was still frowning at the list. “Who’s Stephen Cornfoot?”“He’s in Ravenclaw,” someone answered. “Usually comes top.”“Bloody hell.” Ron shook his head. “That’s going to work out well, me and him. Is McGonagall having a laugh or something?”Harry resisted the other bodies trying to jostle him aside, standing firm so he could read the line with his name on for the fourth time. Yep. It still said Malfoy, all official-looking in McGonagall’s rather scratchy handwriting, and signed at the bottom. He could imagine her face now if he went and asked her to change it. The same kind of face she had made when he and Ron had arrived at Hogwarts in a flying car.“But seriously, mate, we need to kick up a fuss about this,” Ron went on. “You and Malfoy? It’s not right.”Harry felt a pointy elbow in his ribs as someone else pushed their way to the notice board.“Oh my god.” Malfoy’s haughty voice cut through the chatter. “So it’s true.”Harry turned around with a scowl. Malfoy seemed to have grown another inch or two over the summer, and looked more angular than ever, hollow cheeks leading down to a sharp jaw.“Merlin, they really do hate me around here, don’t they?” Malfoy’s lip drew up into a sneer.“Shut the fuck up,” Ron told him. “Harry’s not going to share with you. Anyone who thinks he is has got to be kidding.”“Oh, I see.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned to Harry. “Going to ask for special treatment, instead? Get paired up with one of your many admirers? Of course.”“No.” Harry’s hands were clenched in his pockets. “No, it’s fine.”Ron drew an indignant breath, but Harry didn’t give him a chance. “It’s fine, Ron.”Another half dozen people had arrived and were trying to get a look at the list. This time, Harry allowed himself to be nudged out of the way.Ron spoke more quietly. “Are we just going to—” He broke off as two students in Ravenclaw robes joined them. “I’m Stephen Cornfoot,” one told Ron, his face rather pale and serious.“Oh. Right. I’m Ron Weasley.”“Yes, I know. We’re going to find our rooms, if you want to come.”Ron looked uncertainly at Harry and then back to Stephen. “Yeah… In a minute.”“Go on, Ron.” Harry pushed a hand through his hair. “I’ll see you later.”Ron loped away, following the Ravenclaws. Harry and Malfoy were left together, standing a little apart from the crowd. “Oh, not Zach Smith!” someone at the notice board exclaimed in tones of horror, and Harry saw Malfoy smirk to himself.“I’ll go and unpack.” Harry said. “You can do yours when I’ve finished.” Maybe if they didn’t spend any time together in the room, maybe if they literally went up there just to sleep...“What, and let you bag the best bed? I don’t think so.”“Bloody hell. Come on, then,” Harry said, his jaw tightening with the desire to smack Malfoy round his stupid, pointy face, and walked off quickly without waiting to see if Malfoy was following.

It was a neat little room near the Astronomy tower. There were a couple of chairs and a decent-sized wooden desk. There was a shower room attached, with a toilet and washbasin. The window faced onto the Quidditch pitch, and Harry could see that, in other circumstances, it would be pretty nice to sleep up here, quite cosy and comfortable, with their own private bathroom and a space to work.But then there was the matter of the two beds. One for him, and one for Malfoy. Somehow more than anything, this hammered home the reality of it. That he would be spending eighth year sharing with the one person who—Well. Someone Harry had never considered living in close quarters with.Malfoy looked around, his lip curling, then gestured with his wand to send his trunk skidding over the floor to the bed in the far corner. “I’ll have that one.”Harry opened his mouth to protest, but then bit it back. It was only a bed. And he preferred to sleep near the window, anyway. He walked over to look out over the grounds.Malfoy opened the lid of his trunk. “Why can’t they give us separate rooms, for god’s sake?”“I don’t think there are any s
