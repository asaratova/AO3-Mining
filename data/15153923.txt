Little Darling 




Bucky




3rd POV


Y/N Stark was the sweetest girl the Avengers has ever met. She could make Hulk happy and turn back into Bruce, she could make Natasha laugh and relax when she was stressed, she convinced Steve to stay with the Avengers, even if he didn’t sign the Accords, and she comforted Bucky and got him to talk about himself-that was her proudest moment.

Flashback

”No one can talk to him or get him to talk, not even Steve could. We need to understand him so we can help him,” Y/N’s dad Tony grumbled to Y/N when they were working on some new gadgets. “I could try,” she said, speaking up. “No no no, he is dangerous Y/N, you don’t know what he could do, even we don’t have a clue of all his abilities.” Tony explained. “Just let me try, c’mon dad, please! What if he talks to me? If something goes wrong you just have FRIDAY get me out.” Y/N reasoned. “Fine, but you get 15 minutes.” Tony compromised. 
Y/n walked in the room and sat down on the floor in front of the bed where Bucky was laying. He was just staring at the ceiling motionlessly. “Hello, I’m Y/n,” she began. “I get 15 minutes with you, so I won’t pressure you to talk. You can talk when you’re ready.” She smiled at him and his head slightly turned to the side as he looked at her. “If I see you again, I really want to braid your hair. If that’s okay with you that is, since I don’t want to annoy you too much.” Y/n said, a smile on her face. Bucky nodded which caused her to jump up and down punching the air above her, “yes!!!!” She sat back down quickly, “sorry, I just Love braiding people’s hair... like a lot.” Bucky smiled and Y/n smiled even brighter. “So because I probably have only 10 minutes left I will talk to you about some stuff,” she began. Bucky tensed up, “so there is a girl at school who really doesn’t like me, so she pulls my hair and pushes me into the lockers at school. Then once she shoved her pizza in my face, I wasn’t mad at it or anything because pizza is amazing!” Y/n said, Bucky looked at her, super confused. “What, why that face? Oh! You probably thought I was gonna talk about you and you’re past and stuff! Well I said earlier, you can talk when you’re ready.” Y/n explained. Bucky sat up and smiled at the girl, she was probably 17, but she acted 6. “Have you had pizza before?” She asked him. “N-no...” Bucky said, his voice sort of raspy. “OMG YES HE SPEAKS!” Y/n squealed and danced around. Bucky laughed at her giddiness. “Yo FRIDAY! Order me a large (favorite pizza) please!” “Sure thing miss Y/n,” FRIDAY replied. 
In the end of all that, Bucky tried pizza for the first time and absolutely loved it. He also started talking more and more. And he went to Y/n’s school and confronted the bully, who never ever messed with Y/n again.
