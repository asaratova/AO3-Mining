"Do you really think now is the appropriate time for this?"Sometimes Steve wonders if he sounds as prissy and condescending as he thinks he does. It's just that, inevitably, Tony seems to know all his buttons and the exact sequence in which to push them in order to work him into a state of internal frenzy. For instance, taking twenty minutes to fiddle with something on his armour right after they've been called in for a briefing by Director Fury, thus guaranteeing they'll be a few minutes late. Stark is always late, of course, though never by more than a few minutes: just enough so that he can be the last one in the room and make a grand entrance. It drives Steve crazy, partly because he hates being late, hates having attention drawn to himself, and partly because he knows Tony does it on purpose because of those first two things.Tony flashes him a grin from where he's still sitting on a stool at his workbench. "Almost done, Captain OCD. You wouldn't want me to leave a literal chink in my armour before heading out, would you? I'm sure that your Standard Safety Protocols wouldn't stand for that.""Look, for the last time I don't have any—oh, why do I bother?" Steve throws up his hands and turns away. Instinctively he feels the projectile coming at his head and sidesteps in time for the grease-soaked rag Tony threw at him to miss him entirely and land with a wet splat at his feet. "Oh, very funny," he turns back, rolling his eyes. "Throwing filthy things like a monkey. Very mature, Stark."Tony grins, eyes twinkling. "Oh, c'mon, Capsicle. Where's your sense of whimsy? If I didn't know any better, I'd swear you sprang from Nick Fury's head fully-formed, like Athena, only she had a better sense of humour.""You're a child," Steve spits, exasperated. "It's like you never grew up at all."To his surprise, the amused look fades from Tony's face, his expression closing off, unreadable. "And what would you know about that, exactly?"Steve's taken aback, but before he can answer, an alarm starts beeping shrilly, and Coulson's voice sounds in his ear. "Captain, we've got a situation."Tony grins at him, the same awful, fake grin he reserves for cocktail parties and press conferences he doesn't want to attend. "Tell you what, Captain, instead of making judgements about things you know nothing about, how about you lead us into battle against the bad guys?"There's no time to figure out just what went wrong, here. They'll sort it out after the latest threat has been neutralized, Steve decides, switching on his comm link."Avengers, assemble!""Why do you do that even when we're all in the same building?"Steve rolls his eyes. "Just come on, would you Stark? We'll finish this later.""Whatever you say, Cap," Tony says, the smirk audible in his tone.Steve is beginning to think that, despite what anyone might say, he's doomed never to finish any of his conversations with Tony at all, a lifetime of unfinished business.~*~It’s in the nature of battle for things to go to Hell in a handful of seconds, but somehow it takes Steve by surprise almost every time. He's learned to roll with the punches, whether it be to rethink his tactics and send half his men to flank a heretofore unseen artillery nest, to order an orderly retreat, or, when necessary, to redirect a plane right into the Arctic Ocean if it means saving the world. Still, it doesn't mean he's in any way used to the terrible spike of adrenaline that accompanies the unforeseen, the way his heart tries to crawl its way into his mouth, the sudden certainty that this is the moment when the serum's going to fail once and for all and his lungs are going to shut down from the stress.This time proves to be no exception. Although now he’s surrounded by a team composed of what are arguably the most powerful and capable people on the planet, even they aren’t entirely immune to the energy draining weapons that the giant—whatever the hell these things are—are aiming at them. Well, Thor might be immune, but none of the Avengers are truly willing to put that to the test. If anything, the creatures sort of look like praying mantises, and while Steve isn’t exactly an expert in entomology (and wouldn’t Hank Pym come in handy right about now?), he’s pretty sure that mantises—praying or otherwise—don’t come equipped with death rays.The team is holding its own. Like all giant bug creatures (and, really, how weird is his life that Steve has experience with more than one kind of giant bug creature), their weakness is mainly in their legs, which break surprisingly easily when attacked at the joints. They make a horrible sound of crackling exoskeleton when they fall, but fall they do, and Thor and the Hulk are cheerfully smashing their way through the thickest part of the—what’s the plural form for that, anyway? Horde? Swarm? Column? Steve takes a second to shake himself, annoyed that he’s getting to be just as bad as Tony for letting his thoughts run away with him in the middle of combat. Somewh
