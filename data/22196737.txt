Chapter Text
Nezu was an enigma to most people.Very few people knew what the mysterious hybrid animal was thinking most of the time. However, most of the time, it always seemed that something is on his mind, which he claims to be his reason why he loves tea so much.As mentioned above, there were few who knew of Nezu's background. The UA Staff had occasionally caught a glimpse of the hidden part of the hybrid's personality: his hatred for humans.Of course, he doesn't hate all humans. If he did, he wouldn't be the principal of the best hero school in Japan in the first place. The exceptions of his hatred were those whom he recognized as a genuinely good person (like All Might) and children.He thought of many of his students like they were his own children and helped them get through their problems. Like that time when he helped a second-year student from Class 2-B when he found out that the girl came from an abusive household and sued her foster parents and making them serve 12 years in prison for their crimes of child abuse and neglect.Of course, there is one particular child that Nezu absolutely adored.He was the first heroic human Nezu has ever met since he stepped into the outside world. Oh, how Nezu longed to see him again personally...It's a good thing that the internet existed, otherwise, Nezu probably would have never heard from him ever again.He then typed out his message.Izuku groaned, placing his arm over his eyes. He was currently resting in his bed after getting injured during his vigilante activities. Because of that, his AI, for some reason, notified FRIDAY about his condition and now the rest of the Avengers are most likely going to visit his manor."Father, your previous action indicates that you are now in between the state of consciousness and unconsciousness."He pulled his arm away from his face to see his AI, Vivian, standing next to his bedside. Despite being an Android, the AI's appearance is identical to that of a human. Vivian held the appearance of a young adult male and is as tall as Izuku's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. He has slightly long purple hair and blue eyes and looks older than Izuku himself. His hair is styled in a emo cut and has long bangs on the right side of his face but his right eye is still barely visible. He wears a formal attire very similar to Alfred's outfit, except it is in a dark blue color scheme."Is something the matter, Vivi?" Izuku asks, about to sit up until his AI grabbed his shoulder, stopping him from doing so."I advise that you do not overexert yourself, Father." His slightly robotic voice held a stern tone.The teen sighed but complied, arguing against an Artificial Intelligence who has unlimited access to the internet is pointless. Also, Alfred is most likely preparing his dinner right now which is why he isn't here."As for your question, your close acquaintance, Mr. Nezu, had sent an invitation for you to attend UA High School." Vivi explained, "He wishes for you to become the first Quirkless Pro Hero of Japan as you're the only Japanese quirkless who is the most suitable candidate to become an inspiration to the quirkless of Japan.""Another one of his schemes, I see." Izuku mumbled, but he knows that the hybrid has good intentions. He was already a prominent figure as the quirkless "World's Greatest Detective" as well as being a quirkless vigilante but why not take it up a notch?"I'm in." Izuku said before both of them heard the door slammed open to reveal the Merc with a mouth."Hello, ladies and gentlemen! It is I, your Friendly Neighborhood—"




Notes:

Me: And that's it for now. :DDeadpool: HEY! I DIDN'T GET TO FINISH MY INTRO YET!Me: Eh, I'm pretty tired from writing. You'll just appear in the future chapters, anyway.Deadpool: I want chimichangas!Me: Izuku gives them to you almost everyday, you lunatic.-------------------------------------------------------------------------I might write a story on how Izuku met the Avengers. :DVivian looks like Shizuku from Bleach: Fade to Black, except his other eye is visible.In most fics, they often depict Endeavor as the worst of the worst (which I agree considering his abuse), like how he is the same as Bakugou since he doesn't care about rescuing people. However, I'm sticking to canon on this one. To those who read the manga, Endeavor DOES take his hero work very seriously and is focused on saving lives just as arresting villains.
