Chapter 1



Summary:

Okay, so I've decided to rewrite this story from the beginning!  I'm sorry for those who read the last 15 chapters but I promise my writing has gotten a lot better and the plot will be easier to follow.  The story will remain as I wrote it last time just with better writing and a more clear plot.



Notes:
The name, backstory, and character of "The Phantom Soldier" and "Howling Doom" belong to me (although their artwork designs do not). DO NOT USE/COPY/DISTRIBUTE!

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text

Okay, so I've decided to rewrite this story from the beginning! I'm sorry for those who read the last 15 chapters, but I promise my writing has gotten a lot better and the plot will be easier to follow. The story will remain as I wrote it last time just with better writing and a more clear plot.
 Clint awoke to the bright rays of sun blinding him. Damn Steve, always leaving the goddamn blinds open. He mumbled something into Steve’s chest as he rolled over, using the supersoldier's muscles to block out the sun. “It’s just a little bit of sun Clint, it won’t hurt you.”“Then why does it hurt?” Clint retorted, rubbing at his ears, remembering that he had forgotten to take out his hearing aids the previous night.“Because you’re nocturnal and you hate the sun,” Steve laughed, rising up and watching Clint roll off the bed. He watched the smaller man stand and glare at him with his bed hair sticking up in every angle.“You’re rude,” Clint said turning around and pulling on a pair of loose purple sweatpants. Steve came over and wrapped his arms around Clint’s waist, kissing his neck gently.“You love me.”“A bit too much.”Steve smiled and rubbed his soulmark on Clint’s body, tracing the shield’s shape before kissing Clint’s collarbone and leading him out of the room to go get some breakfast. “There had better be coffee left,” Clint basically screamed at Scott (who was surprisingly awake).“Relax Birdy, I left an entire pot for you,” Scott grumbled into his toast. He looked horrible. A torn shirt barely hung onto his body and large circles encased his eyes. His usually glowing smile was dull, but then again he had just gotten back from a week-long mission.“You should go rest up sweetheart,” Steve purred into Scott’s ear, only to be flipped off by the lithe man.“I’m fine babe, the mission went well with only one weird occurrence,” Scott reassured his soulmate.“If you broke your suit again, I’ll personally kill you,” Tony spoke as he walked past the three men in the kitchen to grab himself a cup of coffee before Clint drank it all.“No no, the suit is fine. Thanks for that upgrade, by the way, it works really well. But while I was out, that soulmark burned a little,” Scott explained. The Avengers were unusual, with each of them being bound to one another. Bucky, Clint, Peter (Parker), Pietro, Sam, Scott, Steve, Thor, and Tony were all bound together. And of course Matt Murdock (the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen) was bound to them as well and they had a loose bond with T’Challa. T’Challa was soulbound to them but since he had his own kingdom to run he was almost never around and Matt didn’t live in New York City and had his own city to protect. Logan from the X-Men was also bound to each of them, but living in Canda made him a rare sight.  Each one of them, however, had one extra soulmark. One that hadn’t been activated yet, one that sent shivers down their spines.
It was a black soulmark in the shape of a large demon with a sniper rifle in its arms. It had a bullet streaming down their forearms to strike a white human skull. So far all they knew was that it belonged to an anthro which was a highly feared and highly aggressive species.“Really? Did you see anything?” Clint asked, his coffee now taking full effect and brightening up the archer’s eyes.“Nothing except some pawprints, I took a picture of them. Tony, do you think FRIDAY could analyze the photo to figure out the species?” Scott questioned the genius.“Of course, just pull the photo up on your phone and place it on the counter.” Scott did as he was told and the four men all waited in silence for FRIDAY to finish.Well, it was silent until Sam and Bucky entered the commons area with Natasha following them, shaking her head. Natasha and Bruce were bound together, with Bruce being her omega, so it was odd to see them apart unless they were on a mission.  Sam and Bucky were laughing their asses off at some unheard comment, causing Tony and Scott to glare at the two.“It is too goddamn early to hear your annoying ass laugh,” Scott spat at the two (mostly at Bucky).“Someone’s happy,” Bucky smiled and wrapped his metal arm around the beta, gently kissing his temple.“I swear to god if you don’t stop talking that loud I will shrink down and ruin your life,” Scott threatened, although he did relax into Bucky’s strong grip.“Sir, sorry to interrupt but I have the results from the pawprint. It appears to be a hybrid c
