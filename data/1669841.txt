"Is this a test?"Bucky doesn’t know what he’d expected, but he had hoped for something better than this. A kiss maybe, hell, a smile. Instead Steve holds himself like he’s expecting a blow. He stares at Bucky, but he must not really see him, because the look is all fear."A trick?"The words come out of Steve clipped and harsh. The way he’s standing, big hands in fists, shoulders squared, the whole of him tense like a spring, it could be taken as threatening. Threatening he could do, now, that enhanced body of his promising a hell of a wallop to anyone who’s got on his bad side, but Bucky knows him. Seventy years and Bucky still recognizes the way he’s set his jaw, knows the tightness in his eyes for what it is; Steve trying to hold back tears.Tony opens his mouth and Bucky raises his hand to shush him without taking his attention from Steve. Then he shows Steve his open palms, friendly-like. He half-wishes he’d covered his arm after all. Maybe this is too much at once, he doesn’t know. He just wanted to be honest. He pushes on anyhow."No," he says, "no, ‘s notta trick." He steps closer, watching the way Steve draws in a sharp breath, watching as his eyes roam Bucky’s face, watching how he’s steeling himself against whatever he’d decided Bucky must be. Bucky keeps stepping forward until he’s close enough he can offer Steve his flesh-and-blood arm. He throws up a smirk for good measure. "Genuine article, hand t’God."Steve doesn’t take the bait. He’s trying his damnedest to be stone, to appear impartial in the face of this, and that’s just like him, that’s just like him to hold it all in. Bucky guesses Steve’s just out of patience at this point, and he doesn’t blame him, can’t blame him for that. He knows he’s too good to be true, its only smart to expect a catch. What he is is impossible, but so is Steve, and Bucky’s already cried himself sick over the damn perfect match they make, when he learned Steve was back again and where they’d found him. "I watched you fall," Steve says."I know." Bucky stops putting on such a front, starts showing his understanding, letting sympathy soften his eyes. "I know, I fell."“Seventy years ago,” Steve says, as his expression pinches and his brows bare down harder and Bucky can see he’s just about shaking out of his own skin, he’s so tense. “I watched—” Steve’s been trying to keep his voice low, but it catches anyways. The guilt is written all over his face. “I just watched—”"You remember Zola,” Bucky says, interrupting, because he hates that guilty look, won’t stand to hear Steve blaming himself, not now. Steve’s shoulders tense at the name, but he doesn’t nod or nothing, just keeps staring. Bucky dares another step, putting them only a foot or so apart, and continues, “When he had me, he did somethin’ to me. I survived that fall.” He shrugs one shoulder. “Haven’t really aged much since.” Steve’s lips go from a tight line to a tighter frown, lips curling in as he comes to some decision and reaches out quick-like, gripping Bucky’s right shoulder in something close to a vice. Bucky wishes those big hands felt more familiar, but he was only just starting to get used to them when they’d lost each other, and that was a long time ago. He smiles up at him anyways. Says quietly, “It’s me, Steve. I swear.”Something in Steve crumples, and then Steve starts to, too, his shaking shoulders hunching in as they lower, his chin tucking in toward his sternum. He doesn’t take his eyes off Bucky’s. “I let you—”Bucky takes him by the collar and gives it a jerk. “Shuddup, punk. The hell you did.”“Stop,” Steve says and he makes like he’s gonna push Bucky away and just manages to catch himself. He takes both of Bucky’s shoulders instead, and looks hard at the left one when it doesn’t give under his palm. "I’ll explain later," Bucky says, nodding to his prothesis. "Explain now," Steve says and he says it so fast, Bucky thinks it’s just an automatic response, so he waits, giving him room to elaborate. He does, starting to sound breathless. The tears are close now. "How is this—Bucky—”God, he can’t stand to hear Steve’s voice go so raw. His own cracks when he says, “y’know, I thought you were dead too, right?”That seems to do it. Steve’s lips twist, but Bucky can tell by the tilt to his eyes that what he’s trying to suppress is a smile, and he’s pulling Steve to him before anyone else can see he’s started to cry. Bucky wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders, fingers of his right hand sinking into his hair. Steve holds his waist, and then he’s holding Bucky to him by the waist, just about pulling him onto his tip-toes and Bucky laughs, right in Steve’s ear. He’s not sure he’ll ever get used to the height, or the strength. He could now, though. They have the time.Steve gives a wet gasp against Bucky’s neck before he tries speaking again. “The hell’s wrong with your hair?” he asks. Bucky gives another laugh."The dames love it, and so do you," he says. Gives the back of Steve’s head a squeeze, tu
