It started as a normal evening. Steve and Bruce cooked. They even dragged up Tony from the workshop and had Fury and Phil over too. They were just deciding on a movie when it all went to shit.A flash of light and thud made them turn around. Tony was already on the other side of the room with Clint and Rhodey.“Steve?” He hears a man asks Tony knows that voice anywhere.“Howard?” Steve asks gaping. “What are you doing here?”“What do you mean?” Howards asks“It’s 2016, dumbass.” Tony says rolling his eyes making Howard turn around.“Tony.” Howard says dryly “What are you now? 60? Looking a little grey.”“Can you do math?” Tony rolls his eyes “Or wait, do you even know when my birthday is?”“June? July? 1970something or another. I don’t know, that’s domestic. I don’t do domestic.” The Avengers watch this interaction with puzzled looks“Never have never did until the day you died.” Tony says with emphasis “So what the fuck are you doing here?”“Still an idiot I see.” Howard rolls his eyes“Still a dick apparently. Would you like a drink? Never seen you without one before. Kind of like a zebra without stripes.”“You had to use the word dick?”“Would you prefer asshole? Or bitch, fucker, bastard.” Tony raises and eyebrow“Wow, what a mouth and in front of Captain America too.”“So we’re back to him.” Tony throws up his arms “Of course we are. I’m surprised we even left.” Tony rolls his eyes“What, you thought I travelled through time to see you?” Howard laughs “Stupid then, stupid now.”“Smarter then you.” Tony seethes.“Yeah, Sure. Uh huh.” Howard shakes his head.“I was smarter than you when I was four. Don’t pretend like I don’t know that all those designs you took from me never made it to the trash.”Howard barks out a harsh laugh making everyone but Tony flinch. Tony’s done flinching to this asshole.“So this? This is what you grew up to be? HA!” Howard wipes a tear “Always a disappointment.” Howard shakes his head “You probably tried so hard to prove me wrong! Look at you!” Tony stares him down “What lost your ability to speak to? What a waste of space!”“You know." Tony says with a chuckle "I wonder how you’re going to react.” “To what?” Howard rolls his eyes“The look of disgust on Steve Rogers face.” Tony says with a small grin as Howard turns around. And true to his word Steve is looking at him with the most appalled look on his face matching everyone’s on the team.“Steve.” Howard says softly and Tony laughs“That’s good.” Tony laughs “Priceless. Wow.” Tony laughs “Never seen that before.”“I don’t understand.” Steve says softly“its not-““What it looks like?” Tony cuts him off. “Yeah, try again. He’s smarter then you ever said.”“Steve. Just hear me out.” Howard says softly“Is this why you never talk about him?” Steve asks softly “Because he’s an asshole?”“Steve.” Howard says softly “You know me-““I don’t apparently.” Steve cuts him off “What the hell is wrong with you?”“So you defend Tony? And hate me?”“I’ve known Tony longer then I’ve known you.”“How long?” Howard demands“We met two years ago,” Tony answers “and I think our one year anniversary is coming up, right Hun.” Steve sighs“What?” Howard demands“Oh, you didn’t know?” Tony asks fake innocently “Steve is gay for me. Me and Bucky.”Howard seethes“Tony.” Steve says softly “Stop.”“No, Steve. I finally can say to him what I want and not be scared he’s going to punch me in the face.” Tony says through gritted teeth. The team takes in a collective gasp“You hit him?” Steve demands taking a step forward.“NO!” Howard demands“Oh really?” Tony asks with a cruel laugh “You’re going to lie? How many times have you beat me for lying to you?”“You deserved it!” Howard shouts and Steve punches him in the face not being able to hold back any longer. Howard stumbles back looking up to his once friend“Steve.” Howard says shocked holding his jaw.“Someone deal with him. I need a moment.” Steve says and walks away.“Captain America, disgusted with you.” Tony smiles “Wow, how ironic.”“Tony.” Bucky says softly “Take a walk too. You don’t need to be here right now.”“Tony.” Rhodey grabs his arm “Come on, walk with me.” Tony shakes off his arm but follows him anyway. “So Howard.” Bucky asks when the 3 of them are gone.“Buck?” Howard asks softly“What happened to you?” Bucky asks and the remaing members watch with interest“I don’t know-““You know damn well what I mean!” Bucky shouts “When did you go from the Howard we knew to, to… this.” Bucky motions to Howard “To the abusive asshole that you became.” Howard doesn’t answer “No seriously I want to know what changed.” Bucky asks stepping forward.“Nothing changed.” Howard grumbles“So you were always like this?”“I’m not a terrible person, Bucky.” Howard glares “I do what I have to. He needs it.”“You sick son of bitch.” Bucky seethes “What the fuck did you do to him?”“I barely touch him.” Howard rolls his eyes“Touch? Needs? Have.” Natasha says stepping forward “As in still going on now?” Bucky looks to him“Where are you from in his timeline?”“H
