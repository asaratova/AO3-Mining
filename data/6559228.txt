Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It would be on a day that Peter has already privately dubbed in his head as a Very Bad One, the kind that really warrants capitalization just to emphasize how Very Bad it is, that he has a run-in with the infamous Merc with a Mouth for the first time. Good, old-fashioned Parker luck in action, that’s what it is.He’s in civvies, on his way home from an especially shitty day at work—phrases like “moron” and “half-assed” and “lazy goddamn editing” are still pinging around in his skull, long after Jameson’s fourteen-minute rant about a misprint on page eight that wasn’t even Peter’s fault—and all he wants to do is get home, curl himself into a ball in his favorite corner between the bedroom and closet doors, bury himself under a mountain of blankets and pillows to shut out the world for a few hours, and maybe also fidget for a bit with his favorite stim toy that he forgot at home on accident this morning, the flexible one that he can bend and twist in his hands and even chomp down on so he doesn’t resort to chewing on his fingers when he’s stressed.His fingers are currently still an angry minefield of pock marks and jagged little indentations from his teeth which haven’t gone away entirely yet, because while his healing factor may work pretty fast, it’s of very little help when his digits kept finding their way back into his mouth today anyway every time Jameson raised his voice at another intern in the office, which was often. If given the choice, Peter would take being shoved into a room full of every super-powered villain he’s ever fought over being stuck in a room alone with his boss, any day of the week. At least as Spider-Man he has somewhere productive to channel all his excess energy and nervous tension into, like punching people in the face who actually hate Spider-Man with good reason since he keeps getting in the way of all their crimes and evil-doings.It’s a bad night to go patrolling and Peter knows this, knows if he doesn’t get home soon that the day will take an even worse turn for him than it already has. He’s just one little push away from having a Very, Very Bad Episode, he can tell from the way he’s already begun to feel claustrophobic and ready to spill out of his own skin just from the usual loud, grating noises of the city.Unfortunately, it’s also a bad night for Peter to hope he can actually catch a break for once, as his spidey sense starts going off seconds before his sensitive ears pick up shouting just a few streets over. He’s already ducking into an empty alleyway to change into his suit on instinct, his own problems be damned for the moment. He’s not gonna ignore a helpless person in need, no matter how much every sound jars him and the thrumming anxiety keeps building and building beneath his skin.Half of the scene he finds when he webs his way over and lands silently on the edge of the nearest rooftop is one he’s all too used to seeing—a crying woman with her shirt torn open, a looming man holding her close with a knife poised near her face. Peter would already be on the ground and pummeling the guy with just a bit more force than he normally uses against non-supers, because it’s just that kind of night for him and this guy so clearly deserves it, if not for the other half of the scene that is distressingly not familiar in this kind of situation.There’s a third party standing just a few feet away and pointing a gun at the other two, a figure clad from head to toe in red and black with swords strapped to his back. It takes his brain a frustratingly long time to place why the figure seems familiar when he’s certain he’s never seen this person before in his life, and by then it doesn’t matter because there’s talking now and Peter’s brain needs to focus on more important things, like understanding what the hell is going on.“I’m only gonna ask nicely one more time,” says the masked figure, voice low and rough like gravel and gunpowder and hnnng, Peter should ask if he does ASMR videos later when things aren’t so tense because really, wow, “let the lady go and I’ll think about not spattering your brains all over those bricks behind you. That wall looks like it’s already seen worse, I’m sure a little more redecorating won’t hurt.”It takes a second to process the words when he’s already so distracted by the voice itself, but Peter can tell that he means it when his spidey sense suddenly starts singing more shrilly along his nerves, and before he knows it he’s already pointing his shooters and snatching both knife and gun away with a quick flick of his wrists before landing smoothly in the alleyway beside them. The girl immediately takes off running in one direction with a quick shout of thanks while her assailant takes off in the other.“Oh my god, SPIDEY!!” The same man who stood so serious and menacing only a second before now shrieks like one of Spider-Man’s fangirls, which ow, is decidedly less awesome than the volume his voice was at earlier and jangles hars
