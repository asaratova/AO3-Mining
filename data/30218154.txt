Chapter 1: Agent Recluse
    




Chapter Text
"Avengers. Your mission is to go undercover to stop ROMAM, also known as the Regulation Of Mutants And Normals. They have been found to kidnap and experiment on mutants and enhanced. We have given you all covers and you must work alongside another agent." Fury ordered, sitting at the head of the table in the SHIELD conference room."I'm not seducing the targets?" Natasha Romanoff questioned, eyebrows frowning. "And who is this agent we are working with?""No. You are not seducing the targets, Agent Romanoff. You are not their type so Agent Recluse will be." Fury explained."So we're meeting the elusive Agent Recluse, Alpha Level 10." Clint grinned in anticipation. 
BANG!
The door swung open and a figure in all black walked in."I'm here! Pa, I'm here and I'm not late!" The figure exclaimed, flailing his arms in the air. Fury sighed."Avengers, meet Agent Recluse. Agent Recluse, the Avengers. Recluse, unmask.""Hi. I'm a big fan of you guys. Dr Banner, I've read all your work." Recluse fanboyed. "Oh right."The black mask on Recluse's face was pealed off and revealed a very familiar face."Peter!" The Avengers cried out in shock."How do you know Peter?" Fury questioned the Avengers."He's my personal intern." Tony explained. Fury looked at Peter in frustration."And when were you going to tell me that, Pete?" Fury gritted his teeth."Don't be mad, Pa. Uncle Phil said it was cool.""I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed." "Damn son." Clint whispered as he watched the interaction
