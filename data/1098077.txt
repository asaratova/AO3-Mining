Chapter 1





Chapter Text
"A pool? Why do you want a pool?" Tony asked, confused."Uh, to swim in?" Steve replied, a little confused. "I thought for sure you'd have one.""Not actually a big fan of swimming unless it's in the actual ocean, cap. Preferably with a surfboard." Tony grinned. "I don't think I can actually have a pool this high up due to various building regulations, but I can get you a membership to a really good one a few blocks over while I look into it.""That'd be great, thanks." Steve smiled. At first the Avengers had been hesitant to take advantage of Tony's riches, but when he made it clear that he didn't care, and maybe even that he wanted to buy them things, they started relying on him for more extravagant monetary expenses.Tony nodded and forced a grin, returning to his work.A few weeks later, a pool was added to the employee workout floor; apparently putting one on the Avenger floors broke several New York zoning laws, but Steve was cool with that, and occasionally the whole team would go and just play in the water, though Tony was always too busy. It surprised Clint, a bit - Tony always wanted to hang out with the team (the archer thought the billionaire was worried that they were all going to disappear or leave when they got annoyed).
