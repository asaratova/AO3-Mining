Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Chapter 1 [Metropolis—Early October]Calendar flipped to October.  Despite Summer’s continued heat, minds looked to Labor Day and coming Fall.  Metropolis Sharks were set to open their season that weekend.   Metropolis University jumped back into session.  Campus buzzed with Student Activity.  Shoppers lined Markets’ Checkouts with Picnic’s supplies.Everyone else seemed on holiday.  One person tried to balance everything…. **** Spider-Man swung over the Metropolis skyline.  He’d familiarized himself with the city blocks and landmarks over the previous month.  Opportunity awaited Gwen and their friends at Metropolis University.  Bargains availed Shoppers along Laurel Avenue.  Honking Horns stabbed at his ears from Gridlock below.  The more things changed, the more they stayed the same it seemed….Adjustments occupied his time.  The Daily Planet challenged, pushed and prodded him.  Mike Disher proved a worthy mentor.  Travers lived up to her word from the interview.  Praise and Criticism came out in equal measures from her.  Visits with Harry and Liz eased his mind over his former roomie’s situation.  Lex and the Kents awaited their next visit.  Dichotomy separated Metropolis and Smallville.  City’s Pulse moved the former.  Country’s Alternative eased Soul’s Rhythm.  Aunt May enjoyed Senior Center and Silver Teamer activities.  And then there was the Spidey Side of Things….Ms. Travers would call a meeting on my day off!  Web Line shot from his wrist nozzle toward a cornice.  He banked a hard left turn onto Reid Lake.  Several swings brought him into view of the Planet’s facility.  Punctuality would be commended.  He….Spider Sense jarred him from Reverie’s grasp.He looked down.  There an armored truck ran a red light.  It headed for the busy intersection a quarter mile away with families and kids crossing in its intersection.  “Highjacking an armored truck?  A for effort.  F for results.”  He circled back around.  Momentum now carried him toward the fleeing vehicle.  He landed on top of the vehicle’s trailer.  Wish I knew where to set my camera up.  She wants pics of me too!  A shrug conceded that point (and the upcoming lecture).  People’s Safety outweighed Style Points….He crawled along the trailer’s roof and onto the cab.   Let’s hope money’s all that’s on here.  I don’t need fireworks or worse a bomb onboard!  He pressed on for another foot.  Spider Sense jangled in his head.  Twin Bullets perforated Roof’s metal a foot in front of himself.  Three more turned the area into a Swiss Cheese-esque design.  “Ah!  The Welcoming Committee!  You think originality would be worth more these days.”  Spidey shook his head.  Metro or the Big Apple.  They’re all the same!  He scampered down the truck’s side.Sharp Swerve jarred the vehicle to the left.  Another jerked it to the right.  Cars careened onto Sidewalk.   Bystanders just missed getting hit by it.  Sirens could be faintly heard albeit from blocks away.Spidey broke the driver’s side window.  Masked Duo reached for their guns.  “Howdy!  You know Armored Cars running lights is really bad here.  Right?  Besides it’s so cliché!”  Webbing sprayed over the passenger.  He shoved the driver over.  “Back off, Web Head!”  Driver pulled out his own pistol.  One eye remained on the road.  Two more wide shots streaked through the air.  Grunt forced another left turn.  “Why don’t you come off?  GET LOST!”“I’m stuck on you!  Why I don’t know but….”  Spidey’s webbing clogged the thief’s gun.  His fist met Driver’s Left Cheek.  Grimace twisted his mouth under the mask.  Memoria reminded him of the fireworks heist in New York a few months earlier.  “What is it with trucks and me?”  He vaulted through Broken Window and onto the seat.  “GANGWAY!!!”  His foot floored the brake.  Prayers whispered through Clenched Teeth.  “Just like in the movies right?”  His hand pressed down on the horn.  Warning blared.  Brakes squealed against speeding wheels.   Speed decreased.  Wheels came to a halt.  Horn blared two more times for Flourish’s sake.  Spidey webbed Driver and Gun together.  “They can sort it all out.”  He heard the ever-loudening sirens.  He scrambled out of the truck.  Another Web Line pulled him up into the air and toward Adjacent Intersection.Quick Changes and all that….
