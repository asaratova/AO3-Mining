Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“Where did you get that, Scott?” Stiles looked shocked at the bloody wrench in his hand. Seeing all their faces in the room judging her. Lydia, Malia, Kira, Liam, Theo, Jordan, Brett and Mason were all standing around silently judging her from their spots.“This is yours?” Scott asked while allowing Stiles to grab it from him, “Why didn’t you tell me?”“I was going to.” She replied looking at the bloody wrench, the one that killed Donovan, the one that she remembered dropping onto his head.“Why didn’t you tell me when it happened? Or any of us?” A hint of desperation coming out from Scott’s voice, which she could clearly tell that it was Scott’s telltale sign that he really wants to believe otherwise.Stiles shrugged and looked at her best friend, “I couldn’t.”“You killed him? You killed Donovan?” Scott demanded.“He was going to kill my dad. Was I supposed to let him?”“You weren’t supposed to do this. None of us are” Scott pointed out to the rest of them.Stiles looked dumbfounded at Scott’s answer, “You think I had a choice?”“There’s always a choice, Stiles.”“Yeah, well I can’t do what you can Scott.” Stiles raised her voice in frustration, “I know you wouldn’t have done it. You probably would have just figured something out right?”“I try. We were all supposed to try.”“Yeah because you’re Scott McCall! You’re the True Alpha! Guess what, all of us can’t be True Alphas. Some of us have to make mistakes. Some of us have to get our hands a little bloody sometimes. Some of us are human!” She screamed back at him while the rest looked on uncomfortably watching the 2 best friends fighting.“So you killed him?”“Scott, he was going to kill my dad.”“The way that it happened, there’s a point where, it’s just, it’s not self-defense anymore.”From feeling angry, Stiles felt confused and further frustrated by Scott’s statement, “What are you even talking about? I didn’t have a choice Scott! It was either my dad & my lives or his life!”“Stiles, we can’t kill people that we’re trying to save.” Scott stated using his Alpha tone, “We can’t & we don’t kill people, Stiles. Period.”“IT WAS EITHER MY LIFE OR HIS LIFE!!!” Stiles screamed at the top of her lungs.“You’re no longer part of the pack, Stiles.”She could not believe what she had heard. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest and she felt as if someone had stabbed her through with a knife. She felt as if everything around her stops for a few seconds while the words were repeatedly playing in her head.“What?” The word slips from between her lips quicker than her brain could process; full of a sickening amount of disbelief, because there’s no way in hell she heard what she thought that she had just heard. No way Scott, her best friends since they were 4-years-old, of all people, would even think about doing this to her after all that they had been through together.But the words had been said and now hung between them, and the rest of the pack were surprisingly dead silent, not even an objection among them. She took one step back, then another, and heard Liam whined from across the room, sensing Stiles’ entire world crumbling apart in front of the pack.Stiles straightened her shoulders back and took a deep breath. There was no way in hell she was going to give the pack the satisfaction of seeing her break down in front of all of them. She couldn’t believe that Scott couldn’t understand what she went through and was hell bent on being the moral compass of the pack regardless of the situation.Stiles glanced around the room at the people she had considered friends, if not family. They all avoided her gaze; even Scott refused to look her in the eye. Stiles shook her head ruefully; the ever present smirk sharper than usual on her face. Wearing a mask was a million times easier than showing other people your pain. And Stiles had the best poker face among all of them.“Wow, Scott, just wow.” Stiles said, her calm voice in contrast with the way her upper lip curled in disgust. “13 years of friendship just like that.”Any other day, any other time when her head wasn’t pounding, and she had a bit of space to actually stop and think for just a moment, Stiles would have argued. But that’s what they expected her to do, and Stiles was done with the pack’s expectations of her. She nodded her head once, “Fine.”She could hear the pained whimpers from the pack echoing in the room. At least she wasn’t the only one hurting down here then.“Fine?” Scott repeated, and Stiles shrugged.“Sure, whatever. No longer in the pack, got it. That means no freebies, dude. No more crawling into my room at all hours of the night because you got yourselves another murderous creature. If I’m out, I’m out. You deal with the shit yourself.” Stiles stared straight into Scott’s eyes; “None of you are welcome in my house anymore.”Theo growled softly while the rest of the pack whines.“Come near my house and I’ll trap each and everyone of you in a circle of mountain ash and you won’t even see it comin
