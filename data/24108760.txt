Chapter Text
Legends tell us one thing, history another, but every now and then there is something that belong to both. 
When the universe was created, six elemental crystals were generated with the elements of the universe 
The Blue Space Stone 
The Yellow Mind Stone 
The Red Realty Stone 
The Purple Power Stone 
The Green Time Stone 
and The Orange Soul Stone 
This six “Infinty Stones” where ment to bring balance and to be used by someone that had the power to create it
To bad that some one was not what you call Good Person 
His names is Thanos 
A Titan with the power to use the stones but with a corrupted view, thinking he spoils bring balance, when all he would do would be bringing destruction 
For Years the universe was hopeless as it waited for Thanos to complete his goal, but then something happen 
A day like no other the universe suddenly felt hope, hope that someone could stop a Thanos, a being had be born with enough power to hold the stones and with the pure heart to truly bring balance to the universe 
That was the day when Anthony Edward Stark was born.
