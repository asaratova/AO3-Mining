Chapter 1





Chapter Text

You sure do pick a lot of fights, for a little guy.
When Steve went into the ice, he had one set of words, Bucky’s words, curving across the top of his left shoulder blade.  They rested at his back, and they’d guarded him from the fear that he would be alone all his life until he’d finally met the man who’d say them: the man who would guard his back until the very end of the line.When Steve woke up, he had a thin band of scratchy black lettering wrapping around his left wrist.  He picked at the words whenever he was alone, not quite trying to scratch them off, but…  He resented this new script, this new person, who, sight unseen, had laid claim to him.He was Bucky’s.  He should’ve stayed Bucky’s. Natasha looked at her words with confusion, then fear as time went on.  When she was young, before they took her, she did not understand the writing that curved around the outside of her right breast.  With training, and time, she came to understand her words:
You gonna shoot me, Widow?
She feared her words, because if her soulmate knew enough to call her ‘Widow,’ then the answer to their question would probably be yes. Tony’s words, curving across the top of his shoulders, resting just below where a shirt would expose them to scrutiny, said:
That’s none of your business, Mr. Stark.
It explained a lot. Thor didn’t have words, being an Asgardian, what he did have was an intricately woven knot of color riding low on his right hip.  It did not emit light, but seemed to be iridescent, with colors ever-shifting.It had been black, and lifeless, once, but now glimmered with all the colors of the Bifrost.  A fitting homage to his Lady, he believed. Bruce had Oh, I’m so sorry! along the underside of his ring finger.Hulk had It’s okay, I trust you. in the same place. 
So, what’s SHIELD’s defection policy?  Do they have a dental plan?  They look like they’d have a dental plan.
Clint had never really known what to make of his words, until a grey suit and a bland expression walked into his life and turned it upside down.  There wasn’t much call for a word like ‘defection’ to be used around a circus, but secret agents?  Yeah, it started to make a lot more sense once he went government.And he made sure he knew the defection regs inside and out.
