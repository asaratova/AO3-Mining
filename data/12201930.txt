CLINTSam had insisted that they turn up a full day before Tony was expecting them, something that Steve protested at first until Natasha pointed out that they still didn’t have written confirmation from Ross that all charges levelled against them had been dropped.Part of Clint felt awkward about turning up unexpectedly; Tony would see it as a lack of trust. The assassin side of Clint thought that the precautionary measure was totally justified.They approached the unmanned front entrance and paused.“Umm…F.R.I.D.A.Y?” Steve tentatively asks the air.“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” comes F.R.I.D.A.Y’s smooth voice.“May we enter?”“Certainly,” the A.I. replies, “though I should inform you that, since you were not expected until tomorrow, Mr Stark is not here to greet you.”The doors slide open and the foyer lights up as they enter.“Is Vision here?” asks Wanda.“No,” F.R.I.D.A.Y replies. “He is attending a meeting on the west coast. Ms Potts and Colonel Rhodes are also unavailable. The only person currently in the building is Peter. I will inform him of your arrival.”Clint looks around at the others. “Who’s Peter?” he asks them.The rest of the team shrugs but F.R.I.D.A.Y responds. “He is Mr Stark’s intern. He is currently in the kitchen but he has just informed me he will come down to welcome you.”“Did anyone know Tony has an intern?”More shrugs. They only have to wait a couple more seconds before they hear light footsteps running in their direction.A teenager, dressed in jeans, a hoodie and a t-shirt (reading: ‘May the mass times acceleration be with you’ in the scrolling text of a Star Wars opening scene) skids into the foyer. Clint notes that the kid is short, with dark hair and dark eyes that snap rapidly from one Avenger to the next as he approaches. Clint has spent years honing his instincts, and despite the kid’s casual air as he approaches them, something tells Clint that the teen’s movements are controlled and purposeful.Clint almost ignores his instincts when the kid opens his mouth.“Uh…hi! Hi guys! I mean, Avengers, I mean…” the kid ruefully rubs the back of his neck. “Um…I’m Peter, Tony’s intern. He, um, he told me you were arriving tomorrow. Not that you’re not welcome today, of course!”The ramble cuts off and the team exchanges looks varying from amused to bemused.Steve takes the initiative. “We hoped we could turn up early. Get settled in ASAP.”“Cool, cool!” exclaims the teen, grinning now. “That’s very cool. Um, would you like me to show you to the rooms Tony has set up for you? You could dump your bags and then I could either give you a tour or you could just explore the place yourselves, or whatever?”Steve explains to Peter that everyone but Scott has been here before, but they accept his offer to show them to their rooms, which is how they all end up traipsing after the kid, who points out rooms to Scott along the way.“…and that down there is the gym room. The weights on the bench press go up to 10 tonne…”Clint wonders what Tony was thinking, allowing a teenager to stay somewhere as risk-attracting as Avengers HQ. It just doesn’t make sense.Something else that doesn’t make sense is Peter’s attitude towards them. Sure, he appears excited and welcoming, nothing unusual about that. The thing is, kids his age usually do this whole ‘gobsmacked-with-awe, hero-worship’ thing when meeting even one of the Avengers, never mind a half dozen of them. Hell, adults do it too.It’s not like Clint wants the teen to be drooling over them all. The down-to-earth attitude is a really nice change when meeting a civilian. It’s remarkably mature and a little bit odd.He shows them all their rooms, asks if they’ve eaten yet and offers to make a stir fry when Natasha says they’ve haven’t, claiming that he was making one for himself anyway.Nat stands at Clint’s door as he pulls clothes out of a bag and places them in the closet.“Any thoughts on the kid?” She asks.“I was hoping you knew,” he replies, to which she shrugs."I've got a theory, but I'm not certain.""Wanna share?""Not yet," she replies, tapping her nose before heading back to her own room.A short while later, Peter is doling stir fry out into bowls and the team converges at a large dining table. Clint watches as the kid helps himself to a bowlful of stir fry and then starts to head in the direction of the bedrooms.It is Scott who stops him. “Hey, Peter, aren’t you going to eat with us?”The teen looks surprised and a little bit self-conscious. “I don’t want to intrude.”“Not at all,” says Wanda.So Peter sits down next to Scott and applies himself quietly to his meal.Sam begins the interrogation. “So, Peter, how long have you been interning for Tony?”“Err….about, eight months?”“Enjoying it?”“Sure, absolutely. The tech is amazing.”Natasha takes a turn. “What do you do as an intern?”Peter reaches for his glass of water and takes a long swallow before answering. “Whatever needs doing, I guess. Tony occasionally lets me tinker with stuff in the lab.”A few eyebro
