The proposal is the sweetest, most offhand thing. A simple, “You know same sex marriage it legal in New York, right?” from Steve in the dead of night and a quick, tired, “Yeah, I’ve heard the news,” from Tony.  Steve stares at him, fidgeting a little, like they haven’t been together for almost three years and they’ve practically been married since Steve snatched him out of Stane’s clutches by sheer stubbornness alone just as long ago.They had lain there, in bed, with Tony’s arc reactor glowing between them in the middle of the night after a long fight with Dr. Doom and a lot of press conferences orchestrated by Pepper, because the woman is crazy and feels the need to get some semblance of control over things before New York spins into frenzy. Tony is tired, but he keeps his eyes open long enough to ask, “So, are we like…doing a summer wedding or something, ‘cause I have to tell you: I’m so not a fan of winter.”He sees Steve smile as his last coherent thought before drifting off.In the morning, Tony has a ring on his finger, simple titanium from the feel of it, and he grins at it a little before going off in search of his new fiancé.And that’s the proposal.IMCAThey both agree to hire a wedding planner, which turns out to be the funniest thing ever in Tony’s opinion. Try having a random planner over to Avenger’s mansion and showing champagne flutes to half of SHIELD. Really. It’ll be worth your time.Everyone is present for the first meeting with this woman, who he thinks is names Melody, but he’s not sure, from the Avengers to half of their significant others, to Darcy, Rhodey, Happy, Target and strangely, Director Fury. It’s a miracle they didn’t send this woman away in tears, because all of them have input and they are very vocal, violent, and voracious. It’s been agreed that no ‘hero-colors’ will be present at the wedding which leaves startlingly few choices. Orange and yellow are so out of the picture.Steve at one point asks why it can’t be just black and white, like normal, and actually the one who takes offence to that notion is Fury, who says in no uncertain terms, “I am not going to sit through a fucking daze of zebra print because you were stupid enough to ask Stark to be the future motherfucking Mrs. Rogers! I don’t care if you have to dress in pink! There is going to be some god damn color somewhere!”Bruce randomly decides on turquoise for all of them, because it’s technically not anyone’s color and it matches Steve’s eyes. Tony has to say, “Thank you,” to him after the tuxedo fitting.The rest of the planning kind of goes downhill from that point and Tony eventually decides to let his friends deal with it, because apparently they will get nowhere fast otherwise.  Thor throws himself into it, kidnapping Pepper and Bruce, who oddly has such a taste for color-schemes it’s mind-boggling, and they just take care of the rest.The only thing Tony and Steve have to deal with for the rest of the time is invitations and deciding on the cake, which even those get taken over by Natasha and Clint. Natasha gets the invitations in order like a freaking ninja rolodex and Clint goes cake ‘shopping.’ Tony knows he just wants to eat all the cake samples.Fury gets them their marriage licenses and shoves it under their bedroom door like it’s some top secret mission. It’s even in a plain brown envelope marked for ‘The Rogers’,’ and Tony starts making cracks about being Mr. and Mrs. Smith with way better storyline. Steve laughs at him, but still runs his fingers along the paper reverently with a bit irritation caught in his eyes.Coulson is officiating and promises that any misbehavior on Tony’s part will have him paralyzed at his own wedding. He’s a bit edgier ever since Supernanny was taken off the air. He’s gone from tazing to more serious threats and Tony is almost ready to fund eternal seasons until Coulson is in a grave.IMCAIt’s about a month until the wedding day, thankfully in summer, and Steve is lounging on Tony’s couch in his shop. Tony’s working on upgrades for the Quinjet, War Machine, and Iron Man all at the same time and he’s pretty sure Steve is drawing or perhaps tinkering away at the classic Harley they’d bought about two years ago, but he can’t be sure as he mutters sweet nothings to JARVIS as encouragement to do exactly as he’s asked.Target is under one of the tables, but he’s learned long since he was a puppy not to make too much of a ruckus and go to sleep.It’s been like this for almost two hours when Tony’s concentration is sweetly broken by Steve clearing his throat. He tells JARVIS, “Hold that thought, will ya?” to which, there is the automatic sarcastic response, “I hold all your thoughts, sir.”He turns around and Steve is looking at him with that bashful, troubled sort of expression he can pull off perfectly. He has his lower lip trapped between his teeth hypnotically as he stares at the pad of paper on his lap. There’s a long moment between when he clears his throat and when he speaks,
