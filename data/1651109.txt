Monday AM
(10:30) How much do you reckon McGonagall will kill me for flooding her office?(10:32) Who is McGonagall? And personally, I don’t receive well with having my own things flooded.(10:33) What do you mean who’s McGonagall? How hard did Lily hit you this time? She’s only the love of my life.(10:34) Oh shit. New phone. Wrong number. Sorry.(10:35) I figured. It’s ok. But if she’s the love of your life, why are you flooding her office?(10:40) She’s not really the love of my life. She’s my professor and head of house. I’d like to think we have some unrequited love though.(10:41) I get the vague impression she deals with a lot of shit with you.(10:41) …yeah, but she secretly loves it.(10:41) In that case, I’ll leave you two to it. 
Monday PM
(3:45) I got 3 months detention and 24 death threats.(3:46) Wrong number again.(3:46) No no, I’m updating you. I flooded an entire floor of dormitories. It was brilliant.(3:47) Not to be mean, Random Stranger Who Texted the Wrong Number, but don’t you have friends you can tell this to?(3:47) Also, floor of dormitories? Where the hell are you?(3:38) All my friends were there, Random Stranger Who Keeps Replying.(3:38) I’m at boarding school. Don’t get the wrong impression though, I’m totally punk rock.(3:40) Anyone who has to say they are punk rock are entirely not punk rock at all.(3:40) Whatever. I’m punk rock. I don’t need to prove myself to you.(3:41) Well don’t get all sulky now. Why did you flood your professor’s office?(3:41) It wasn’t her office I was aiming for, but unfortunately it’s on the same floor as certain persons dorm rooms.(3:41) They were the target. Simply bc they’re dicks.(3:45) You sound a bit like a dick.(3:47) We’ve gone through this. I’m punk rock.(3:53) I have to go to my first detention now. Good bye stranger.*
Wednesday MIDDAY
(12:07) Do they have decent food at boarding school?(12:10) Hello to you too. Thanks for consoling me on my detention journey.(12:10) Drama queen. Come on. Food. Good?(12:13) Not really. Unless you like to eat cardboard and meat mashups.(12:14) Meat mashup sounds interesting.(12:15) Not until there’s no longer meat in the meat mashup and it’s just pulverized peas and gravy and breadcrumbs.(12:16) Is that what you’re having now?(12:16) Right now I have a juice box bc I don’t trust what’s in the soup. Last time there was a sock.(12:16) And I wasn’t even the one who put it there.(12:17) Are juice boxes punk rock?(12:17) Duck off Ads hole.(12:17) WOW.(12:18) ARGH. IT’S A NEW PHONE. **FUCK OFF ARSEHOLE.(12:18) Amazing. The eloquence.(12:18) I guess your lunch is better than mine, is it?(12:19) I thought it wouldn’t be, but you’ve proven me wrong. I have pumpkin soup and jelly. It was either this or sandwiches made of sponges.(12:20) Jelly? Are you 5?(12:21) Bugger off. Don’t be jelly of my jelly.(12:21) You didn’t(12:22) I did and will now see myself out. Have fun with detention tonight. 
Wednesday PM
(1:01) You were texting at lunch but me and Pete were right there.(1:01) You don’t have other friends.(1:02) How dare you, I have a whole plethora of acquaintances that I can call upon when your ugly arse does not deliver.(1:03) Liar.(1:10) Oh come on, you’re not ignoring me now.(1:11) Did I need to respond to something?(1:11) Don’t play idiot. You do that naturally enough.(1:12) The wrong number I texted the other day. They asked if boarding school food was any good.(1:13) They know you go to boarding school? Did you also give them your blood type and home address?(1:13) Dude.(1:14) What about your DNA sequence? Make it easier for them to just clone you.(1:14) What are you even on about.(1:15) It’s just weird that this random knows you go to a boarding school.(1:15) You’re just overreacting, man. They don’t know which boarding school I go to. They don’t even know my name. I don’t their name. Shit, idek their gender.(1:16) Whatever, Pads. Just don’t get murdered, yeah?(1:17) I don’t want to have to bury your body. You’re too fuckin heavy, man.(1:17) Thank you for caring.*(1:15) Hey, what’s your name?(1:18) Not happening.(1:18) Is that what your mother calls you?(1:19) No, but at the same time she does call me Pumpkin and Sweetheart, does not mean that’s my name either.(1:20) You’ve opened a door here, Sweetheart, that you probably shouldn’t have.(1:20) Shit.(1:21) What about gender then? Boy, girl, in between, both, none, come on.(1:22) Are you putting me on Craigslist?(1:23) Ok fine, I’m a boy.(1:30) Is this a disappointing establishment?(1:40) Whatever.*

It’s history. Boring.(9:42) What are you learning?(9:43) French Revolution. So much forehead.(9:46) J'aime la Révolution française! remet-toi au travail, connard.(9:46) Oh my god I should have known you were one of those people. I d
