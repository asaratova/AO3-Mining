Every evening at the same time, as the pale golden light of the Asgard sunset faded into darkness over the city, Odin would saddle his horse, ride out to the end of the broken bifrost, and ask the gatekeeper the same question.“Can you see him?” Odin asked, knowing he had received the same answer for too many nights to count.“I have not seen Loki since he came of age,” Heimdall said, “and yet tonight, I can.”“You can? Do you know why?” Odin asked, excited that his son was indeed still alive. “Is he injured? Does he need help?”“He seems preoccupied… with other matters.”“Other matters?”Heimdall watched for a moment, wondering how he could possibly describe to Odin the strange sights that he had seen this day. How was he to tell the king that his youngest son was currently having sex with a giant Squirrel named Ratatoskr in the branches of Yggdrasil? Should he describe the way the young prince threw his head back as the creature traced the delicate lines of his chest with the tip of its bushy tail? Should he describe how Loki moaned wantonly as the Squirrel entered him?Should he tell the All Father that earlier in the day he had watched as Loki had mated with Ari, the giant Eagle of Nifleheim? How the bird had held him gently in its wings, and brushed the hair out of his eyes with its massive primary feathers, as it rubbed itself against him.Would it please Odin to hear that his son was currently hopping between the beds of half of the nine realms, and most seemed powerless to resist his charms?“You would not wish to know,” Heimdall replied.“Tell me, man! Is he injured?”Heimdall sighed, and said, “The virgin queen is a virgin no more.”“Virgin queen?”“Oh,” Heimdall said, raising an eyebrow, the only show of emotion he had given in centuries. “I thought you knew.”“Knew?” Odin asked. “Knew what?”“That Loki was the future Queen of Jotunheim,” Heimdall said. “I thought that was why you took him. So the Jotuns would not be able to replenish their armies.”“Queen? You jest, Loki is a prince.”“The Jotun have only one sex, my king, and only one among them is capable of spawning future generations,” Heimdall explained, then he raised his eyebrow again and said, “Really? You did not know this?”“What the Jotuns do in their beds is no business of mine,” Odin replied, as his cheeks began to turn red. “What will happen to him?”“When he has collected the seed of enough, he will begin to lay, and he will not stop,” Heimdall replied. “The task of the Jotun queen is to populate the entire realm, but he will populate whatever realm he is in.”“Loki must be brought home at once. I shall use the long forbidden dark energies to send Thor to find him,” Odin said. He began to walk away, then paused, and turned back to Heimdall, and said, “but we should keep this queen thing between ourselves.”

The battle against Loki and the Chitauri had been hard, but was a victory nevertheless, even though it had been at the cost of many lives, and as Thor stood in central park, surrounded by the Avengers, he was torn between feeling anger at his brother’s crimes, and happiness that he was finally taking him home after a year of believing him dead.Thor handed the end of the Tesseract device to his brother, and watched as he took hold of the handle, his wrists bound by the shackles that prevented him from using his magic, and his mouth muzzled to prevent his lies.Shimmering blue light surrounded them; it pulled them upwards, almost like the bifrost, but it lacked control, it was raw and disorientating. When they landed on the bridge Thor was overcome by weakness, and he felt himself sinking to his knees in front of his brother, who seemed to have coped much better with the trip than he had.Thor didn’t realise he had let go of the end of the device that contained the Tesseract until he looked up and saw Loki was now holding both ends of it, one in each hand. He watched as the chains and muzzle that held his brother began to crack, turning to dust and falling from Loki’s skin like sand moving through an hourglass, to reveal his crazed grin.“How?” Thor asked, with a look of horror upon his face.“You think Asgardian magic could control me?” Loki asked.“Then why did you not try to escape on Midgard, brother?”“I needed to wait for my magic to recover to escape through the secret paths, but thanks to you I don’t need to wait any longer,” Loki said, and then he vanished in a beam of blue light, taking the Tesseract device with him, and leaving Thor alone on the bifrost.Thor waited until his dizziness cleared, and then he spun Mjolnir and flew down the bifrost. He landed and entered the palace, but found the throne room deserted, so headed to his parent’s private quarters.“Father, Loki has escaped, you must send me after him once more,” Thor shouted as he barged through the door.His mother kept vigil by the bed where Odin lay, surrounded by a golden glow, and she smiled at him gently.“It was too much for him,” Frigga said, as she gently took Thor’s
