“Tony?”Steve sounded tentative as he hovered near the entrance of Tony’s workshop, the glass walls having already been replaced but remaining clear now that there were no secrets to hide. The genius himself puzzled at his hesitance.“The door’s unlocked.”“Right.” Again, Steve sounded a bit off. Where was the anger that had shrouded him like a cloak for weeks now? “I, um-Can I come in? I need to talk to you.”A hint of fear crawled its icy way down Tony’s spine. Yes, he absolutely deserved whatever it was Steve had planned for him, but that didn’t make it enjoyable. Loki and James were already spending most nights curled around him, murmuring assurances that he wasn’t a monster. It wasn’t true, of course, but it was nice that they thought it was. They shouldn’t be angry with Cap for what he’d done but Tony, the selfish bastard that he was, couldn’t help the warmth in his chest whenever they rose to his defense. God, he was disgusting.James refused to talk to Steve at all, after they’d gotten into a fight in the kitchen that resulted in the death of the refrigerator. James had taken exception to something Steve had said to Tony and punched the other super soldier in the face. The fight had only broken up when Tony jumped in between them and got three cracked ribs for his trouble. Loki had healed them, of course, but it was good no one else had been around so they could pretend the injury never happened. Cap certainly hadn’t noticed how much pain he was in before James managed to whisk him away.Loki had been more active lately in his role of supervillain, too. Even when he wasn’t the one to draw the Avengers out into a fight, he would show up anyway just to beat them into the ground. Steve always took the worst of it and it didn’t help that the Hulk was currently benched from all action. Bruce hadn’t been pleased to learn of what the other three had done, either. Tony had tried to get Loki to stop, or to at least lay off a bit, but there was no controlling the God of Chaos. Loki said he would cease his actions when Steve ceased blaming Tony for things that weren’t his fault. The only problem was they were Tony’s fault. Steve had every right to blame him.Tony got it, he really did. He’d lied to Steve about James when he knew how desperate Steve was for even some small contact with his best friend. Then, by refusing to tell his teammates what was going on, he’d forced their hands so that now James saw them as enemies. Tony had stolen Steve’s best friend from him, ruined their relationship. Steve should be angry with Tony, and Tony would take any and all punishment that came along with that.“Yeah, sure.” He refused to show the fear inside of him. “Come on in. What do you need to talk about?”“Thor’s back.” Steve followed Tony over to the couch and sat down with him, hands folded in his lap, fingers twitching. “He arrived this morning.”“Well, we did think this upswing of activity from Loki might bring him back. Important business in Asgard or not, he’ll always take time out for his brother.”Tony wasn’t sure where this was going, and it made him nervous. He’d rather know what was coming his way beforehand, thank you very much. Then at least he could brace for it. Steve gave a little huff of laughter, which set Tony on edge all the more. Steve hadn’t laughed around him since before the entire Protocol: Snowflake incident.“I always manage to forget how observant he is,” Steve said. “He knew almost immediately that something was bothering me. He wanted to know what it was.” A hand came up to scratch sheepishly at the back of Steve’s head. “I have to confess, I thought he’d take my side and I haven’t been feeling like many people have done that lately. So I told him about what happened.”Tony stiffened. Steve had told Thor. Fuck. The guy wasn’t exactly known for keeping his mouth shut and if he was angry with Tony, too, then there would sure to be another fight involving James. Thor could fry the arm in a heartbeat. It was hooked straight into Bucky’s nervous system. At best, he’d be severely injured. At worst, he’d die. And it would be all Tony’s fault. He panicked, launching himself forward to grab hold of Steve’s arm.“Please, Steve, I know you’re mad and you’re right and I’m sorry, but please don’t let this happen. I’ll do whatever you want me to but you have to stop Thor. God, please, Steve, I’m begging you! James can’t take that kind of damage. If you care about him at all, you have to help me stop this!”Steve looked alarmed.“What? Stop Thor from what? What damage? Tony, what are you talking about?”Tony didn’t have time to explain. James was upstairs in the penthouse. If Thor went there looking for Tony they’d run into each other for sure. Tony was on his feet in a millisecond, heading for the door. Steve’s hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back, though, spinning him around so he had to face the soldier. Tony’s breaths were coming short, the panic taking over. He fought back, even though he knew it wo
