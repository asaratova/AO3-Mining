Chapter 1





Chapter Text
It was about a month into Peter Parker’s senior year of high school when he got the news.       “Alright, now. Somehow you bunch of rowdy kids have made it onto the Stark Industries radar, and now we’ve been invited a tour of the place. I have the permission slips, and I. Want. Them. By. Thursday. If you don’t get them in by Thursday. You’re not going… Any questions?” Mr. Harrington announced with a pained expression.     “Will Tony Stark be leading the tour?” Asked a classmate.     “I don’t know, but my guess is probably not.”      This response made a few people sigh, and a few give out a, “SHUCKS,” but only one person muttered a, “Thank Thor!” This person was Peter Parker, and yes, he received a few confused and dirty looks.                                                                                           -------------------------------------Once Friday rolled around, Peter had become more and more stressed at the thought of his classmates grilling him about his internship. Flash, who obviously gained too much joy from taunting Peter, had made it his personal mission to get the truth out about the internship. Flash had managed to catch up to Peter before they all loaded onto the bus and decided this was the perfect time to bring it up.     “Wow Peter, I can’t wait to hear from Stark himself all about the great things you contribute to the company!”    “He’s probably not gonna be there Flash. Mr. Harrington already went over that,” Peter grumbled.
This obviously annoyed Flash, Peter could tell it made him anxious due to the fact that he heard his heart rate increase.    “Whatever Penis. I know you’re just scared of getting exposed. But soon enough, all will be revealed,” Flash said in a sharp tone, before pushing ahead of Peter to go sit next to his friends.     “Don’t worry Peter, the only one who will be exposed today is flash, when F.R.I.D.A.Y. recognizes you and announces you as an intern. Then everyone will finally find out the liar he is,” Said Ned, his best friend, in a comforting voice. “Come on, let’s try and get a seat together.”                                                                                           -------------------------------------   The bus ride was shorted than Peter anticipated. He expected that they would have to drive slower, or go a different route then what Happy uses, but in the end it was almost the same. Mr. Harrington stood up and ushered everyone off the bus and into the the lobby of Stark Tower. Peter had been here many times before, but he guessed that because it was always a rush to swing into the building, he never got to really look around.     “Hello Midtown School of Science and Technology, I’m Kate, your tour guide today. I have badges for you all for safety and security reasons. So if everyone could find their badge that would be great.”    Peter wasn’t sure if he even had a badge before today, but once he, along with everyone else swiped his badge he heard the distinct voice of F.R.I.D.A.Y.     “Welcome back Peter. Boss wanted to go over the project you were working on yesterday. He will be available after school today.”   Everyone including Kate the tour guide looked shocked, and all turned to look at Peter. He didn’t want anymore attention, so he tried to defuse the overwhelming curiosity by shrugging his shoulders.   “Okay, thanks,” was all Peter could get out before having to turn away from embarrassment.    “Alright, now that everyone has their passes, we should get moving. Maybe if we’re lucky, we might get to see what Tony is working on with a team of the best scientists in the world. But, the only way we will be able to see it, is if we all move through the other parts of the tour with no horsing around. Understood?” Kate said loud and clear, and nodded after she heard a few, “Yes’.”                                                                                              --------------------------------  The elevator gave a loud, “Ding!” and opened to a large enough space to fit the whole group of 17 students, Mr. Harrington, and the tour guide Kate. After Kate punched in a few numbers on a screen, swiped her pass, and pressed the floor button, they were off in the speedy elevator. They all filed out at floor 28, and patiently waited for Kate to explain what was on this floor.     “This is the floor of all the older models of suits Tony Stark, or others have designed or made. As you can see there to the right, there is a recreation of the original Iron Man suit, and one of my personal favorites, is in the right back corner of the room. The original Spider-Man man suit designed and stitched by Spider-Man himself,” explained Kate.This news made a few people have little oooh and ahhh moments and were excited when Kate said they had 30 minutes to look around, until they had to move on. Peter could not help but smile once he saw that almost the entire group had immediately flocked over to the Spider-Man exhib
