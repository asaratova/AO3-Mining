Work Text:
“I can’t see…”Jean’s words are weak, her body shaking even as she feels Alice’s arms slide around her. The soft hiss of ice and fire melts her a little and then there’s light, sparkling lights brightening the darkness and sparkling icicles fill the air, dripping in soft sparkles.“Now?”“Now I can…”Jean murmurs, relaxing into Alice, sighing at the feeling of Alice’s lips at her hairline, glad that she came home to Alice, even when the Pheonix longs to burst free. Lights sparkle a little more and Jean sighs as her eyes slip closed, her rest simpler, more easy, with Alice holding her.
