Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
Charles scans his seminar group, doing a quick headcount.  Fifteen.  He glances towards the clock and sighs.  It’s already five after.  He thinks it isn’t too much to ask for all the students to at least show up for the first day.  Still, it isn’t fair to keep the rest of the class waiting for just one student.
Gathering his notes, he calls the group to attention, fifteen sets of eyes immediately focusing in on him.  It’s his third semester as a TA, and he still finds himself flustered under the collective gaze of his students.  
The first day is always largely administrative: handing out the syllabus, going over attendance and coursework policies, letting them know the date of the exam so far in advance that it was impossible for them to claim a conflict at the end of term.
Still, he has hopes of delving into at least some of the course material, letting the students know what they’d be in for.
After thirty minutes of the same ridiculous questions about missed classes and coursework that he fields every term, Charles checks the time and grins.  He still has twenty minutes.
Just as he reaches for his lecture notes, the door slams open, revealing a tall, hard-eyed boy.  He doesn’t even have the decency to look ashamed as all the eyes in the room turn towards him.
“Sorry,” the boy mumbles half-heartedly.  “I had—“
“Take a seat,” Charles firmly cuts him off.  They always have excuses. If he accepted every one, no one would ever come to class on time.  “You must be Erik Lehnsherr,” he glances down at his attendance sheet.  “You’re over half an hour late, Mr. Lehnsherr.  You’ve missed quite a lot of important material.”
The boy just nods, ducking his head and striding to an open desk at the back of the room, not meeting the eyes of his peers.  If it wasn’t against university policy to read the thoughts of his students, Charles knows the murmur at the back of his mind would be all about the new student.  Some of the students look annoyed, others simply amused, enjoying the schadenfreude.  There is very little sympathy evident.
“Can someone please pass Mr. Lehnsherr a syllabus?” Charles asks, knowing there are extras floating somewhere within the group.  
The boy grabs for the paper handed to him and bows his head over it.  The hard, lean lines of his slender body are all the more evident in his tense posture.  “We’ve already gone over all the course policies, but most of the information is reflected on the first page of your syllabus.  Do you have any questions?”
“Yeah,” the boy’s voice is deep and slightly accented.  “When is the exam?”
Charles sighs, not even bothering to hide his annoyance.  “I covered that at the beginning of class.”
“I just want to make sure—”
“It’s December 21st,” Charles interrupts, eyes flicking to the clock.  He still has ten minutes.  He might be able to squeeze in at least the intro to next week’s lecture topic.   “Now, if you can all open your books…”
Lehnsherr’s raised hand looms in the air.  
“Yes?” 
“I want just wondering how much attendance affects our grade?”
“Planning on missing more classes already?” Charles asks archly.  One of the girls in the front row giggles.  
“No, I just—“
“I think it’s unfair to make your classmates sit through this material a second time, especially since they all managed to show up on time.  If you have any more questions, you can ask one of your peers, or come to my office hours.”
Lehnsherr glares, closing his mouth into a hard line.
Charles refuses to be cowed.  He won’t let one insolent student ruin his first class.  “Opening your books,” he repeats, “to the introduction.  You’ll see that we will be studying the basic components of biology.”
As the students filter out of the room ten minutes later, Lehnsherr doesn’t even spare Charles a glance.  He doesn’t look particularly inclined to ask any of his classmates to fill him in on the material he had missed, and given the hard set of his jaw as he strides past Charles’ desk, Charles is pretty sure he won’t be seeing him at his office hours, either.
Oh, well, Charles thinks, packing up his bag.  Every class has one trouble student.  
 
_______________________________________________________________________________
 
The next week Charles looks out over the sea of fifteen faces with a kind of grim satisfaction.  No Lehnsherr.  
As predicted, he hadn’t heard from the boy during the previous week, not even a quick email to confirm course policies. 
Disappointment had welled up in him as he noted the small “M” next to Lehnsherr’s name on his student ledger.  Mutants had fought so hard to be treated like everyone else, to get a chance to attend University and get a job and not face the kind of discrimination that had haunted their kind for decades.  And Lehnsherr was throwing it all away. 
Charles starts class at the hour, on the dot.  No point in waiting for a student that doesn’t seem to care whether he even knows where to hand in his coursework.
