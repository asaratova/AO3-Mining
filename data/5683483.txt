Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Author's Note:  Some of the most common questions I've been asked are:  Are you ever going to introduce Tommy/Speed?  But what about the Scarlet Witch?  How can Billy appear first?  What about Age of Ultron?  I figured if tackling the Clone Saga didn't kill me or send me into a catatonic state, I could try my hand at answering those questions -- all in one story.  It's taken me this long to figure out how to do it.  Hope you like the results.     Chapter 1   Training Room - Avengers Tower    Barnes isn't even remotely tired and he's been sparring with the After School Avengers for nearly two hours.  Kate likes to go first and she likes to try taking Barnes down solo these days.  He's all for it.  She comes into each session with new strategies and clearly having practiced the techniques he's shown her.  More importantly, Barnes is certain that Kate studies the videos of these workouts because she never goes down the same way twice.  And he's not holding back as much with her anymore.  She's up in the bleachers with the Spider-Twins, sporting some new bruises and cheering Teddy on as he comes at Barnes like a battering ram.  Teddy is stronger and he's got unbreakable skin.  He relies on those two facts far too much.  Barnes lets the boy corner him, assessing how Teddy presses his advantage.  Teddy has a long way to go before he'll be able to take on Barnes.  Or even the Spider-Twins.  Barnes easily vaults over Teddy, gives the kid a swift kick that sends him sprawling and then pins him.  "Ten reps of your Katas, kid.  You're not using what I'm teaching you and you should," Barnes says, letting Teddy up. "Petey, spot him and then go a round with him."  Billy is over in the corner, finishing his warm up.  As always, he's the last to spar with Barnes and Barnes has a feeling the boy is harboring some vain hope that he won't have to spar at all.  It's more than obvious that Billy doesn't like to fight with his fists and he especially doesn't like being hit.  Or being knocked down.  Or thrown around.  "C'mon, Wiccan, you're up," Barnes summons him.  He's been going easiest on Billy, taking him through the basics of self-defense.   "Ready to break some holds today?"  "Sure," Billy says unenthusiastically.  He seems tired today, drawn and even a little pale.  Barnes narrows his eyes. "You feeling okay?"  Billy shrugs.     "You want a pass today?" Barnes asks.    "Let's just get this over with," Billy sighs.  Shaking his head, Barnes comes up behind Billy and puts him in a hold. It's one they've been practicing for the last couple of weeks and this time, Barnes barely uses any strength.  The kid shouldn't have any problems breaking this one.  "Go Billy!" Kate calls.  "Kick the Winter Soldier's butt!"  Jessica cheers loudly.    Billy bends forward and brings up his elbows but he forgets to hook his ankle around Barnes'.  He struggles, unable to break Barnes' grip.  "What did you forget?"  There's a pause and then Billy groans when he figures out his mistake.  "Sorry."  Barnes decides to throw him a bone. "I'm going to come at you and I want you to flip me, just like we practiced.  You ready?"  "Uh, okay."  The boy isn't ready and it takes effort for Barnes to slow down and telegraph his moves.  He also makes a lot of noise.  His handlers would be horrified if they saw him doing this, even in a training exercise.  Barnes charges.  Billy raises his hands.  Everything goes white.  The next thing Barnes knows, he's flat on his back and Teddy is hovering over him, hands pressed over Barnes' heart and wearing a look of sheer terror.  "Oh, thank God," Petey exclaims, peering over Teddy's shoulder.  "He's breathing."  Did he stop breathing?  Did his heart stop?  Apparently it did.  Petey nudges Teddy out of the way and leans over Barnes.  "You've got some pretty bad electrical burns and your heart stopped for, like, less than a minute.  Don't try to --  Bucky!"  Barnes sits up.  He's had worse, way worse.  "Where's Billy?"  "In the locker room," Teddy tells him.  "He's pretty upset."    "I bet."  Barnes gets to his feet.  The burns hurt and he's grateful for his HYDRA conditioning that makes it possible to ignore the pain.  What he can't ignore are the scorched floorboards and the blown out lights.  "You kids do your reps while I talk to Billy and when I come back, you're all done for the day."  Teddy blocks Barnes' path.  "He's sorry --"  "Teddy, it was an accident.  He lost control."  Barnes pats the kid's shoulder.  "I'm not going to be even a little bit mean to him.  I promise."  That earns him a smile.  "Thanks, Bucky."  Billy hastily scrubs at his face when Barnes enters the locker room but he can't hide his red-rimmed, puffy eyes.  "I'm sorry.  I'm really, really --"  "I know you are," Barnes tells him.    "It won't --"  "It will happen again."  "It won't," Billy protests.  "I-I'll do better.  Try harder."  Barnes sighs.  "I can teach you to fight.  I can teach you to use weapons.  I can eve
