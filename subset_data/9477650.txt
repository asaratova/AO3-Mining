Chapter 1: Along Came A Spider
    




Chapter Text

 If you ever left me 

 I'd tear my heart out 

 and never put it back. 
  
{Yellow box}

[White box]
Wade leaned forward looking out the small cabin window at the bright winking lights of New York City. From inside his private jet, they almost looked like diamonds but he knew better, they were really glittering sharks teeth waiting to rip you apart the first chance they got. Sighing he leaned back into his seat, it had been a long job that had become longer when his client deiced not to pony up and pay him and he'd had to track the little cretin down and extract the payment the old fashion way. In Wades earlier mercenary days this occurrence happened quite often, but since then he's built up a rep, people knew that when they hired Deadpool to do their dirty deeds he'd do them, he'd also be there bright an early to collect and if you didn't cough up the cash there would be dire consequences.Death to be blunt. 
{At least he's still alive he should be thankful}
 
[Ten digits light but yeah guess you gotta count your blessing]
 
{Kind of hard when you don't have fingers}
 
[He can use his toes..]
 “Dammit I should've cut off his toes too..or at least a couple of em” Wade muttered absentmindedly, sliding down further in the plush seat he yawned, exhausted. He was so tired he didn't even want to eat. The boxes had kept him up the entire flight having a screaming match over which Saw movie sucked more. Wade would've just shot himself so he could get a couple of hours of shut eye but he was on a plane and such action is frowned upon when you're 40,000 feet up in the air. 
[Pretty sure its frowned upon everywhere dipshit]
 “I could always stab myself,” Wade considered taking out his favorite hunting knife and flipping it expertly. The boxes shut up for exactly five minutes before they went back to arguing about the mating habits of Gentoo penguins. ___________________________________ Upon landing the red and black clad mercenary skipped hurriedly down the unfolding steps, breathing deeply. It was a warmish August night and as tired as he'd felt the night was young which meant Spidey would be out. He should definitely look up his favorite bug before he headed home. Maybe he could even convince the boy to take a break and get something to eat with him. “Welcome home Sir” his driver Edward said opening the door to his waiting car. Edward had been Wades butler slash driver slash best friend slash lover just kidding there was nothing 'that' weird going on between them, for a little over a decade. He also kept Wade from spending his money (more) recklessly, along with taking care of his houses and all his accounts. In short, the man was like his own personal Alfred Pennyworth, expect more bad ass, and he was Sottish not British. “Thanks, Ed, is my bike fueled up,” Wade asked throwing his bags to the tall silver haired man. “Waiting in hanger three,” Edward said catching his bags heavy with ammunition and various weapons effortlessly, he didn't blink when blood and sticky goo began leaking out of one the duffel bags. “Shall I refrigerate this one?” The man asked, holding the bag that reeked of three-day old severed extremities. “Yeah put it with the others” Wade replied chuckling darkly over his shoulder as he jogged towards the third hanger. “Sir, would you like me to drive you there” his driver called popping open the trunk. “Nah it's a nice night for a run,” Wade said grinning. He wondered if the little hero had missed him. The two had been hanging out more lately, he'd even been allowed to go on the occasional patrol. Albeit he wasn't allowed to kill anyone or maim anyone not even a little bit and Spiderman often scolded him for “hitting them too hard” still it was fun. And sometimes Spiderman would even let him buy him food and they would sit together while Wade rambled and Spiderman wolfed down his food like the starved little college student that he was. They were practically dating. 
[You wish he just tolerates you because he doesn't want us killing any of his precious widdle baddies or he's hungry]
 “Like I said 'practically' dating” The merc chided with a pouty frown. Wade parked his bike in an alleyway a little ways from the Empire State Building and took the elevator to the roof stepping out on to the balcony he used the telescope to see if he could find the little hero in any of his near by haunts. ___________________________________ The mercenary searched all night but strangely enough couldn't find the little spider anywhere. He was taking a small breather on a roof top in Koreatown when he felt someone watching him. Spinning around with his twin 45s aiming in the direction he figured the assailant was he groaned loudly in disappointment when Daredevil slowly emerged out of the inky darkness like a demon. 
{He is a demon}
 “I see you're back in town” The permanently brooding vigilante growled. 
[Yep totally a demon]
 
{Why is he so intense all the time, l
