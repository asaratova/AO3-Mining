Â Description: A two-toned brown swirled soap with a white star embedded in the middle. The darker swirl is vanilla scented, the lighter swirl is cinnamon scented and contains ground cinnamon. Top of the soap is decorated with cinnamon sticks and sugar.Soaping notes:Ingredients:Saponified olive oil, saponified coconut oil, water, sodium hydroxide, saponified castor oil, saponified shea butter, saponified cacao butter, ground cinnamon, vanilla fragrance oil, cinnamon essential oil, cinnamon sticks, sugar, brown oxide, charcoal.Central star is an embed made of the same basic soap recipe, and left unfragranced and uncoloured. Made using a mould. This was my first time soaping with ground cinnamon and cinnamon essential oil. The soap smells *amazing*, but I want to do some skin patch testing before I'm sure it is usable as a soap. I didn't expect the ground cinnamon to colour the batter, and was aiming for cream batter with brown flecks. The accidental end result was pleasing enough I didn't make another batch to correct the glitch.
