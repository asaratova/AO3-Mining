Chapter 1: The Journey Is The Destination
    


Notes:
Welcome to my slow burn. My Nothing to Something to Everything fic. This is a character driven story and is a marathon, not a sprint. Looking for something light, short, and face-paced? This isn't it. This story deals with serious issues and themes and heavy topics. Please mind the tags. Hermione is our wonderful yet unreliable narrator. She is analytical, detailed oriented, and if you're expecting 30+ to talk and behave like they did in canon where they are 17/18, this might not be for you. People don't immediately drop all their defenses and issues, or shed the armor they spent years constructing in the moment the romantic lead shows up and notices them. The burn is "timeline fast" but "word count slow" and begins 13 years after the war with Draco and Hermione as absolutely nothing to each other. Please note the dates as it is significant to the timeline of events. And with no further ado.

  OneThe Journey Is The Destination
 March 13, 2011 
The quietest people have the loudest minds.Hermione had always found the quote thought-provoking, not only because it was true, but also because she couldn't think of a more accurate statement to describe Theodore Nott.He had never been loud—always reading and studying—which was something Hermione appreciated. As an adult, his pensive nature had transformed into the sort that frustrated most people, but never her. It kept Hermione alert, drew her attention, and constantly made her wonder what he was really thinking.Some people were quiet because they had nothing happening in their minds, some had too much, but Theo's silence was neither. In fact, his squinty green eyes and purposefully understated presence reminded Hermione of yet another quote:
It takes one to know one.
And because she knew exactly what that look meant, she was well aware that Theo was scheming.Hermione allowed it as she sorted through the crumbs she'd picked up over her last six years working for him—clues he'd inadvertently dropped that spoke of his intentions when he wouldn't.Whatever Theo wanted from her today was important to him.Personal.She didn't like it one bit.Theo didn't discuss anything remotely personal.Not with her or anyone else—at least not while they were at work.Pansy was the exception, but they were lifelong friends. Hermione suspected that his strict division between work and play was the only belief he hadn't shed after the war. Everything was business and had been since he'd spent his family's entire fortune buying and reviving the bankrupt hospital in a move that, while altruistic, was also far more lucrative than anyone had expected.That had been eight years ago, when Theodore Nott, Sr died during a prison break, and his son had been left alone, desperate to atone for the sins of his father.Anything that could make Theo, of all people, change the well-established status quo was certainly not an endeavour Hermione wanted to undertake. Instead, she watched him, her answer to his unasked question ready.Theo's office was large with neutral walls, light wood floors, and sparse furniture and décor. The artificial lights gave the room a clinical glow. Even with Pansy's attempts at adding bits of masculine flair by way of artwork, rugs, and the black dragon-hide sofa in the designated sitting area across the room, it still wasn't particularly grand.Hermione thought it fit Theo.Except one thing.A children's dictionary sat alone on the corner of his desk.That didn't fit.The man himself stood at the bookshelf, skimming over the assortment of spines and pulling off a book here and there. Theo was as tall as Ron and handsome in a way that made it clear he was aware of it, but had never needed to use it for his benefit. He was too smart for that.Honestly, Hermione had looked at him once or twice—she wasn't blind—and she might have subtly hinted at her interest. Theo was her type, now that she understood herself better. He had an odd sense of humour, was put together and astute, level-headed but decisive, and had the bonus of being tall and extremely attractive.Theo, on the other hand, had never shown interest outside of friendship. And that was that.But it never stopped her from looking appreciatively.As well as critically.Dressed in fitted grey trousers and a crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, Theo exuded a tactical calm that masqueraded as stoic indifference. But Hermione knew better. She waited patiently for him to remember that he wasn't dealing with his normal ilk."I'm quite busy, Theo."He responded by bringing his selected books back to his desk before he sat down, opening the first with the ease of a man that didn't have a meeting with the hospital board in twenty-seven minutes—twenty of which he would need to debate with her on the topic of whatever he was scheming about.He didn't have a lot of time to spare, yet he f
