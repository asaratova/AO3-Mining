Chapter 1: "Asshole"
    




Chapter Text
“Professor?” The eleven year old boy asked, almost hugging the doorframe.“Come in Harry, have a seat.” The Headmaster pointed to one of the two comfy back-winged chairs on the other side of his desk. Harry sank into it looking both scared and curious. The boy couldn’t keep his eyes off the knick-knacks that cluttered the large mahogany desk. He’d never been inside the Headmaster’s office before and he almost forgot the reason for his visit.“Would you like some tea?” the Headmaster asked, getting up from his sitting position and placing a few files in his desk drawer. “I have a very fruity strawberry tea that just came in today," he said before harry could answer. “How many sugars do you take?”“Er, two please.” Harry played with the cuff of his robe while the Headmaster busied with the tea. In no time at all, Harry had a steaming cup of strawberry tea in front of him. He continued twisting the cuff of his robe, leaving the tea untouched while the headmaster took a sip of his own. “Umm…”“We must always remember, Harry, who it is we are addressing,” Dumbledore cut him off. “I believe Professor Snape may have goaded you on a bit, to be sure, but that doesn’t excuse what you said. Professor Snape is deserving of your respect and to call him such a thing, even when angered, is not acceptable behavior. I’m afraid Professor Snape was in the right having ordered you to come see me.”The boy looked up from his tea, meeting the Headmaster’s gaze. “I didn’t mean to. It was an accident. It just sort of…slipped out,” he finished, looking sheepishly at his full cup of tea once more.The Headmaster stood up and made his way over to Harry. When he was no more than a foot from Harry’s chair, he made a motion for the boy to get up. After Harry stood, Dumbledore placed both his hands on Harry’s shoulders, his gaze intense.“Harry, the word you used- that you called Professor Snape- that is a very bad word. I don’t know where you learned such a foul word, but I never want any of my staff to report you using such language again, am I clear?”Harry dropped his head in fear. The grip on his shoulders didn’t hurt exactly, and the Headmaster’s gaze wasn’t mean, just serious. Even so, Harry never liked being scolded by teachers he liked. If it were Snape, Harry would have just glared back and taken his punishment. This was different; he didn’t want Professor Dumbledore to think badly of him. He was scared the kind, grandfatherly mentor would never again talk to him the way he used to, would always be ashamed of him. Like Harry was already ashamed of himself. He should have held his tongue when Snape started speaking badly of his father after Harry’s potion exploded. The Slytherin’s were laughing at him and he was so embarrassed with the entire incident, that he yelled that at least his father wasn’t a complete asshole. That did it. Snape took fifty points from Gryffindor and told him to go to the Headmaster’s office. He’d learned the word from his uncle. Uncle Vernon used to yell bad words at the sports players on the telly, and sometimes at Harry.“Harry?”Harry looked back up at the Headmaster. His eyes were starting to water. “Y-yes. I’m sorry Professor. It’ll never happen again, I swear,” he said, dropping his head back down.“I certainly hope not. At least, it seems you understand that what you did was very wrong and regret your actions,” Dumbledore said, kinder. “But we still have the matter of your punishment I’m afraid.”Albus Dumbledore was anything but afraid. In fact it took much-too-much effort to conceal his giddiness. He knew it was a good idea to give Severus a teaching position at Hogwarts, he just hadn’t known until now how good, and not just for the order. He’s just so good at goading the boy; the beautiful raven-haired nymph standing no more than a foot away with his bottom lip between his teeth. So shy, so scared, so inviting. He knew he wanted him the moment he walked in the double doors of Hogwarts, no maybe before that. The child was a hero, the chosen one; defeating one of the most powerful dark wizards in history without needing to lift a finger. It made the power-hungry Headmaster hard. He just wasn’t able to get his hands on the boy until today. Harry Potter was just too good. Not perfect, but he never did anything to warrant getting sent to his office. But now...“My boy, we must give you a punishment that fits your crime. And I’ve just thought of the perfect thing.” Dumbledore waved his wand and all the papers, knick-knack’s, tea, anything that had been on the headmaster’s desk, vanished. “I believe in muggle households, they have a custom where foul language is punished by having the child wash their mouth out with soap. Come here,” he patted his desk.“Sir, the-““Yes Harry, the desk. Come sit on top of my desk so we can begin your punishment.” Harry climbed up onto the desk. The Headmaster repositioned him so that he was facing his own chair. The old wizard remained stand
