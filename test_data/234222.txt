Â His cloak was soaked within minutes. Three Impervius Charms, several Drying Spells and one Conjured umbrella later, even his pants were wet.Draco tugged at his hood to pull it as low as it would go so that at least his face would be spared from the merciless rain. He half-expected the cloud to fly downward, peek beneath the hood and spew rain into his eyes. At this point, it would not have surprised him. When Draco had Conjured the umbrella on his way to the hospital wing, the cloud had engulfed his head, filling his nose and mouth with fog cold as ghost, and Draco had panicked so fiercely he had Vanished the umbrella with a mere thought."At least there's no thunder," Goyle said bracingly, perched on one of the empty beds that was on a safe distance away from Draco and his rain-spitting cloud.Draco groaned. He wished Goyle hadn't said that. It had sounded more prophetic than comforting. Not to mention the cloud seemed suspiciously sentient. If Draco braved looking up at it, he would surely have seen it perk up at the word thunder. The last thing he needed was getting struck by lightning."Oh dear," Madam Pomfrey said when she burst into the hospital wing. "You poor thing. You'll need loads of Pepper-Up, mark my word." She rushed to Draco's side, wand in hand. "You've always been a bit delicate.""Delicate?" Draco spluttered, outraged."Meteolojinx Recanto!" Pomfrey cried, then, when nothing happened, cleared her throat and tried again. "Meteolojinx Recanto!"Draco sucked in a breath, alarmed. "Professor Flitwick already tried that," he snapped. "You were supposed to have a better idea." Pomfrey's fingers tightened around her wand and Draco quickly added, "Madam."Pomfrey's next three spells were cast non-verbally, but Draco easily recognised Finite Incantatem, Evanesco and, to Draco's utter horror, the Impervius Charm, which meant Pomfrey had already given up on reversing the spell and instead concentrated on dealing with side-effects. When she Summoned the Pepper-Up Potion, Draco lost his patience. He leaped from the bed, splaying water everywhere. Pomfrey took a quick step back."I don't have a cold and I don't need Pepper-Up! I have a giant cloud above my person and I would appreciate it if you could remove it." The cloud in question rumbled threateningly. Draco thought he saw a quick, bright flash out of the corner of his eye, but he dared not look up.Pomfrey nodded, unperturbed. "Yes, just as I expected," she said and Summoned a Calming Draught. "A spoonful of Pepper-Up every morning, and a spoonful of Calming Draught every six hours," she ordered.Draco resisted the urge to stomp his feet. "It's a botched spell," he said through clenched teeth, "not a medical condition.""Is that your professional opinion, Mr Malfoy?""It's fucking common sense!" Draco shouted. A flash of bright light was unmistakable this time. The hair on the back of Draco's neck stood out and he was sure he felt a sharp stab of electricity rush through him. Or it could have merely been panic.Pomfrey's eyebrows rose so high they threatened to reach her hairline. "I'd recommend using a very big spoon." She sniffed and handed Draco the potions. He had little choice but to take them. It was the only remedy that was offered. "You're excused from your classes for today," she added, and Goyle whooped, hopping down from the bed. "As for you, Mr Goyle," Pomfrey said loudly, "you have completed your escorting duties and may return to your class."Goyle looked so crestfallen Draco took pity on him."My delicate nature requires moral support," he proclaimed solemnly.Draco strongly suspected Pomfrey was fighting the urge to roll her eyes. "Very well, then." She sighed. "Off you go."Goyle still looked miserable and Draco splashed his way towards him: his shoes were filled with water, making him regret he had sat on the bed; the cloak would have protected his feet if he had remained standing."That means no classes for you, after all. You're my moral support," Draco said impatiently. Then he replayed his own words in his mind. They felt like a punch in the stomach when he recognised the truth of them. Goyle was his moral support. He was the only friend left to him in this wretched castle. Now there's a depressing thought.Goyle seemed too confused to regain his earlier cheerfulness. "What do moral supports do?" he asked, heavy brow furrowed.Draco considered the question. Goyle always asked the strangest things. "Eat chocolate and make small talk," he said at last.Goyle grinned, looking highly relieved. "I can do that.""Come on," Draco said, with a last irritated glance at Madam Pomfrey.There was an unnerving look in her eyes when she said, much too kindly, "Check in first thing tomorrow morning, dear, and we'll see if the Charm will be more cooperative."Draco nodded, frowning at her. He wondered if she had read his thoughts and felt sorry for him. I have many friends outside of this school and they're all rich and powerful, he thought at her, just
