Chapter 1





Chapter Text
“Loops.”“Loops.”“Loops.”Each fist bump came with the name as Remus stood by the door after morning skate. He smiled at each of them, even the ones breathing too hard to actually say anything.“How’s the thigh feel?” He asked a sweaty Kasey as he waddled in with his goalie pads, helmet perched on top of his head.Kasey shrugged. “Little tight. Might be in later.”Remus nodded. “Good. Do some heat before, alright? I’ll work it out.”He nodded, waving his blocker behind his shoulder as he headed towards his stall.“Remus Mother Fucking Lupin.” Remus heard a second before he was being taken beneath a very sweat-damp arm.Remus groaned. “James.”“Did you see my goal? See me steal it from Pads?”Remus elbowed him hard in the ribs, right where his pads ended above his hockey pants. James grunted and let go.“Yes, very pretty.”“Right?” James grinned, then turned to walk backwards farther into the locker room. “Hey, re-tape my shoulder later? Before I go?”“Sure thing.”James winked at him. “Thanks, Fruit-Loop.”Remus rolled his eyes, but smiled back at him. He would allow that the nickname was ridiculous, but he couldn’t deny that he loved it. He was part of this team, even if he wasn’t an actual player.He looked back to the hall and frowned. “Hey, Pots,” he called out, and James looked up. He was already stripped down to his underarmour. “Where’s Black?”James hesitated and a few of the other guys looked up, too.“Captain’s still on the ice.” He finally said, sharing a knowing look with Remus.Remus nodded. “Right. Thanks.” Sirius was right where James had said he would be, doing slow loops around the rink that would abruptly end, exploding into a break away up the ice, puck slick on his stick and whipped into the goal. Again. Again. Again. Remus sat at the sidelines, waiting for Sirius to see him first. It took him five more goals. While he wasn’t looking, Remus watched his face. So intense. So intent on pretending he wasn’t favoring his right ankle like he was. Remus sat on the bench and folded his elbows on the boards.“Want to share something with the class there, Loops?”Remus shook his head. “Just you. No need to alert the media.”Sirius skated over, ducking out of his helmet and coming to a hard stop in front of Remus. “Well?” He said, leaning on the boards just beside Remus, mirroring his position.“You’re still favoring your foot.”“Damn it, Remus.”Remus spread his hands. “If I don’t point it out, who will?”Sirius looked away with a shake of his head. The cardinal red and gold of his jersey set off his tan skin against the ice.“Padfoot.” Remus sighed. “I wouldn’t point it out of I didn’t think I had to.”“I want—” Sirius pressed his lips together.“You want to be ready.”“I need to be ready.” Sirius looked back to Remus. “I’m their captain, Re.”Remus fought back a shaky breath. It always startled him, knocked the wind out of him a little, when Sirius called him that. It felt more intimate, more like they knew each other, like they were friends. Rather than Remus just being his physical therapist. And not even his, at that. The team’s.“You’re my captain, too.” Remus smiled, tilting his head down a little. “Speaking as a fan, that is.”It made Sirius laugh, which made Remus have to busy himself with pretending to straighten some stray water bottles left behind to hide the way his cheeks and neck heated.“Let me look at it after you shower, alright? That’s it. I know you want to be ready, and I promised you I’d do everything in my power to get you there. I intend to keep that promise, but you have to tell me when you’re not feeling one hundred percent.” Remus raised his eyebrows. “You have to be honest with me.”Sirius nodded exaggeratedly as he unlatched the bench door, grumbling. “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” But he smiled again. “Thanks, Loops.”“Sure.” Remus nodded.As Sirius walked towards the locker room, Remus tried to reason with his flopping heart. ~ It was cliche, was the thing.Remus muttered to himself about it back home, microwaving himself some left over chicken and rice. A trainer falling for the heartthrob captain. Not to mention that it was Sirius Black. Sirius was always getting ribbed by the team that anyone who looked at him fell for him. Remus tried to laugh along when it was brought up at the occasional team dinner he was invited out to.It was a hard thing to do.It was cliche and it was pathetic. He sat down in front of his couch so he could more easily eat at the low coffee table and turned on the TV. As the season approached, the NHL network was ramping up stat comparisons and player profiles. Among all the rookies, the press couldn’t seem to resist doing what seemed like their monthly story on “The Rival Captains.” Sirius’ face was splashed up on the screen besides Snape’s. Remus rolled his eyes.“Of course,” the reporter was saying, “the hockey world is more than eager for one of the first match ups of the 2019 NHL season, between the Gryffindor Lions and the Slytherin Snakes.”“Not to mention,”
