Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Life was good, Harry decided as he lazed on the sunny beach without a worry in the world. He had more money and fame than he knew what to do with, and his successful Quidditch career left him plenty of time during off-season to pursue whatever caught his fancy. Not too shabby for a boy who grew up in a cupboard—and he owed most of it to his gorgeous fiancée, Fleur.They had first met during the disastrous Triwizard Tournament. She wasn't too impressed with the "leetle boy", but he soon blew her expectations away by displaying skill and tenacity that allowed him to compete with the older champions as an equal. He even saved Fleur's little sister during the second task. Years later, she admitted that Harry had looked like a dashing hero to her when he emerged from the lake with Gabrielle in his arms. Of course, nothing more happened back then; the gap between them was too wide, and with Voldemort's return, Harry had other things on his mind.Fleur had eventually written to him under the pretense of relaying Gabrielle's thanks. The two began exchanging letters, and Harry found himself opening up to her like no one else. He felt that she really understood him, although he had no idea why a beautiful girl was acting so friendly towards someone like him. Oh, he could see the not-so-subtle hints in her letters now, but back then he had just been too clueless.Then Fleur came to England to intern at Gringotts in Harry's sixth year, and everything changed. He grinned every time he recalled their first Hogsmeade dates, which were full of awkward fumbling, blushing, and tentative smiles. Fleur knew what she wanted, but she didn't have much in the way of dating experience, whereas Harry was just too unsure of himself, refusing to believe that someone like Fleur Delacour could like him back. Still, he mustered his Gryffindor courage one day and kissed her.The rest, as they say, was history. Motivated like never before, he threw himself into his studies and dedicated all his time (except for when he was sneaking out to meet his girlfriend) to improving himself. In the end, Voldemort never stood a chance against him and his allies.Harry, having had his fill of Dark wizards, went on a lengthy trip around the continent with Fleur, after which he returned to England to play professional Quidditch. He eventually proposed to her after obtaining permission from her parents, who were old money purebloods. At twenty-one, he was in no hurry to marry, but at least being engaged got the hordes of fangirls off his back.And now he was on a private beach in southern France, watching two topless sisters frolic in the surf. Yup, life was pretty great.Harry shaded his eyes with his hand, languidly observing the Delacour siblings squeal in delight as they splashed water on each other. Veela heritage was evident in their striking features, flawless skin, and lustrous hair—Fleur's an ethereal silvery-blonde, and Gabrielle's shining with a golden hue. They both had lithe and graceful figures, Fleur's curvier than her sister's who hadn't quite finished growing into her womanly form yet.Harry shook his head and averted his gaze. Ogling his fiancée's sixteen-year-old sister was entirely inappropriate—and besides, Fleur's jiggling jubblies were not only safer, but also more fun to leer at. He amused himself doing just that, until Fleur ended the show by wading in for a swim, while Gabrielle made her way towards him. Harry sighed and lay back on the towel, listening to the crunch of footsteps rapidly draw closer."Hey, Harry," Gabrielle chirped, sounding a little out of breath.He did his best to keep his eyes on her face rather than her heaving chest. "Hey, you. Not going for a swim?""I'm getting a little burnt here. Put some sunscreen on my back, please?""Er..." He searched for Fleur with his eyes as if intending to seek her permission, but she was still out in the water. Wait, why was he getting so flustered over this? "Sure."Gabby plopped prone on the towel and Harry gently massaged some soothing lotion onto her warm skin. "Your back does look a little red. Maybe you should stay under the parasol for now.""Merci, Harry," she said, rolling over. "I'll do the front myself.""Anytime." He handed over the sunscreen bottle, then hastily turned away when Gabrielle began to diligently rub the lotion onto her breasts. He thought he saw her smirk, but chalked it up to his imagination. "Um, I'll just go for a dip."Harry bid a swift retreat and marched into the refreshingly cool water until he was deep enough to swim. He raced towards Fleur with strong, steady strokes. The reason for his agitation eluded him—this certainly wasn't the first time he was on a topless beach—so he decided to work off the excess energy and put himself as far away from the source of his unease as possible.He caught up to Fleur and surprised her by giving her a hug and making them plunge briefly under water.Surfacing, she punched his chest lightly. "Harry!""
