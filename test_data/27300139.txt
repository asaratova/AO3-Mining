Chapter Text

When you're young you don't think about

How good things have a bad side

You spend your time waiting around

For the fall not the goodbye

When you're naive and so green

It makes it hard to believe

How life works when you're older
- Laura Zocca, The Art Of Getting By  Remus knows that happiness isn’t natural to him. Oh, he’s had glimpses of it. For a few short years he’d convinced himself that it was something he could hold in his hands, carve into his life like the etchings on a map. He had laughed often, abrasively, disgustingly joyful. Loved recklessly. Sometimes he can still feel the way it had sat in his chest and crinkled in the corner of his eyes. But a life like his can’t contain joy for long. He’d sensed it even then, pressing on the windows of Hogwarts. The outside slowly creeping in. James would smile it all away.  It will be okay Moony,  he’d say.  As long as the Marauders stick together. And he’d throw his arm across Remus’s shoulders and reel him back into whatever scheme they were conjuring up. After...  after, Remus remembers the way Lily would try to smooth over any worry. Would hold them together, tentatively, like they were all precious. Maybe she was the only one who knew how breakable they were. It makes Remus want to cry, but then... he hasn’t done that in a long time either. *When Remus apparates to his front door and sees Dumbledore and McGonagall waiting patiently, he almost wants to turn around and walk the other way. He knows what he looks like. His clothes are old, worn and wrinkled. He stinks of smoke and sex. He is scraped empty, a bag of bones and a fresh scar on his face that catches the light. It’s been nearly three years since... and they have not been kind years to him. Remus sighs, resignedly walks forward. Then he shudders to a stop. Between the two professors is a little boy. He’s so small, Remus almost missed him hiding in the robes that swarm around him. He has messy, jet-black hair and dark skin. His eyes are green and round. His clothes hang off him and his face has a mottled, angry bruise across one cheek. Remus can feel his breath leave his body. It’s been so long since he’s seen –  before... fuck. His eyes flash up to Dumbledore’s. He is wrenched apart and adrift and much too hungover to deal with this. “We have one last thing to ask of you, Mr Lupin,” says Dumbledore calmly. *Once he has a cup of tea in his hands – with an added splash of whiskey that has McGonagall frowning at the bruises on his knuckles – he feels less like his world is falling around his ears.Harry,  Merlin it’s Harry, is playing on the floor, scribbling with some pencils that Dumbledore has conjured up from who knows where. “The boy isn’t safe with them,” Minerva says. “I thought as much when we dropped him off, that terrible night. So I went back to check after Christmas, and as you can see...” she trails off. Remus looks at Harry again, at the hand-shaped bruise on his face and the ones Dumbledore say curl around his arms. Dursley did have big, meaty hands... that one time Remus met him. Anger burns at the back of his throat as he swallows his whiskey-tea.“What do you want me to do?” Remus says, tiredly. All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can’t stop looking at Harry. “Remus...” Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone. Hates that he knows it will hurt. “There is no one else left.” A bitter laugh escapes him. “So you’ll curse the poor thing with a werewolf for a guardian?” He stands up, can’t bear to sit across from the two commanders of a war that he is still not recovered from. “Surely Molly Weasley has a place in her home for another one?” “She has a young baby and six other children, Remus.” “The halls of Hogwarts, then.”“Cold stone and no one to call his own?” Dumbledore looks over his half-moon glasses at him. Delivers a deadly blow. “James would have wanted...” Remus snarls. “Don’t tell me what Ja... don’t tell me what he would have wanted, because it certainly wouldn’t be this.” He clenches his hands around his tea cup and looks at Harry. The boy is staring at him now, wide-eyed. Remus forces himself not to think of Lily. He turns back to the people who welcomed a young werewolf into their school. Made sure he was warm and safe in Gryffindor tower. Assigned him to a dormitory with... he still can’t bear to think of them. It still hurts too much, like a bad dream. Like another life, best to forget. But he can’t, not with Harry staring at him. “I have  nothing,” Remus’s voice cracks. “Nothing left. You have given and taken it all.” McGonagall frowns and Remus can’t bear the fucking pity of it. When Dumbledore looks at him gravely, he knows that he is going to pull at the tatters left of his life anyway. “Maybe it is Harry who will give something to you.”*
