Chapter Text
Harry smiled, reached out and tugged a stray strand of longish dark-blond hair behind Stefan’s ear. Stefan instinctively lowered his head and Harry clicked his tongue in mild disapproval.“You can look at me, pet,” he encouraged and Stefan slowly lifted his head to reveal a hesitant but beautifully innocent smile. Harry reached for Stefan’s hand and circled his thumb gently over the pulse point on his wrist.“Caleb is a good man, he’ll take good care of you, Stefan. You do know that, don’t you?” he reminded the young, slightly insecure man who stood before him and Stefan nodded in understanding and agreement.Harry had spent the last three months training Stefan, teaching him all he needed to know about being submissive, and especially being a submissive for Caleb. Compared to his previous charges, it hadn’t been all that much of a challenge since Stefan was naturally submissive, relished in following orders and just needed a little guidance, as well as a steady hand.They had met with Caleb a few times over the last two weeks and both Caleb and Stefan seemed rather smitten with each other, although Stefan was still somewhat shy whenever he was around his new Dom. Harry had no doubt that both Caleb and Stefan wouldn’t take long to get properly acquainted. He had known Caleb for a little over five years and had the utmost faith in him.“I know, Sir.”Harry chuckled and his eyes twinkled with amusement.“I’m not your Dom anymore, pet, best not upset Caleb now, hm? He might just get jealous…” Harry glanced at Caleb, who sat in a comfortable armchair with one leg thrown over the other, waiting patiently, a content smile playing around his lips. They shared a smile; Harry raised a questioning eyebrow and Caleb nodded approvingly.Several years of friendship meant that Harry didn’t necessarily need words to communicate with Caleb. Following the silent exchange, Harry engulfed Stefan in a tight, comforting hug.Stefan almost automatically moved his arms as if to return the embrace, but he hesitated and awkwardly held them mid-air instead.“You can hug me,” Harry permitted and Stefan gratefully returned the hug, melted into the embrace and Harry silently counted to five, then disentangled himself and stepped back.“It’s time, pet,” he said firmly, gave Caleb one last nod, then turned and made his way towards the door. He heard Caleb calling out to his new sub, but did not turn around to watch the first proper exchange between Stefan and his new Dom. It wasn’t for his eyes or ears, that moment was theirs and theirs alone.Instead, he swiftly pulled the door open, left the spacious flat and slowly descended the three flights of stairs. He hated goodbyes. They always reminded him of that time, long ago, when David had left him. He had felt so confused and lost in the weeks following their separation and some of that sentiment still lingered behind.It only ever really surfaced when he found himself saying goodbye to someone he cared about and Harry knew that he would be back to his usual self well before dinner, but for now, he allowed himself a moment of vulnerability. One couldn’t always be tough and in charge of everything.To him, training a new submissive was like an exceptionally good Quidditch match; it was wild, unpredictable, full of endless possibilities and opportunities to grow and learn. Introducing a well-trained submissive to their new Master, however, it felt a bit like sending your child off to study at Hogwarts, or so Harry imagined.Those last few moments on Platform 9¾, just after everyone had boarded the Hogwarts Express and the train pulled out of the station to take the students away to another year filled with magic, spells, potions, charms, and transfiguration.Remembering his own excitement each year, Harry tried to look at it from the other side. He imagined excited parents, finally being able to enjoy a bit of peace and quiet. The fantasy was sweet enough but it still filled Harry with a sense of melancholy.Teddy was due to start Hogwarts in a few years and Harry dreaded the idea of sending his godson away for the better part of the year. He dreaded it so much that he pushed the mere thought of it to the furthest, darkest corner of his mind and locked it away.Ignorance is bliss, he thought.It really wasn’t, but when it came to sending Teddy away to Hogwarts, logical thinking wasn’t exactly Harry’s strong point. He excelled at it in all other areas of his life, especially when it came to exerting dominance, but Teddy was most definitely his Achilles’ heel.Once outside the impressive-looking building of expensive flats, Harry took a deep breath, looked up at the blue sky and smiled.Everything will be all right, he mused, enjoying the warm spring afternoon too much not to let the happiness soak through his skin and settle into his bones. With a slight spring in his step, he walked down the road, tur
