Chapter 1: Chapter One
    




Chapter Text
Harry woke with a sharp breath and cruel laughter ringing in his ears.He stared at the ceiling of his dimly lit bedroom for an endless second, memories still dancing along the edges of his sight, and his skin prickled as the early morning air hit his sweat-covered body.Bile rose in his throat, and Harry shot upright, wrestling with his sheets as he rushed to get to the bathroom. He barely made it in time to empty his stomach in the toilet.He coughed, spitting the last of the foul, burning liquid from his mouth, and wiped the back of his hand over his lips.He stayed there for a full minute, hunched over the bowl and waiting for his stomach to settled, before standing and flushing. He slowly stepped up to the sink and raked his fingers through his hair, breathing deeply.“Harry?”His shirt was sticking to him uncomfortably, and his hair was plastered to his neck and forehead. Harry quickly yanked the night shirt off and tossed it to the side, leaning over the sink and staring at the mirror intently.He looked like a mess.“…Harry?”“In here,” he called, knowing she would find him eventually and that there was no point trying to pretend nothing had happened. She had likely heard him throwing up.“Harry, are you alright?”His gaze switched from his reflection to Ginny’s. She was standing in the doorway, wrapped in the same gorgeous black lace sleeping gown that he had delighted in taking her out of last night. Her hair was up in a loose bun and her face freshly washed, meaning she had been up for some time already.“Yeah,” he croaked, then immediately cleared his throat to get rid of the grit in his voice. “Yeah, just…just a nightmare.”“Nightmare, or memory?” She asked as she glided towards him, coming to a stop just behind him. Her hands, calloused and warm, landed gently on his back, rubbing the tense muscles there absently.Her familiar scent surrounded him, and when he exhaled next, he let some of his tension go. “Is there a difference?” Harry huffed.Ginny pressed a kiss to his shoulder, watching him carefully. “The war?”He shook his head.“Voldemort?”“No,” he swallowed, grimacing at the lingering taste. “Bellatrix. The ministry. Sirius.”She perched her chin on his shoulder, hands snaking around his waist. Harry stared at her arms to give his mind something to focus on. The difference between her fair skin and his own darker shade was stark.She tilted her head, probing but not demanding. Ginny always knew how to handle him.“I just kept seeing him fall through the veil,” he whispered, closing his eyes as he felt despair well in his gut. “Over and over, and all I could hear was her laughing.”She hummed, thumb stroking along his hip in comfort. The soft puffs of her breaths against his bare skin grounded him in a way he could not describe.Harry sighed deeply, bowing his head for a moment before turning in her hold and wrapping his arms around her. “I’m sorry,” he murmured against her head. “Don’t be,” she replied, pressing another kiss to his collarbone. “It happens to all of us. Are you feeling better?”He slumped more in her hold, “Yes.”“Then that’s all the matters at the moment.”Harry smiled within the confines of her hair, closing his eyes. This was why he loved her so, so much. Whenever he got caught up in his memories, whenever he felt like he was drowning and pulled in too many directions, Ginny made things simpler.“Thank you, Ms. Weasley,” he said gratefully.She patted him on the chest, pulling back enough to smile up at him. “You are very welcome, Mr. Potter.”Harry leaned down, laying a gentle kiss on her forehead that had her lightly pushing into him. “I probably should get ready,” he whispered. “Kingsley asked Ron and me to head in early today to talk the Summers’ case over. Hopefully we’ll finally get the bastard.”“Good,” Ginny said, vicious. “That bastard deserves to be thrown in Azkaban to rot.”Harry stepped back and brushed some of her loose hair behind her ear. “He’ll get a trial first, Gin. No more slips like with Sirius.”“You already know he’s guilty, Harry. You have so much evidence.”“Which, hopefully, means that things will go quickly, and he’ll be put away.”Ginny settled, her frown easing. “Alright, you have a shower, and I’ll finish up breakfast. We don’t want you to be late.”“Sounds good,” he kissed her one last time on the cheek, watching her smile bloom as she slipped back into the bedroom. The moment the door closed Harry’s smile fell. He looked back to the mirror and frowned. He never liked dreaming of Sirius’ death. He much preferred remembering the man when he’d been alive – alive and vibrant and there. It was probably just the stress from the case, Harry knew. He and Ron had been working on it for weeks at this point, from the very first moment Summers’ niece had been sent into Saint Mungo’s; and every day the stress of knowing the man had not been caught yet ate at him. He supposed it was only natural that his dreams would be plagued by memories o
