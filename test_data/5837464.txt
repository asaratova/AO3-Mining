Chapter 1: The Miseducation of Hermione Granger
    




Chapter Text
Severus Snape stalked the desolate halls of Hogwarts, prowling its hidden corners for rule breakers and troublemakers. Any students found out after curfew would be immensely sorry if caught by the dreaded Potions master. As his shift was almost over, Severus had worked his way toward the dungeons. Turning down a dimly lit corridor that led to a secret passageway to his office, he heard a muffled moan that was entirely out of place. Halting all movement, Snape held his breath and narrowed his eyes, waiting for the sound to guide him to the miscreants. The muffled whimpers of teenage fornication met his ears, and he followed the moaning to a large tapestry depicting a gory goblin rebellion, which hid a shortcut to the kitchens. The soft noises continued just behind the thick material.Severus took a deep breath and yanked the tapestry aside. Blaise Zabini blinked up at him, looking coolly surprised by the interruption. Still pinned to the wall was an as-yet-unidentified girl, her leg hooked around Zabini’s hip; Blaise’s body kept her hidden. Sighing in annoyance, Snape rolled his eyes. “Zabini, get back to the common room.”Blaise slunk away as fast as possible, a small smirk on his face. It wasn’t the first time the Potions master had caught Zabini with some horny little witch, and he doubted it would be the last. With Zabini gone, Snape’s attention fell back on the girl in question. Wide brown eyes peered up at him through curly brown tendrils. He would have recognized her immediately had she worn her hair down, but she had it pulled back off her face for a change.“Well, well. Look who we have here.” A sneer curled his lip. “The golden girl of Gryffindor.”Hermione stood defeated before him, wishing she could be anyplace else.“Miss Granger, I’m surprised at you,” he chided. “Out past curfew doing Merlin-knows-what with the biggest womanizer Slytherin has seen since Lucius Malfoy himself.” Snape grabbed Hermione’s arm and dragged her toward his office. “Won’t Professor McGonagall be interested to hear all about this? And your little Gryffindor friends, won’t they be surprised to find out you’ve been fraternizing with the enemy after hours?”Hermione winced more at the glee in his voice than the tight grip on her arm. Upon arrival to his office, he flung her into the chair that sat before his desk. “I’ll just Floo Professor McGonagall and ask her to come here straight away."Hermione reached out in a pitiful attempt to stop him. “Please, Professor Snape, don’t tell. I’ll do anything."To Hermione’s surprise, he paused and looked back at her. His eyes narrowed, studying her.After several silent seconds, Severus raised an eyebrow in thought. Whatever her reasons were, he could only imagine. Although, she would be quite the talk of the school if this got out. “Anything, Miss Granger? You do realize with whom you're trying to make a deal, don’t you?”Hermione flinched from his cold expression, her brain screaming at her that making deals with ex-Death Eaters was NOT a good idea. And the man before her was one she knew would take great pleasure in seeing her humiliated. On the other hand, she didn’t want rumors of her private life to get out. Disappointing McGonagall would tear her apart, and she’d never be able to explain why she’d been found in a compromising position with a Slytherin. Her friends would never forgive her. Especially Ron. He’d never ever understand. Hermione sighed in resignation. “Yes, I know. If you’ll keep this between us, I’ll accept any punishment you chose.”Free to punish her in any manner he chose? Had Christmas come again already? He’d fantasized about getting back at the golden trio properly, but he never dreamed it could be a reality. A malicious grin spread across his face. “Then you’re not nearly as intelligent as they claim you to be. Get up.”Hermione stood from the straight-backed chair. She knew whatever he had in store for her would be torturous. She tried to steel herself for what might be coming. Slugs, Bubotuber pus, peeling Boomslang skins—whatever he chose was bound to be awful.Snape grabbed her arm and spun her around. He sat in the chair, and Hermione realized, far to late, that she was being pulled down across his lap. It happened so fast and was so completely unexpected that she couldn't even begin to fathom what he might be doing. When she felt her skirt being pushed toward her waist, it suddenly dawned on her.“Wait, sir,” Hermione gasped, trying to free herself. “Please don’t!”Snape held her in place. “Miss Granger, you agreed to any punishment I saw fit. Are you going back on your word? Shall I go now and fetch your Head of House?”Hermione stopped struggling and thought a moment before slumping in defeat. “No, sir.”The smirk permanently planted itself on his face as he admired the round arse on his lap. He’d found an unplanned bonus upon lifting her skirt. Expecting sensible white cotton knickers, he found b
