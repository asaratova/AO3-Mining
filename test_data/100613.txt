The two women at the next table giggled and chattered at each other like a pair of mockingbirds, filling the small cafe with their shrieks. Hermione sighed. Her quiet afternoon tea, her daily ritual of calm after a long workday, wasn't going to relax her much with that duo going on about shoes, shopping, and shags. The least they could do, she thought, was keep their voices down. Surely the men under discussion would prefer not to have their foibles and preferences bantered about in public. Then again - she glanced at the women as one extra-loud screech rang over the clatter of cups and saucers behind the counter at the front of the cafe - maybe they would. The two women were Pansy Parkinson and Astoria Greengrass, both from Slytherin house, and the fact that the Sorting Hat had never named arrogance and bragging as a Slytherin trait was clearly an oversight."Merlin's tits!" shouted Pansy, her pug nose less puggish these days after the attentions of a cosmetic Healer, as Witch Weekly had gleefully reported. "He's still trying that? I swear, he asked me for it at least a dozen times before I threatened to stuff a wand up his arse and see if he liked it."Hermione huffed and drank her tea quickly, even though it was a blend that should really be savored. She'd had just about enough of the Draco Malfoy Ex-Girlfriend Support Society.The willowy blonde beside Pansy snorted with laughter and gestured with her cup, slopping tea onto the tablecloth. "It's the truth. You were more patient than I was, though. I only let him ask for it twice before I told him it was never going to happen. He should count himself lucky I'd go down on him, much less anything else, especially since he's got that habit of--""Grabbing your hair!" both women chorused, laughing madly.Astoria leaned closer to Pansy. "Did he ever try tying you to the headboard?"Hermione froze, her eyes widening, and she cradled her teacup in both hands. She shouldn't be listening to this, shouldn't be eavesdropping, shouldn't be the slightest bit intrigued by the direction of the conversation. On the other hand, she told herself, this was a very good tea, and maybe she'd have a second cup. She certainly didn't want to hear more about Draco's proclivities, or what sounded very much like a tendency towards dominance. She wasn't interested in that at all. It was the tea that kept her glued to her seat.She told herself that as firmly as she could.Pansy shrieked and nodded, slapping the table with her hand, her rings jangling. "Yes," she hissed. "I told him straight out I wouldn't do that sort of thing. Or let him order me around. That's why I dropped him, you know. He wants some little thing to submit to his whims, he can find a mouse or a Hufflepuff. At least he was intelligent enough never to try that outside the bedroom."Hermione shifted her chair with a wide stretch of her arms to cover the movement. She opened a book on the table and bent over it, looking through her fringe at the two Slytherins. Keep talking, she demanded in silence. Talk about Draco more. Talk about this. She gave up on pretending she didn't want to hear more, gave up on the pretense that she wasn't interested. She wanted to hear everything. Wanted to know what Draco liked. It was starting to look as though they liked the same things.It was something she'd had no luck finding in her relationships. Not Ron, not Viktor, not Cormac, not one of the men she'd dated since school had been able to give her what she wanted. Not one had picked up on her hints, suggestions, or even her outright requests. Maybe it was wrong to think about this, maybe it was horrible to even consider, but if Draco Malfoy liked to dominate, she couldn't stop herself from picturing it. Picturing him.Astoria rolled her eyes. "Tell me about it. I didn't mind at first. It was a little exciting, I'll admit. When he'd order me to keep my hands still or demand that I, y'know, that I touch myself for him?"  Pansy nodded, humming in agreement, and Astoria continued. "But then he just got odd. On your knees, Astoria. Strip and wait for me, Astoria."Hermione sank her teeth into her bottom lip and wriggled on her chair. She replayed the statements in her head, replacing Astoria's name with her own. Draco's deep voice rolled through her mind. She could hear him giving her those orders, could picture his eyes going darker with each one. She had to fight not to breathe hard, but nothing could prevent her knickers from growing damp."Did he ever try to come on your face?" Pansy asked, and Hermione stifled a groan. She bolted down her tea, grabbed her book, and left the cafe, her face flaming hot.She nearly ran home, to her flat over Slug and Jiggers apothecary in Diagon Alley. She tossed her book and her bag on the table in the kitchenette and dove into her bedroom. Hermione sprawled across her bed, her skirt rucked up to her hips, and shoved her hand into her knickers. Eyes closed, she imagined Draco's voice in her ear, his bre
