Chapter 1: Chapter 1
    




Chapter Text
The world was divided into many different classifications and the most common of them was the general population, often shortened down into the gen. By some, to be anything but a gen is to be a freak. The people who think this are few and are seen as the lowest of the low in society. 
Petunia Dursley liked to consider herself perfectly middle class, thank you very much. Everything in her world was perfectly normal. She married a middle class gen man and together they had a lovely gen son. The only problem in Petunia’s perfect life came in the form of one Harry Potter. From the day they found him on their doorstep, they knew he would be trouble. Now, eleven years later with letters flying all over the house and owls perched on every tree and rooftop in the estate, Petunia felt as if all her concerns about taking in her sister’s son were coming to fruition.
It was bad enough that he wasn't a gen, but now he had to be even more of a freak, just like his parents. Luckily, Vernon found them a place to get away from all of the blasted owls and letters. It was just after twelve am on July thirty first that Petunia found out that they didn't get away at all.
**************************************************************************
Harry always knew he was different. His Aunt and Uncle never missed a chance to rub it in his nose that he wasn't a gen and made sure he knew how much of a freak he was. It didn't help that Dudley took his status as a personal affront and initiated the game of 'Harry Hunting'. Having not grown past three foot five inches, even at the age of ten, didn't help matters. Laying on the ground, looking at the small watch wrapped around Dudley's beefing wrist, Harry counted down the seconds to his birthday. He hugged his toy bunny close to his chest as the watch beeped twelve am. 
"Look Hoppy, I'm eleven years old now." Harry whispered into the bunny's soft fur. 
For some reason, the fur never lost its softness; no matter how many times his aunt tried to throw him away or Dudley tried to cut his ears off, he always ended up back in Harry's cupboard good as new. Harry thought it was special bunny magic that did it.  
"Okay, Hoppy, now it's time for all lit-big boys to go to sleep"  Harry corrected himself and turned over and tried to get comfortable on the cold ground.
 Just as he was about to close his eyes, he heard a knock on the door. The loudness of the knock gave Harry a fright and he whimpered and clutched his bunny tighter looking at the door. The knocked boomed again and Harry heard his uncle storming down the stairs. As he stomped past Harry and Dudley, who was shocked into wakefulness, Harry and Hoppy went to hide in a crevice by the fire. Harry peeked out just as his uncle opened the door; he wasn't able to see anything because his uncle’s huge form blocked the way, but he could hear the person.
"I am looking for a Mister Harry Potter." The smooth voice sounded scary, so Harry pushed himself into the hiding space a bit more. He was good at making himself unseen. 
***************************************************************************
This was really not Severus's night. The only reason he was here was because the Headmaster had requested that he go and collect the boy. He could be at home with Lucius and Draco, but here he was, on a horrible wet night, collecting Harry Potter. It didn't help that he had to listen to that oaf, Dursley. He never did like him, quite agreeing with Minerva when she said that they were the worst type of muggles. If it wasn't for Dumbledore's insistence that it was the best place for Harry, Severus would never have let them take care of him. 
"I won't have it! He's already enough of a freak. I won't have any more of his freakishness in this household! Leave at once!” Vernon's voice thundered. 
Severus raised a brow. "Do be quiet, Dursley, you idiot." Walking past Vernon into the small room, Severus looked around for Harry, not seeing him he turned back to Vernon. 
"Well? where is he?" 
"Why should I tell you?" Vernon replied petulantly. "You storm in here looking for the boy and don't give a toss about what I said. We refuse to let him go there. We aren't paying for it I tell you!" Vernon was purple by the end of his small rant. 
Severus ignored him and looked around the room. On the stairs, Petunia had her bony arms wrapped around a blonde pig-like boy. That had to be Dudley, he decided. He looked in no way like his Lily did or how Potter had for that matter. It was as he was turning back around to Vernon to demand some answers that he caught sight of movement out of the corner of his eye: it looked like the ear of a toy rabbit. Wondering why a toy caught his eye, he walked towards it. It was then that he heard a small whimper. As he got closer, he could make out the features of a young boy, who looked no more than four or five years old. His clothes were three sizes too big on him and he appeared malnourished.
