Chapter 1: Stress Relief
    




Chapter Text

Friday night, Gryffindor Common Room.
“We need to talk.”Harry looked up to find Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, two fellow Gryffindors staring at him.“Okay, what’s up?”“It’s about Hermione, she’s...” began Parvati.“... She’s a problem.” Lavender finished impatiently.Now worried, Harry glanced across the room to find Hermione sitting at a desk, surrounded by piles of books and parchment.“Did she try to get you to redo your potions essay again?” Harry asked with a smirk.A now red faced Lavender replied. “No!... Well yeah she did that too, but I’m talking about a more serious problem.”In a softer tone Parvati cut her off. “It’s not life or death Harry so don’t freak out, but we need your help before it gets worse.”Now concerned Harry glanced back at them. “Okay, what do you need? ““First of all, do you remember the talk McGonagall gave you boys at the start of the year?”“You mean about your...” Harry trailed off while glancing down at the two witches skirts.A now equally flushed Parvati nodded. “That’s right, it’s about the... Witches blessing.”“... More like curse.” he heard Lavender mutter under her breath.“I remember but I thought McGonagall said girls wouldn’t start feeling the effects until the end of the year?” he asked.“Most don’t, both me and Lavender are still able to... you know,” she replied. “But Hermione is the oldest in our year, and she’s under so much stress that I think it’s kicked in early for her.”“That makes sense I guess, but McGonagall said it was something witches handled between themselves, and we only needed to know in case one of them asked us to, erm, help them.”“That’s usually the case, we can’t exactly expect third year boys to help us without running their mouths to the entire school a day later.” Lavender replied bitterly.“But... You know what Hermione is like, she’s headstrong and independent,” said Parvati. “We also think she might be too caught up in muggle ideas of sex and relationships that she sees us helping her as being wrong.”“We both offered to help her when we noticed her... struggling,” began Lavender. “But she’d just get really embarrassed and pulled her curtains closed or run to the bathroom”“So what am I supposed to do?” asked Harry.“Do you mean physically?” replied Parvati with a smirk.“No!... I mean... If she says no to you why would she let me help?” He stammered.“Because you’re hot.”“And her best friend.”“And a boy.”“And she trusts you.”“... And you’re hot.” finished Lavender.Now red faced, Harry looked them in the eyes. “This isn’t some trick right?”Parvati gently sat down next to him. “No Harry, it’s not a trick we just really think you can help.”“Okay, but where would I even help her? I can’t exactly sneak her up to the boys dormitory.” he asked.“Yeah McGonagall frowns on that until fifth year.” muttered Lavender receiving an elbow from Parvati.“Wait, what?”“Never mind that Harry,” replied Parvati “You can just use the Witches Magic.”“Witches Magic?” he asked.“Oh, I guess McGonagall doesn’t cover that with you guys.” she replied, “Basically over time witches began passing down a set of spells designed to hide the secret from wizards.”“And wizards encouraged it because it let them help their wives and girlfriends without worrying about what other guys think.” cut in Lavender.“Over time that’s just how it was done, the wizards controlled the family, politics and finances...” began Parvati.“...and witches controlled the bedroom.” Lavender finished with a wink.“So you can make it so nobody finds out?” asked Harry.“Well no wizards, any witch will still see or hear everything but they won’t be able to tell anyone other than another witch.” replied Parvati.“See and hear?” he repeated.“Well there aren’t enough broom closets in the school for people to really have privacy around here so...” she looks to Lavender for support.“... So we mostly just use the corner of the common room and watch each others conquests.” Lavender finished with a grin.“Could you try to be less crass for once!” hissed Parvati.“What, he deserves to know that come next year half the Hogwarts population are gonna want to catch an eyeful.” she replied.“Look I don’t know if I’m ready for...“ Harry began to reply.“I’m sorry Harry, I wasn’t trying to scare you off or anything.” replied Lavender honestly.“What you don’t yet know Harry is how much respect the witches have for the wizards who follow the old ways.” said Parvati.“The old ways?” he asked.“Before the wars and You-know-who it was seen as the duty of a wizard,” began Lavender. “The witches would submit to their husbands running the family and the wizards would submit to their wives in return.”“These days it’s more common to see wizards expecting to be dominant for sex,” Parvati said in a sad tone. “There are many who won’t even touch that part of a witch out of some misguided sense of masculinity.”“But you don’t give us that vibe Harry.” cut in Lavender.“Which is why we think you’re just the pe
