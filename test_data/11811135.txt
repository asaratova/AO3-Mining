Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Dumbledore was a bit worried. Hagrid reported back from his visit with Harry. If he could have called it a visit. Vernon Dursley had shot Hagrid in the arm. Hagrid said he saw Harry curled up in a corner but that the Dursleys wouldn't let him near the boy. Their son was huge compared to Harry. Hagrid said Harry didn't even look like he was old enough to go to Hogwarts.Dumbledore was now waiting in his office for Severus Snape. If anyone could discover what was wrong with the boy, it would be Severus. Was it all a ploy by the Dursleys to keep Harry? He knew over the years that they had demanded more and more money to care for Harry. Maybe they were afraid of losing their source of money? He stopped his musing as Severus was announced.____________________________________________________________________________Severus Snape couldn't believe he was doing this. He was heading toward Petunia Dursley's house. How he hated the woman. Why Dumbledore left the Potter spawn there he would never understand. He found number 4 but he didn't feel any magic. He discreetly pulled out his wand and ran a scan. There weren't any wards on the house or even in the area.He put his wand away. He headed up the walkway of said house. He wondered if they used a ruler to measure the grass. Knowing Petunia she most like screamed every time the grass put a blade out of place. The whole area just screamed, "we want to make everyone believe we are normal". He was sickened by the whole neighborhood. He would also bet that at least three neighbors were spying on him as he approached the pristine house. He knocked on the door. He heard a child scream "Mum, there is a freak on at the door."Severus, if he was honest, wasn't a bit surprised by that. He would bet the contains of his vault that Petunia raised Potter and her son to be spoiled brats and taught them that the world revolved around them. He was going to have Dumbledore testing some potions for him."What do you want?" Petunia asked through clenched teeth. "We already told you the boy isn't going.""Hello to you too, Tunney. I am here to speak to Potter.""What didn't you freaks understand? We said no. He isn't going." She went to shut the door but he pushed against it."Do I need to remind you that I am over 17 and can perform magic outside of Hogwarts?" Severus sneered. "Now, I want to speak to Potter. I will leave after that.""Fine."Severus resisted the urge to wipe his face. He followed Petunia into the house. He looked around noticing the wall of pictures. He looked at them and not one of them had Potter. They either contained the fat blob he could see eating ice cream in front of the telly or a family of three. He could see out of the corner of his eye that Petunia walked to a door. Why was she opening a door to a boot cupboard? "Get out."Severus watched as a small child emerged. The boy looked to be about 7 or 8. He was so skinny, Severus wondered if he could count the boy's ribs. The clothes he had on were huge and Severus could see some bruises. He could see some blood that dried on the clothing and skin. He felt his stomach sink as he finally looked at the face. It was Harry Potter. The boy had blue spiked hair, Lily's green eyes. "Potter?""Freak, tell him you are staying here." Petunia's claws squeezing the boy's shoulders.Severus didn't even wait for a response. He stunned her. When she fell over he walked closer to the boy. He stopped moving when the boy started to retreat. "Harry, I promise you, I won't hurt you. I am here to remove you from here to someplace safe." Harry tilted his head and Severus felt something strange caress his skin. "I knew your parents. They would have never wanted you to remain here." He ignored the feeling. He recognized what it was. He had the same gift. It wasn't an uncommon gift but one that was usually found in magical children who were abused. Their magic developed a way to protect them. It would allow them to know who would hurt them or not. It didn't keep them safe from their abuser but it did keep them safe from others who might do the same thing.Harry slowly walked closer to Severus. He glanced at his fat cousin who still hadn't moved from in front of the telly. Severus didn't move as Harry touched the dark mark on his arm. "You help Harry?""Yes." Severus still hadn't moved. "I'm here to take you to Hogwarts. Once there, we will get you healed, some food, some clothes, and a real room for you."Harry glanced back at the still form of his Aunt. "She bad?""Yes.""Uncle too?""Yes."Harry walked back to the cupboard. Severus watched Harry pull out a ratty blanket and three toys. "Ready."Severus saw the blanket that had HJP on the corner. It was the baby blanket he had given Lily for Harry the day Harry had been born. He got up and peeked inside the cupboard. He was hoping to find more clothes or even something to suggest it wasn't as bad as he was thinking it was. He found an old baby mattress on the floor. The cupboard wa
