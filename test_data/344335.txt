Chapter 1





Chapter Text
Harry wasn’t exactly sure how it had started.  Well, scratch that, he knew how it had started, he just wasn’t sure why it had continued or what had possessed his classmates to allow it to continue.
Sixth year for Harry had started out slowly, and progressed even slower.  Everyone was nervous and tense due to the war that grew inevitably closer.  Voldemort hadn’t surfaced since the incident before summer holidays, not even within Harry’s dreams or through his scar.  And somewhat unexpectedly, none of the captured Death Eaters had escaped from Azkaban.
Harry himself had been understandably moody since returning to Hogwarts.  Sirius’ death had hit him hard, even if he’d only known him for a few years.  He’d been the closest parental figure Harry’d ever had.  The only other wizard he could put in that position would be Dumbledore, and the betrayed feeling he’d had after parting with him the year before hardly helped with Harry’s feelings of loss.
It had actually been Hermione’s idea to throw the combined House party.  After Gryffindor had beaten Ravenclaw in Quidditch, with Harry reappointed as Seeker, the party they’d had in Gryffindor had left everybody considerably relaxed and cheerful.  So Hermione reasoned that a big sixth year party would help everyone relax.
What had started out as an everyone’s-invited-but-really-only-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-and-Hufflepuff party was soon crashed by the Slytherins.  No one said anything outright, if only because it was supposed to be a combined House party, but the distaste was evident enough.
Malfoy, leading the rest of his House, only answered this with a smirk.

Draco had felt the effects of the events before summer as strongly as everyone else, if not more so.  His entire world had nearly been pulled from beneath his feet.  For the first time in his life the Malfoy name was openly scorned, and it was the longest amount of time he’d been away from his father while actually being home.  His feelings towards the whole Light and Dark issue hadn’t changed much.  He still despised muggle-borns, and he wasn’t about to welcome them with open arms, but at the same time he was currently harboring bitter animosities toward Voldemort with a passion only rivaled by his feelings for Potter, because the git hadn’t  done anything about his father being in prison.  Draco had expected a breakout attempt at the least two weeks into summer, and when it hadn’t come, nor showed any signs of coming, he’d been left shocked, hurt, and confused.
His mother wasn’t dealing with anything much better than Draco was.  While she was his mother, her maternal instinct left a lot to be desired, and it didn’t help that over the past five years Draco had been away from home more than he’d actually been at home.  Their relationship had become desperately bland, and Narcissa had spent most of her summer shut up in her bedroom, or out gallivanting between formal dinner parties and get togethers to try and dig the Malfoy name out of the sludge it had fallen into.
Despite his confusion, Draco actions regarding Potter and his two sidekicks hadn’t much changed.  Things had continued much the same way that they had the years before, if only growing more intense as the boys discovered how benefiting fist fighting could be.  Something about a bloodied face and having real evidence that they were physically destroying something just added fuel to the fire.
So when Draco got word of the combined House party, he wasn’t about to not attend.

Sometime after the Slytherins had arrived, bringing with them complaints about how boring the party was, things started to pick up a bit.
It was Pansy who suggested Spin the Bottle.  Apparently parties weren’t complete without a little action going on.
Which was how Harry found himself in his current position, several weeks later.
It had started out innocently enough.  Seamus had to kiss Susan Bones, Parvati kissed Blaise Zabini, Hermione kissed Terry Boot…  Then somewhere along the line, Lavender spun and the bottle landed on Padma…and everyone paused.
 “What happens now?” Lavender asked, glancing nervously at Padma out of the corner of her eye.
 “Kiss the boy nearest to her right,” Morag MacDougal offered.  Lavender nodded and was turning towards Dean when Pansy cut in.
 “No!  No, where’s the fun in that?” the black-haired girl said, lips curving into a smirk.  “The rules were that you had to kiss whomever the bottle landed on.  We didn’t say to do anything different when it happens to be a member of the same sex.”
Lavender blinked, her mouth forming a small ‘o’ as Padma’s cheeks colored slightly.  “A-alright, then,” she said softly, and crawled the remaining distance towards the other girl.
 “Well I have to admit, I thought there’d be a bit more protesting,” Pansy said, laughing shortly.  She arched a single eyebrow at the girl.
 “Well I’m a Gryffindor, aren’t I?” Lavender said airily.  “Known for being brave and all that.  Can’t refuse a
