Chapter Text

“
  
And what’s the difference between a butterfly and a moth, Miss Mione?” Mr. Granger asked his little girl. 

She looked up at him, bright and doe-eyed. Her curls got caught in the wind, untamed and wild as they always were. The butterfly in her father’s hand flapped precariously.

 “A butterfly,” she started, her voice high and filled with pure joy. “is prettier than a moth.” 

 Mr. Granger laughed heartily. “Many people would agree with you, I reckon. What if I told you I think the moth is prettier?” 

 Hermione placed her tiny, olive hand on her father’s, allowing the butterfly to climb onto her chubby finger. She lifted the sunset-coloured creature to her face. The spindly antennae tickled her nose and a giggle the sound of bells escaped her. 

“Moths are just grey and boring, daddy, you can’t like moths more.” Everything she said, she was sure of, from a very young age. Hermione was always very matter-of-fact, even when her parents disagreed with her. 

“Why not?” he challenged. “Do the moths deserve less love because they are not beautiful?”

She looked at the little bug as it flew away towards the endless blue sky. “No, that would be mean. But what if the butterfly is nicer than the moth, should we like it more then?”

Her father smiled. “Of course. It does not matter what the creature looks like if it is not kind. You could see the most wonderful thing in the world and it could have a black heart inside. But I ask you this, my dove, what if the moth were kinder than the butterfly? Do we grant it less love because of how it looks?”

Hermione shook her head and her mess of acorn brown hair bounced around her. “Never!”

“Never!” her father repeated jovially as he scooped her up in his arms. She giggled as he attacked her with tickles and kisses on her chubby cheeks. The little girl, after the events of a tickle fest, wrapped her arms around her father’s neck. He leaned his head in and brushed their noses together in an eskimo kiss. Hermione moved her head quickly, always trying to maximize the amount of nose kisses from her father.

“Thomas! Hermione! Lunchtime!” Mrs. Granger’s clear voice rang out.

“Race me, daddy!” the little one exclaimed.

Mr. Granger put her on the ground again and took his running stance. He looked at Hermione, who was in a little squat with her arms squared, honey brown eyes intensely determined to win. A flicker of pure love and adoration crossed his eye as he looked her tangled curls and fighting spirit.

“Go!”

Hermione ran in a waddle, her toddler legs only carrying her so quickly. Mr. Granger ran slow on purpose, as always.

“C’mon, Miss Mione!” Her mother stood at the back entrance of the garden with her arms held out. Her own curly brown hair and olive skin shimmered in the mid-afternoon sun as she smiled at her daughter.

Hermione jumped into her mother’s arms and her cheeks were pressed with kisses filled with the most love a parent could muster. She giggled and she smiled and her world was wonderfully perfect. She had mummy and daddy and she had her little back garden were her imagination roamed free.
Years later, Hermione would look back on her memories. She would see the tall tree she fell out of when she was five, never again daring to climb it. She would spot the wooden bench under said tree that she would spend countless hours reading under; from Jane Austen at the mere age of eight to the History of Magic when she was fourteen. Hermione was at peace in her little garden as the sun would beat down on her and her parents would beg her to come inside and put down a book for once.And yet, at four or fourteen, she hadn’t known that she would have her last moment of peace in that back garden at seventeen years old. During the Christmas holiday of her sixth year, where the snow met her ankles and the biting cold she was never fond of met her for her last moment of utter stillness; where nothing else in the world mattered but the blue sky and the birds, she had had her last moment of joy.Hermione had lost her peace....It was dawn, just before dawn, where the coral hues of early morning met the utter blackness that was night. It was always cold this early in the day but that was partly why Hermione stayed up. The cold was a feeling, it was tangible and indisputable. She needed the cold to tell her that she was still feeling, if nothing else.The Burrow became especially chilly, being amongst a forest, the air became a bit crisper and creatures would roam more frequently. Sat on a log with her knit sweater pulled tightly around her, she watched as dawn turned to early morning. Then a little moth fluttered around her before landing on her hand. She looked down at the small insect with its grey pattering and little
