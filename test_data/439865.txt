AN: I started writing/posting this story back in 2011.  For anyone who followed it back when I was posting consistently, you probably know that it sat utterly stagnant for about 2 whole years before I updated again.  Life has a way of getting in the way, but I've recently managed to slow things down a bit and I've picked writing back up.  I'm kind of bouncing around between different stories, but I intend to keep bouncing back to this one, so hopefully it'll keep getting updates.  They'll just be slow.– – –

November 1981

He didn't understand how it had happened, but Albus Dumbledore was in a panic.  He had left the young Harry Potter on the Dursley's doorstep with a nice warming charm and under a heavy sleeping spell, so it simply didn't make sense that he could have up and wandered off, but the Dursley's insisted they'd never seen the boy.  They found the basket and the letter, but no baby, and no blanket.

They'd thought the whole thing some sort of sick joke, and were none-too-pleased when Albus Dumbledore had come to their doorstep some week later when his little spindly devices told him that the wards he had erected had not took.  

His worst fear was that little Harry Potter had been taken, and as tracking spell after tracking spell failed, his fears grew and grew.  He had to be behind wards of some sort for such a thing to be possible, which meant he was with a witch or wizard.  The only consolation he had was that his instruments still told him that young Harry Potter was alive.

January 1982

He had just received word from the goblins of Gringotts; Harry Potter's vault had been accessed.  He had rushed to the bank to ask his questions, but the results were frustratingly limited.  The only way a person could gain access to the vault without the key was to provide a sample of blood that matched their magical records for Potter blood.  And somehow, the person who had entered the bank, had done just that.  But the person that the goblins said had entered the bank had been an adult – or at least, he had appeared to be an adult.  The goblins refused to give him a memory of what the man looked like.  They did say that the next time he came in, they would do one of their standard security checks on the man, but that was all.  He wanted them to notify him immediately if the man came in, but they refused.

It was outrageously frustrating.

October 1984

The man had come and gone a few more times at the bank, and that was the only clue that Albus Dumbledore had towards Harry Potter's continued existence.  His instruments still said the child was alive, but his tracking and scrying spells continued to turn up nothing.  The goblins had informed him that the man who was coming into their bank and occasionally withdrawing money from the Potter vaults was probably under Polyjuice, or possibly using glamours.  Every time he came, he looked a little different, but every time he passed the blood test and was able to enter the vault.  

He didn't come very often; no more than twice a year, and generally he made vaguely sizable withdrawals – although not all that large with the total vault size taken into account.  Just enough for a person to live in relative comfort without having to work.  It would probably be a modest amount for a single person to live off of.  Another curious thing was that the person in question always had the goblins convert the majority of the money withdrawn, into muggle money.

It was very little to go off of, and he knew his worry and frustration was obvious to others.  Minerva still hadn't forgiven him for losing Harry Potter in the first place, and still often ragged on him needing to come clean with the Ministry so they could properly enlist their assistance in the search.  

He was not willing to do that, however.  Minister Bagnold wasn't exactly a bad leader, but she didn't
