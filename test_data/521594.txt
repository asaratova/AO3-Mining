Chapter 1: The Enchanted Snitches
    




Chapter Text
The young witch slowly closed the leather-bound book, smiling as she mused over the author’s theories on the infamous disappearance of the Dark Wizard Dorian Hatchley. Hermione had picked up the biography of the famed sorcerer when she wandered into the library after breakfast, and had been immediately absorbed in the topic and Mildred Flutterwit’s scintillating prose.As she got to her feet and stretched, Hermione realized with surprise that she hadn’t been interrupted even once. After a few weeks living in a house full of wizards, she was used to their constant interruptions to her time in the library, like Sirius dropping by to ask her opinion on his latest house-remodeling idea, or the twins requesting her help with a prank (occasionally she gave them some advice) - or pleading with her to be a test subject (to which she always responded with a firm no, thank you very much). Remus was the kindest, often stepping in to offer her tea around three, but Harry’s visits were her favorite by far, as he always distracted her from her studies in entertaining ways that never made her feel like he thought less of her for spending so much time with her books.Hermione entered the maze of bookshelves, soon found the section for the 14th and 15th century biographies, and put  Dorian the Dastardly  gently back in its place. She left the library, glancing back at the large room fondly. The seventeen-year-old had been in many grand libraries, and while Grimmauld Place did not have as many volumes as the Cardiff Wizarding Library, or even the Hogwarts library, it  did  boast an astonishing collection of spellbooks filled with illicit and even illegal content (of course, she only read them for the knowledge, and would never practice such things), and best of all, many fascinating biographies of dark wizards and witches. It was her third summer at Grimmauld Place, and this time, she really could peruse its library to her heart’s content. Since the Order had finally defeated Riddle for good, she no longer had to focus on finding defensive spells, and could instead explore what she was interested in.As she began to descend the staircase, the old steps creaked ominously beneath her, and Hermione made a mental note to remind Sirius to deal with that. He’d decided to keep Grimmauld Place after the war was done and it no longer needed to be used as Order Headquarters. With Remus’ help, Sirius was fixing his family’s ancestral home one mess at a time. He particulary enjoyed horrifying the portraits of his pureblood ancestors by painting the walls with cheerful murals, hanging up his favorite cinema posters all over the house.She arrived at last in the dining room, sighed as she saw some dishes that had been left haphazardly on the table, and pulled out her wand. With a little concentration and a swish and a flick, Hermione levitated the plates, magically stacking them, one upon the other.  She marched to the kitchen, the plates floating before her, and lowered the dirty dishes into the sink with a graceful dip of her wand tip, then smiled with satisfaction as she tucked the vinewood wand back into her holster. It always felt good using magic, even for the simplest little things.At the loud sound of the plates entering the sink, Fred and George looked up from a box they were bent over, and hastily moved to stand in front of it.“You didn’t have to do that, Hermione,” George protested.“It’s no trouble,” she shrugged. “I leave mine out sometimes too. Just take care of the washing, will you?”“Yes, right away, Miss Head Girl,” Fred said with a crisp salute.Hermione blushed and laughed softly. “It hasn’t been confirmed yet!”“Please, like McGonagall would give it to anyone else,” George grinned as he headed to the sink and grabbed a sponge. “You’ll get it for certain.”She eyed the twins curiously as Fred followed his twin to the sink and grabbed a dishtowel.“I remember how you had it in for Percy when he became Head Boy. How come you’re not making fun of me for wanting it?”“Well, you’re not a stuck-up prat,” George explained humorously as he began to scrub the dishes.“He’s gotten much better,” Hermione felt the need to defend their brother, who had come to his senses during the last year of the war, and become a spy for the Order from inside the Ministry. Percy had given them valuable information that had led to them retaking the Ministry from the Death Eaters.“He’s not a bad guy,” George allowed. “But he is utterly incapable of letting his hair down.”“Unlike you,” Fred turned and winked at her.Hermione felt herself flushing, her hand coming up automatically to feel the fringes of her long, untamable hair which hung loose about her shoulders.George began to whistle, and Fred soon joined in on counterpoint. It sounded vaguely familiar, something she ought to know, but her eyes caught on the box they’d left on the counter, and she was immediately distracted.What could be in there? Hermio
