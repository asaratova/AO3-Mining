Chapter Text
1—Audience“Private Eyes. They're watching you. They see your every move.”—Hall & Oates(Hermione)A blissful smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. Yes! More! Her hand skimmed down the leather, her thighs tightening in anticipation. Her hips circled once. Twice. Her clit screamed for a touch. She closed her eyes, her head falling back as she inhaled deeply. Oh gods. Smell that? Could any scent be more mouthwatering? The most primal areas of her brain lit up like a finale of fireworks, and her juices started to flow. Now.Hermione opened her eyes and leveled her gaze. Mine. Spreading her arms like the Winged Victory of Samothrace, she strutted between the shelves, touching every spine as she passed. Yeeeeeeees! The dusty scent of decaying parchment tickled her nose. The perfume of periodicals. That smell could bring a girl to her knees.This was a library fit for a queen. And since there were no other females in sight, she deduced that this was her kingdom, the leather and canvas covers hers to rule. She could open any of them and command their knowledge. Her loyal subjects cheered her reign and begged for an audience with their majesty.Unfortunately, a fine layer of dust covered most of the silent throng, leaving them all dulled in a ghostly haze of grey. She brushed off her fingers and caressed one aged spine whose lettering had worn away. The Malfoys really should take better care of their books. It would be a shame if something happened to all these rare titles.Draco's library was the main reason she agreed to come to his parties. When he'd started working at the Ministry five years earlier, she had expected him to pick up where he'd left off as the Prat Prince of Slytherin. But the war had done more than smear his family name through the mud; it had sucked away his snark. He'd been nothing but polite and courteous when they shared the lift or passed in the corridors, but she'd assumed he was just putting on a good show for anyone who might be watching. Then one day at lunch in the canteen, he had asked to sit with her, and she'd almost fallen out of her hard plastic chair in shock.Draco 2.0 Turned out to be a worthy companion. They'd been awkward and stiff with each other at first, but they eventually fell into a comfortable rhythm. She never thought she'd see the day when she'd be joking with Draco Malfoy over shepherd’s pie and apple crumble, but time had a way of making fools of even the most stubborn witches.He was still arrogant and sarcastic, he just didn't aim his aspersions in her direction. Hermione found his intelligence appealing, and he was a consummate conversationalist, a trait her brain appreciated. And she soon discovered that talking wasn't Draco's only perk. That boy had the inside scoop on the entire Ministry. She worked in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, while Draco was in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. He was privy to information that never made its way to her desk, and it didn't hurt that he chatted up every witch in the building. As soon as he turned on the charm, they were all dying to spill their secrets. He was like a one man MI5.That came in handy when her lowly division, Creature Justice, needed more money. It was just her and two subordinates—not high on the funding totem pole. But with Draco's inside information, she'd gotten two financial windfalls. He'd done more for Creature Justice than anybody would ever know—including him.Then, two years into their budding friendship, Draco's remaining swagger had taken an even bigger blow when Narcissa contracted a particularly virulent strain of dragon pox. The virus quickly ravaged her beauty with its harsh scarring and discoloration, and after being admitted to St. Mungo’s for intensive care, she’d passed away in the early hours of the morning with scarcely any warning at all.Draco and Lucius were devastated by the loss, and although Draco came back to work, he’d changed. He seemed quieter, and Hermione found him much more thoughtful during their lunchtime chats. They occasionally went out for drinks after work, but Hermione didn't really like to drink, so she just sat with him while he got pissed on Firewhisky. He wasn't a mean drinker, so she didn't mind.Mostly he was a dance-y drinker. He'd down a few shots then find some willing witch to fling around the floor. Hermione couldn't help noticing most of them were blonde. If he didn't go home with one of his dance partners, he came over to her flat and crashed on her couch.She would find him there in the morning, huddled in a ball under her Aunt Geraldine’s green afghan, his eyes red and swollen from crying. He always said it was from the drinking, but she knew better.Sad Draco was a much more sensitive Draco. At least with her he was. She had no idea how he treated his sexual conquests. Maybe he was still humping
