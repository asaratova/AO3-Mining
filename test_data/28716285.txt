Chapter 1: I: Betrayal
    




Chapter Text
Anger. Fear. Sadness. Disappointment. A storm of emotions. That was the only way to describe what Harry was feeling right now as he sat silently looking over the Black Lake. It was a cold but sunny Saturday and one week had passed since his name had come out of the Goblin of Fire, forcing him into a deadly competition against his will. To make matters worse, the whole school had then quickly turned against him, and even his two best friends -- his only two friends, really -- had abandoned him.Harry thought back at their reactions when his name had come out of the Goblet and Dumbledore had called out his name in the Great Hall. The look of shock on Ron's face had quickly changed into something more akin to anger, and Hermione had looked at him with a mixture of suspicion and disappointment.He should have known from the look on Ron's face that the redhead would be quick to jump at his throat. Calling him a liar, not believing him when he said he didn't put his name in the cup. Thinking back, it was as if he could see his friendship with Ron evaporate before his eyes in that very moment.Hermione was the bigger surprise, and for some reason he couldn't understand himself, her betrayal hurt infinitely more. Perhaps she didn't believe him either. Or perhaps she didn't want to get in the middle of the feud between him and the entire rest of the school. The fact of the matter was that his two 'best' friends had both turned their backs on him. Hermione hadn't spoken to him since that evening. Neither had Ron, except for some muttered insults and snide remarks.Ron was just following the trend with that. Everywhere Harry went, his fellow students glared at him, called him a cheat and an arrogant jerk, or wished him a painful death in the first task.He gave out a bitter laugh and broke his gaze from the water.He had saved the school twice; from Quirrellmort in his first year and from the Basilisk a year later. But the moment his name had flown out of that stupid cup, all that was instantly forgotten. He was once again the pariah of the school.Harry grabbed a nearby rock and tossed it violently into the lake.It was his second year all over again, when the whole school had shunned him, convinced that he was the heir of Slytherin and had opened the Chamber of Secrets. The only difference was that in his second year, at least his friends had stayed by his side. Angrily, he grabbed another stone and ran his thumb over the edge.In order to avoid everyone, Harry had fled to a secluded spot at the shore of the Black Lake. That was where he currently sat, throwing stones, with his emotions in turmoil. His thoughts concerning the approaching first task randomly fluctuated between mortal fear and fatalistic stoicism.How was he supposed to prepare for a task when he had no idea what was coming? He sat in silence as he brainstormed various ideas of tasks that could be thrown his way during the tournament. He knew that guessing wouldn't help him much. With no clues to guide him, one guess was just as good as any other. For all he knew, he could be up against Chimeras, Gorgons, Werewolves, Dragons, Minotaurs, Giants, Vampires, or anything else. He had no idea what he would be facing.Harry sighed and decided that he couldn't hide forever. He admitted to himself that he needed help and thought about whom to approach for it. Hermione would be the best choice, obviously, if she would only listen to him.Then an idea struck him. Dumbledore had believed him when he told him that he hadn't entered his name into the goblet. He would simply ask Dumbledore to announce that fact in front of the school! Then, people would finally believe him, and Hermione would be back at his side. It was such an obvious solution to end the bullying that he wondered not only why he hadn't thought of it earlier, but also why the headmaster hadn't done it on his own accord.Content to have a plan for the first time since Halloween, Harry got up and walked slowly back up towards the castle.~~~Harry entered the Great Hall just before dinner started. He sat alone at the Gryffindor table, as it had become his habit during the last week. Trying to ignore the hateful glares directed at him from students at all tables, he looked down the table and spotted his two former best friends. Ron was sneering at him with his best Draco Malfoy impression, and Hermione looked at him with a weird expression. Harry caught her eyes and forced a small smile on his face, but she shook her head and turned away from him, scowling.Harry sighed but he was hopeful that this whole misunderstanding would soon be resolved with the help of the headmaster.Towards the end of the meal, Harry stood up and approached the teachers' table. The hall immediately grew quiet and Harry could feel every eye on him."Headmaster Dumbledore?" he asked cautiously."Harry, my boy, what can I do today for our youngest champion?" Dumbledore asked him with a warm grandfatherly
