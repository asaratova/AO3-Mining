Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole
    




Chapter Text
It was a sunny morning in early May. The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall showed a clear blue sky strewn with wisps of high clouds. It would be perfect weather for flying, had half of the Gryffindor Quidditch team not been summarily banned from the sport by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.
Harry was sat at the Gryffindor table on the same bench as Ron. Across from them, Hermione was almost entirely hidden by a stack of textbooks that must have been at least a dozen volumes high. Up and down the table, and indeed, throughout the Great Hall, there were other students reading during dinner. O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s were coming up, and the general atmosphere among the fifth and seventh years was that of restrained panic. Few of the revising students, however, boasted such an eclectic combination of books as Hermione Granger. Her stack included titles such as Myths and Legends of Ancient Wizarding Britain, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and, of course, Hogwarts: A History.
Harry looked up from his plate when Hermione snapped shut her current book, The Almanac of the Arachnid, and threw it on top of the pile with a scowl.
“I just don’t see how it could be an Acromantula!” she huffed, tucking her frizzy hair behind her ear. “There’s nothing here that remotely links any kind of Acromantula to petrification: they incapacitate their victims with their venom and their webs!”
“It was an Acromantula enchanted by Slytherin himself though, wasn’t it,” Ron mumbled through a mouthful of mashed potato. He withered under Hermione’s glare, swallowed and quickly said; “That’s what Ernie Macmillan told me, anyway.”
“You don’t honestly believe that Hagrid was responsible!”
“You know I don’t! And anyway, no one could believe that, not after it got Eric Burns last night. How’s Hagrid supposed to have done that when he’s in Azkaban? I bet she’s shitting bricks.”
There was no doubt who was meant by "she". They all turned to look up at the top table. Umbridge was perching on the edge of Dumbledore’s chair in the centre. While all the teachers were in attendance (minus Hagrid and Trelawney), the chairs immediately to each side of her were pointedly unoccupied. The Headmistress herself had a furtive, nervous disposition. Her bulbous, protruding eyes frequently flicked up from the many letters and scrolls spread out on her table to survey the many whispering students in the Great Hall.
The sight made Harry grin - just a few weeks before, she had sat on that chair like it was a throne, smirking down at them all through breakfast, lunch and dinner.
“They have to let him out now,” Hermione said hopefully. “I was expecting to see it announced in the Prophet this morning . . .”
There was a long, uncomfortable pause as they all contemplated Hermione’s statement. Harry stabbed a carrot on his plate moodily. He was deeply worried about how his half-giant friend was doing, trapped in a too-small cell in Azkaban. Would the Dementors that guarded the prison have the same effect on him that they did on other wizards?
“I still say it’s Fred and George,” Ron said, finally. “This melodramatic ‘Heir of Slytherin’ stuff is right up their street - and the writing on the wall? Classic! When we were kids, they used to write ‘Poo’ everywhere in Impervious Ink, and then sign it ‘Ron’ to get me in trouble. ‘Course, it didn’t work, because I couldn’t write my own name at that age --“
“Surely you can’t still think that Ron,” Hermione admonished. “Not after Hagrid.”
"Why not? They didn't know that Hagrid had got in trouble for it fifty years ago - they probably just heard about it from a ghost or a book and thought it was a cool prank."
"A student died last time!"
"They probably didn't hear that part." Ron paused to think, and then raised a finger. "And they've kept the attacks going, see, to clear Hagrid's name. Bet you anything they stop when he gets out."
“Petrification isn’t like Stunning someone - it’s serious magic! It'll take months for Professor Sprout to finish the Mandrake Draught. Daphne Greengrass and Simon Wright are going to miss their exams!" Hermione was aghast at the very idea.
"I wish I could miss mine. Do you think if I asked nicely, they'd do me too?"
"That’s not funny!" Hermione slapped her hand down on the table, rattling the cutlery. But Harry was laughing. He loved watching his two best friends bicker - it distracted him from all the horrible things that had happened that year; Umbridge, the loss of his Firebolt, the discovery of the DA and the fact that it was his fault that Professor Dumbledore had been forced to flee the school . . .
"The pattern of victims doesn't make sense for Fred and George anyway." Hermione mused as Harry and Ron's laughter died down. "Daphne Greengrass, attacked the week after Dumbledore left - she's a Slytherin" she said, ticking them off on her fingers. "Then little Olivia Daniels from Gryffindor in the last week of April, then Simon Wright, seventh ye
