Chapter 1: Harry Is Rubbish At Blending In
    




Chapter Text
Tom Riddle had barely taken his first bite of roasted venison before he was interrupted.“Uh, Tom? Mr Riddle, sir?”Olive Hornby, a third year Ravenclaw, hovered anxiously at his shoulder. She was a vapid, silly girl with plain features, a head of curly hair, and an excruciating habit of giggling after every sentence.“Yes, Hornby?” Tom’s smile slid over his features like ice, freezing the muscles into a charming still.Hornby tittered. It sounded potentially infectious. “Professor Dumbledore asked if he could see you in his office. He, um, said it was urgent.”“Did he specify why?”“No. Sorry, Tom. I could, uh, ask if you want?” She rocked on her heels, eager to please.“That’s quite alright, Hornby. I’m sure I’ll find out soon enough,” Tom assured her, not wanted to prolong the interaction.“Oh, of course.” Hornby hesitated and sunk into a jerky sort of curtsy.Atticus Avery snorted unpleasantly.Hornby opened her mouth like she wanted to say something more, but turned bright red and closed it again. She let out a strangled squeak.“You can leave now, Hornby,” Tom said.Hornby nodded and turned to leave, shuffling back towards the Ravenclaw table. Her walk grew more and more confident with every step she got further away until, finally, she was greeted enthusiastically: the leader amongst her gaggle of Ravenclaw sycophants.“Mudblood,” Montgomery Lestrange muttered, running his teeth over his tongue to remove a foul taste.“Her mother is actually a leading Unspeakable,” Cassius Rosier said softly, eyes never leaving the page in front of him.Well, Tom supposed it took all sorts. "I'm sure she's very proud," he said diplomatically.“Father’s worked with Unspeakable Hornby on something before, I think,” Orion Black piped up, wiping his mouth with a napkin. “The Veil of Death, I believe.”“Of Death?” Tom asked.“I wonder what it does,” Rupert Dolohov sniggered.“Continue?” Tom prompted, attention caught. He didn’t lean forward in his seat - he did have restraint - but he might have, had he been anyone else.“Oh. Yes,” Orion said hesitantly. “I don’t think they know much about it yet, but apparently you can hear loved ones whispering if you get too close to it. Only if they’re dead, of course, but Father said it’s almost like they’re standing at your shoulder.”“Didn’t one of the Unspeakables kill themselves over it last year?” Atticus said thoughtfully. “A recent widow, or something?”"Swapped one black veil for another." Rupert grinned at them all, evidently proud of his little quip.Tom felt a surge of disgust at the idea of killing yourself over love. Pathetic. His interest was caught, though, by the idea of a door between the living and the dead – perhaps this was something he could explore in a future venture.“Do they know how it works?”Orion perked up at Tom’s interest. “Oh, no. Father didn’t say. But, apparently it’s like nothing they’ve ever seen before. Made from the same stuff as Dementor cloaks, they reckon.”Dementors – now there was something Tom had never considered. Soul magic-- that was deep magic, the kind that no one had touched in decades. Not yet, anyway.“Tommy, don’t you have to go see Dumbledore?”The slimy voice of Caspar Grahams found little welcome with Tom. Grahams was a fellow Slytherin sixth year, but certainly not one of Tom’s closest. He was weak and needy – two things Tom had never been able to abide. He had little to offer appearance-wise, and his magic was, at best, average. Tom kept him at arms-length. And then there was that word.“Tommy?” His voice was glacial and accompanied by a scalding glare. Tom wouldn’t have been surprised if Grahams melted into his seat.“S-sorry, Tom,” Grahams muttered, his skin whitening with terror. Perhaps he was recalling the incident last year, where he ‘accidentally’ fell into a cauldron containing an overpowered Draught of Living Death and remained in a coma until Christmas. Coincidentally, he had been working with Tom.The rest of the group ignored the casual threat with practised ease.“What did you think the old goat-fucker wants now?” Rupert snickered, elbowing Atticus's side.“No, Rupert," Atticus said slowly, an unpleasant smile pulling at his lips, "the goat-fucker’s his brother."Rupert dissolved into hysterics and Tom rolled his eyes at the vulgarity, standing abruptly. The pair froze.“I should go and visit our Deputy Headmaster. I will be back shortly. Save my plate.”And so he bid a swift, perfunctory farewell to his companions and made his way up to Dumbledore’s office.The Transfigurations classroom had always been Tom’s least favourite space, filled with Dumbledore’s odds and ends as it was. The pokey office hidden through a door at the back was even worse. Cluttered, colourful and disorganised – it was everything Tom hated. Dumbledore, predictably, seemed to thrive in it.The Deputy Headmaster sat contentedly in his chair: an elaborate, wooden thing painted in bright shimmering colours, apparently
