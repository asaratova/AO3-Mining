Chapter Text

 “All human wisdom is contained in these two words— ”Wait and Hope.”  
― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo—January Bright lights and lime green.Hermione grappled with those fleeting observations as she struggled towards consciousness. Her head alternated between mind-shattering throbs and stabs of shooting pain so intense she saw lights behind her eyelids.She could hardly consider her circumstances with such brain-melting pain poking and prodding at her gray matter. A flash of lime green and something vile slid down her throat. Sweet relief; the pain ebbed. A soft voice. “Jenkins, lower the lights again, we’re close.”The bright lights barely dimmed.“Hermione, if you can hear me, you’re exiting a magically induced coma. You’ve been in an accident but you are very safe and in a controlled environment, try to remain calm as you come out of it.”Hermione decided that she liked the sound of the soft voice: velvet against her eardrums. But she liked what the voice said much less.Magically induced coma? Accident? Did that mean she was at St. Mungo’s? Of course: lime green robes. The color palette made sense.She tried to force her eyes open again; they fluttered under the attacking lights. She squeezed them shut, sucked in a breath, and opened them again. A world of color and light and blur greeted her.A figure stood nearby. She couldn’t make out any details, except that they were person-shaped and dressed in lime green robes. Almost certainly St. Mungo’s, then.“My name is Healer Lucas,” the figure above her said. Hermione was struck by how odd it was not to see someone’s lips when they spoke. She blinked rapidly, trying to erase the cloudy filter from her eyes. “I’m here with my apprentice, Healer Jenkins. We’re the healers assigned to your case.”Hermione tried to swallow. Her throat caught part way through the motion, her only relief from the painful dryness being the potion they’d dose her with.Catching the motion, Healer Lucas offered her water.Hermione had never tasted something so refreshing in her life.“Hermione, we need to perform some initial diagnostics now that you’re conscious,” Healer Lucas pressed gently. “If at any point you need a break or feel too unwell to continue, just let me know.”Hermione didn’t trust her own voice just yet, so she nodded. Healer Lucas procured a parchment out of nowhere. “Do you know your full name?”Oh, gods. How bad was it that they needed to ask her her own name?“Hermione.” She gave a small cough and tried again. “Hermione Jean Granger.”Healer Lucas made a note.“And what year is it?”Hermione felt an unfamiliar rush of hot panic fluttering inside her. She normally had control over her nerves; she didn’t rattle easily. She was a tried and true Gryffindor to her core. But she felt something dreadful lingering.“It’s 2001.”Healer Lucas made another note.“And who is Minister for Magic?”“Kingsley Shacklebolt.”Another note. Hermione couldn’t take it anymore.“What happened to me?” she asked, her voice cracking. “How bad was it? Why do you need to ask such basic questions?” The fluttering of anxiety swelled from her stomach to her chest. Her throat tightened. Her insides roiled.Quite patiently, Healer Lucas set her parchment aside. “These diagnostic questions are essential for establishing a baseline.”“A baseline for what?” Hermione asked, her voice breaking into something shrill. Her heart hammered behind her ribs. “A first year could answer those questions correctly. Let’s skip to the relevant information and tell me what’s going on.”Her demand probably sounded petulant, but Hermione felt like her chest might crack open from the panic.Healer Lucas took a deep breath. Inhaled through her nose. Exhaled through her mouth.“You need to breathe,” she said. Hermione tried, truly she did. “And while a first year may be able to answer those questions correctly, you did not.”Hermione sputtered her exhale.“What?”“You did not answer them correctly.”The anxiety vanished, leaving in its place something cold and vacant. Terror. “Which one.”“Two of the three, my dear. But we’re prepared for this-”“What do you mean two of the three? Which two?” Hermione didn’t even recognize her own voice, so cold, so low, so unlike her own cadence. “I know my own name,” she insisted.“Let’s circle back to that,” Healer Lucas said. “You’ve had a very traumatic brain injury, and memory loss is a potential side effect we’ve been preparing for.”“Memory loss?” The words felt leaden on Hermione’s tongue.“We hope only temporary. The magical mind is a powerful and adaptive thing, but it can also be unpredictable. Jenkins is already working on your treatment plan.” Jenkins waved tentatively to her from his place near the door.“Let’s start with what you got right. Kingsley Shacklebolt is indeed the Minister for Magic,” healer Lucas started, her voice ever-so-gentle. “However, it isn’t the y
