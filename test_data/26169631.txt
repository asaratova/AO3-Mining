Chapter 1: The Rebound
    




Chapter Text

“It is time I take a more proactive role in your training, Harry,” Dumbledore said. The Headmaster had only been gone for a short time, but he looked like he’d aged decades in the time between Lucius Malfoy and the Hogwarts board of governors forcing him out and Harry finding the Chamber of Secrets and saving Ginny Weasley.

“You’re going to train me, sir?” Despite his exhaustion, Harry couldn’t contain his excitement. Dumbledore was the most formidable wizard alive, and personal training from him was an offer most would kill for.

“Indeed I am, Harry,” the old man said. “Students nearly died on my watch, and at least one would have if not for you. I must face the unfortunate reality that I cannot always be here to protect them, and you. You bear great responsibility on your shoulders, Harry, and I must do all I can to help you prepare to bear it.”

Over Two Years Later
Harry made his late night prefect rounds with a scowl on his face. What had started as such a great day had ended on a very sour note for him.After he pulled her sister Gabrielle out of the lake during the Triwizard tournament, Fleur Delacour had repaid Harry by teaching him all about how to please a woman. She’d given him the best first time anyone could ever ask for, and had continued to teach him throughout the year. He’d worried that their liaison would end when the year did, but they’d maintained a friends with benefits relationship throughout the summer, and she’d also been able to meet him in Hogsmeade sporadically now that he was back in school. He hadn’t been able to get enough of Fleur, and midway through today’s meeting he’d told her he wanted to go beyond the purely physical and make her his girlfriend. While they’d agreed at the very start that this was only going to be physical, he hadn’t been able to help himself from falling for her and wanting more. He’d thought he saw signs that she was growing fond of him as well, and that she might be receptive to the idea of being more than just his hands-on sexual tutor and friend with benefits. But today he found out that he’d evidently been very, very mistaken.She’d smiled at him sadly and let him down as gently as she could, saying that they should just continue as they were and he would understand some day that this was for the best, that there was someone else out there who was better for him and some day he would thank her for not monopolizing him and keeping him for herself before he could get to know this supposed special someone. Her words had been meant to spare him any pain, but he’d felt the rejection all the same. He’d been planning to stay for several hours more, but he hadn’t been able to bear being around her in that awkward situation and had returned to the castle early.Harry would have preferred to go back to his room and sulk, or perhaps go work out his frustration through some physical training. But tonight was his night to go on patrol, and he knew Hermione, McGonagall and Dumbledore would have all been disappointed in him if he’d skived off on his duty. (Sirius would probably try to scold him, knowing he was supposed to do so, but he’d never been big on rules himself so Harry doubted he’d have been able to put any heat behind it.) With any luck this would be a normal patrol where nothing out of the ordinary happened.He hadn’t seen anything notable with his own eyes, but then he made the mistake of pulling the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket and scanning for anything interesting. There were a number of students all huddled together in the charms classroom; ten of them, by his count. All of the names he recognized were Slytherin, with Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson chief among them. If it had been just the two of them he might have left it alone; his power to punish fellow prefects was limited, and the possibility of seeing Malfoy’s willy was horrifying to think about. Granted, Parkinson was sexy. She was also a massive bitch, but seeing her naked wouldn’t be an imposition by any means. It might even have been pleasant, were the odds of Malfoy also being naked not so high. Pansy was hot, but not so hot that it was worth seeing far more of Draco than he ever needed to see.  This didn’t appear to be some kind of after curfew sexcapade though, unless Malfoy and Parkinson enjoyed performing in front of a crowd. A group of Slytherins huddled together in a classroom hours after curfew was something no prefect who took their responsibility even semi-seriously could have overlooked. There was only one Slytherin that Harry actually got along with, but Daphne Greengrass was not one of the dots he could see in that classroom.His, well, he wouldn’t call it a friendship necessarily, at least not yet, but his association with Daphne was still a relatively new thing. Snape, for reasons known only to him, had paired the two of them up in potions at the beginning of the year. It had been difficult at first, neither of them trusting th
