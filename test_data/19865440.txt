JK Rowling and whatever other appropriate affiliates obviously own the rights to Harry Potter and the Harry Potter universe. I own nothing but the inserted original characters/plot concepts. I make no money on this. This is simply a FAN based work.I would like to give a huge shoutout to the wonderful humans that agreed to help me comb through past chapters to catch all the pesky lingering errors that I can no longer see. Thank you: Amelia_Davies_Writes, GalaxyNightangale, and all the others who have pointed out my grammatical errors via discord.And a massive thank you to Greca for agreeing to read and beta new chapters, to Ginny for acting as a sounding block for my ideas as I work to complete this beast, and to Invi who has prevented me from deleting this story several times now. Your help is greatly appreciated.

Please read the tags. 
This fic involves mature content, explicit language, dark themes, dark magic, difficult topics, violence, torture, blood, descriptions of injuries and the long-term consequences, mercy killings, heroic sacrificial tendencies, LGBTQ and coming out anxiety, character deaths, and all the other difficult things that come with a story about war. Everyone has different tolerances, so while I like to think that the darker aspects of this story are not gratuitous or overdone – and that this story has plenty of happy, cathartic, and humourous moments – I do not want to accidentally trigger anyone without sufficient warning. So please consider this as your warning. This fic has a level of gritty war brutality that some may not be comfortable with. This fic does not involve bashing, instead it takes a realistic look at the war, the consequences of actions, and grey morality of people faced with difficult situations. It is intended to be written for adults with an R rating, as per the assigned fic rating.Please be kind to everyone on this platform and remember that there are an infinite number of ways to tell a story. Hateful, rude, and inappropriate comments will be deleted.*********************************************************

 ‘So why are you still here?’ Harry asked Ron. 

 ‘Search me,’ said Ron. 

 ‘Go home then,’ said Harry. 

 ‘Yeah, maybe I will!’ shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away. 
Hermione tensed as the scene started to unfold in front of her. What was happening? For being ‘the brightest witch of her age’, it was as if her brain suddenly short-circuited and stopped functioning. After everything they had been through, the fights they had endured previously – Ron and Harry’s pissing fit in fourth year – she could feel the tension. She could visibly see the flames enlarging towards an inevitable explosion. The building pressure was familiar, like their fights before – but she knew, this time, it was different.They were arguing about whether or not Harry cared about Ginny and the rest of the Weasleys. Or was it that Ron was upset that the mission thus far had been long? Exhausting? Difficult? Utterly defeating? It was ludicrous. They were arguing about everything and nothing at the same time – but none of it was tangible.Hermione tried to step in to calm things down, to bring Ron to the rational conclusion that Harry didn’t mean what Ron seemed to think he did. But Ron seemed determined to mimic the ever-growing storm outside as his face grew redder with rage. Ron exploded again – lashing out at her too this time, her and the fact that her’ parents were safely out of the way’. As if the fact that she had confunded and obliviated her parents that past summer made things easier on her or made the ongoing situation less intense. As if he thought that it somehow excused her from feeling the same worry and anguish that he was clearly feeling, because she now had less to lose in the war. Her chest tightened, and her jaw clenched as she felt the prickle of tears at the corner of her eyes. She didn’t know how to respond. But it didn’t matter because Harry was already screaming back, raising the octave of the tent another level only for Ron to immediately yell once more in retort.
 ‘Then GO!’ roared Harry. ‘Go back to them, pretend you’ve got your spattergroit, and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and–‘ 

 Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own. 

 ‘Protego!’ she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other, all of them were forced backwards a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. 
It was suddenly quiet, despite the noisy raindrops which hit the tent heavily. It felt as though the tent had frozen; time stood still. Hermione could taste
