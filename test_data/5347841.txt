Malfoy wasn't injured by the hippogriff and so the first match of the season went on as planned.  Gryffindor plays Slytherin and they win. Harry retires to the locker room with his team after.
Harry was tired from the match. It had been one of the most fierce games he had ever played.  This was probably due to the fact that it was the first time he faced Malfoy on the pitch this year.  It wasn't until the game began that he fully realized just how important it was to himself for him to win.  And not just for his team.  He felt a real personal NEED to beat Malfoy.  This was only made all the more urgent by Oliver Wood saying "This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup. I'll be leaving at the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it." As the hot shower ran over his tired body in the team locker room, he didn't have the energy to really think about what other emotions his competitive urging had stemmed from. But those would become clear soon.The team had celebrated with the rest of their house mates for a couple of minutes on the pitch before heading into the locker room.  Most showered very quickly and headed back to the castle to join the party in the common room.  Harry knew that it would be going on for a while and he preferred to recharge a bit with a long shower before heading out.  He was a bit sore from the match and thought that a nice hot shower would do him some good.  Harry figured that by lingering behind it would also be an all too rare opportunity for privacy, allowing him to indulge in his new found hobby (the one that most boys discover around his age).  He couldn't shoot yet but the dry orgasms were a feeling he was quickly becoming addicted to.Oliver suspected the reason for Harry's lingering behind but didn't let on.  He'd lingered in the past, and for the same reason, many times himself. As he headed for the door Oliver told Harry to make sure the door was closed firmly behind him when he left. Spells prevented any intruders, but they wouldn't keep out wind and rain if the door blew open.Harry turned off the water shortly after he heard Oliver leave.  He stood naked for a moment in front of the full length mirror on the damp floor just outside the showers, his towel over his shoulder.  The mirror was a very convenient feature of the locker room as it never fogged up, no matter how much steam the showers produced.  This was due to some spell no doubt, Harry thought, as he casually fondled himself.  He made a mental note to ask Oliver if he knew what spell the mirror was enchanted with to make it do that.  He looked himself over and lamented the fact that he had virtually no pubic hair yet around his cock and that it was only about 3 and a half inches when fully hard.  Since he had recently turned 13 he figured, and hoped, that there was probably still some growing left to do there.  A few ultra fine hairs were starting to sprout and, still unbeknownst to Harry, that meant that his orgasms wouldn't be dry for too much longer.He saw that his game uniform was still dirty and in a pile on the floor.  Seeing his team naked a few minutes ago, he was already well on his way to full mast but he decided to deal with the laundry before his wank since he knew that he'd be in no mood after.  So he picked up his wand and cast a cleaning spell on the clothes.  He had wanted to practice a few common household spells anyway (he wouldn't live with the Dursleys forever and wasn't really sure about getting a house elf) and figured this was a good a time as any to try some out.  He gestured with his wand after the cleaning spell was done to float the clothes over to his locker and have them fold themselves neatly inside.  But just as turned to  cast "Alohomora" on his locker to open it he lost his footing slightly on the wet floor and the spell went off in a random direction.  He managed to catch himself without falling but his uniform had dropped to the floor.  So he repeated the process and this time successfully got locker door open and the uniform inside, neatly folded.As he turned back towards the showers to get some soap, the only lube available, he caught his reflection in the mirror and it made him pause.  His reflection had shifted and was now at a slight angle.  On closer inspection he could see that one side of the mirror had come away from the wall a bit.  He pulled on it slightly and the mirror swung out silently on hinges to reveal a secret passage behind.  The door opening spell that went astray a must have hit the mirror, he quickly realized.  This both surprised and intrigued him.  Where did the passage go?  Why was the mirror mounted this way and in this spot?  With the mirror swung open he could now see the back of it and he
