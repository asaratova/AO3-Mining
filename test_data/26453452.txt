Chapter Text
What should’ve been evident from the first day of term — from the moment Draco Malfoy appeared in the Great Hall, late for the feast and visibly disheveled — actually takes her more than a month to riddle out. There was a wildness in his eyes when he sat down to dinner that night, flaring up at the sight of Harry and the freshly broken nose he’d given him. Hermione might’ve noticed if she were accustomed to paying him any attention at all.As it is, she’s not. And it’s only Harry’s dogged obsession with him over the following weeks that gets her to blink and pull Malfoy into focus.Something is very wrong. “What’s wrong is he’s a Death Eater,” Harry says, more than once. Adamant. “He’s one of them.”But it’s more than that. She’s sure of it. Certainly, he’s more withdrawn. Always leaving meals early. Skipping classes once or twice a week. But Harry has no proof beyond what they saw at Borgin and Burkes. No Dark Mark to solidify his suspicions. Malfoy’s sleeves are never rolled up. His wrists, however — they tell another story entirely. Hermione catches a glimpse one morning in Potions. They’re brewing the Draught of Living Death. Attempting to, anyhow. And Malfoy has always been better at cutting his herbs than she is, though she’d never admit it out loud. She glances his way to see how he’s slicing the Valerian Sprigs and instead finds her gaze drawn to bruises.Dark and mottled smears of violet and blue, splashed upon his wrists like he’s dipped them in spoiled wine. They stop just above his pulse point. A sharp cut off. She takes one look and thinks — Lucius.Harry’s not really listening when she tells him this theory; he and Ron are distracted by his prize — Liquid Luck. How he’s managed to lunge from the bottom third of their Potions class to Slughorn’s star pupil, she has no idea.It doesn’t matter anyhow. Her theory proves incorrect less than two weeks later. Malfoy raises a hand in class and the bruises are fresh, color ripe as a plum. They’re more than a month into term. Lucius can’t have done it.She considers self-harm, for a short while. But it seems an ill-fit for Malfoy. And in the end, the answer presents itself by pure coincidence, on a Friday in October.It’s the smell of it. Chemical. Bitter and sharp as a raw edge on metal. Just a hint of it as she passes him at breakfast — but enough to stop her dead, mid-step. There is Wolfsbane in his tea. Hermione does her best to recover herself quickly, the scuff of her shoes on the flagstone apparently not enough to rouse much attention. She manages to make her way to the Gryffindor table and tuck herself in beside Neville, but her eyes are unfocused as she spreads marmalade onto her toast. The scent of aconite is so distinctive — she’s certain she can’t have mistaken it. But to take it in tea. She’s never heard of such a thing, and even for Malfoy it seems like an awfully bold choice. How does he expect to keep it from the other Slytherins? Certainly, some of them will notice —She gives herself a small shake, realizing she’s been scraping a dry knife across the worn-down slice for far too long. How is it this that she’s wondering? Of all things? Of all the other connotations that come with adding Wolfsbane to a cup of Earl Grey like it’s cream?Malfoy is a werewolf. That’s the gist of it. Taking mercy on the toast, she sets it back on the corner of her plate and clears her throat, running a hand through her curls with what she hopes is some measure of subtlety in order to clear her view of him. If she wasn’t sure before, she certainly is now as she watches him drink it. Earl Grey doesn’t typically make one’s face scrunch up that way. Malfoy looks like he’s drinking paint thinner, sharp jaw working overtime just to manage each swallow. How long has he been like this? She thinks it can’t have been going on for more than a few months — wants to believe she would’ve certainly noticed otherwise. Lycanthropy wears on the skin and bones, often visibly affecting one’s appearance. Lupin, for instance. While his condition might not have been immediately clear to the naked eye, he had a frailty about him. A look of illness and exhaustion.Malfoy’s clearly not far enough in to be wearing such side effects—A hand waves in front of her face. Ron. She leans back quickly and diverts her attention to her water goblet. “Yes?”“Said we’re going to Hagrid’s after classes. Are you coming, or do you—”“I have a paper to write.” Ron nods like he heard the words in his head before she said them, but she bites down on the lick of anger she feels because he follows it up with that sweet, disarming smile of his. “I swear, Hermione — one of these days, those books are going to swallow you whole.”“At least then I’ll be surrounded by big words.”Seamus guffaws at that, jabbing Ron in the side with an elbow, but Hermione takes care to smile back at him when she sees t
