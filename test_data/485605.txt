Chapter 1: Creature Inheritance
    


Notes:
It's been 9 years since I've started TBDH and I just want to thank all of my loyal readers who have continued to support me throughout the years. Thank you for reading, commenting and encouraging me, especially on the really bad days. TBDH is one of longer things I've written (The Soula Deveraine Series may end up breaking that wc mark, at the rate I'm going with it. ahem). but it's also a story that I've chosen to leave as is, from when I first started writing. Naturally, I've changed and so has the story, along with some of the themes and tropes that I've either embraced or discarded throughout the years. It makes my day to know that TBDH is a favorite for you guys and I promise to continue to do my best to write and craft it into an amazing epic. Thank you, as always, for reading! ^_^




Chapter Text
The pains started shortly after his birthday.
Harry remembered  staring at the clock and feeling absolutely nothing when the numbers  flickered over to what they ought to be. It had been a horrible day. The  worst birthday yet—and the worst summer he'd spent at the Dursley's so  far. Today hadn't been any exception.
A shudder wracked his body  as he lay on his stomach, fighting to control his breathing in even,  slow draws. He felt completely helpless and dirty.
Everything had  just gone all wrong since he'd returned this year. A tremor wriggled  through him and Harry clenched his teeth together, tight. A sudden wave  of pain washed over him, once, twice and then a third time.
His  thoughts and musings went elsewhere as Harry felt himself slipping. He  only remembered a few precious moments of sanity—and then the real pain  began.
At first, he thought it might drive him mindless, but that  thought flew out the window when he distracted himself by recounting  every single painful incident that had ever happened to him in the  course of the few years he'd been alive.
Well, granted, sixteen years wasn't really a few—but it was the principle of the thing.
Harry  drifted in and out of the painful haze, writhing, twisting and  screaming, though it seemed as if his screams went unheard. No one  came—and no one complained either. Harry felt himself grow weak as his  throat ached and his voice grew hoarse with all the screaming.
The pain was worse than even the Cruciatus curse several times over and Harry could remember that moment all too well.
At  some point, he exhausted himself, physically—there was simply no  strength left within him to lift his limbs and it seemed as if even  thinking hurt his very being. His magic waned and dribbled away and  Harry was helpless to stop it from leaving.
He felt a terrible coldness seep into him and then, a sudden, striking emptiness.
It was gone.
His  mind was too befuddled to properly process that, but it didn't stop  more tears from welling up in his already burning eyes. He snuffled into  the thin sheets of his bed and that was it.
When Harry woke the next morning, the night's events felt like a distant dream.
Attempting  to rouse himself from the awkward position of half-on and half-off the  bed, tangled up in the sheets, Harry discovered just how distant that  particular dream was.
A whimper sounded as he tumbled to the floor  and somehow managed to spring up on shaky hands and knees, when his  body collided painfully with the wooden floor. The sudden movements did  nothing to ease his discomfort and after several moments of careful  shifting, Harry gingerly stretched upwards to his feet.
He made it  about halfway to his bedroom door before the pain grew too much and he  collapsed on the cold, wooden floor and blacked out.
When  Harry woke again, he wasn't sure how much time had passed. He was  relieved to find that his body no longer protested every movement or  thought and doubly happy to note that there was practically no pain left  at all.
He yawned and stretched up from the floor and found  himself making up the bed before the rest of his sleep-fogged mind  caught up to him. It was cold in the room and he wasn't wearing  anything.
A scowl presented itself and Harry rummaged around to  find a new shirt, shorts and pants. He found socks last and slowly put  them on, wondering what had happened to his pajamas during the night.  He'd seen a few small scraps of fabric as he'd made up the bed, but  nothing big enough to verify that it had been his pajamas.
He sighed. An urge to get to the bathroom made itself known and he padded over to the door and tested the knob.
The  locks were open and he pushed the door out, stepping into the hall. It  seemed about midday, if his guess was accurate and Harry made his way to  the bathroom, listening carefully for any sound from the Dursley's.
He heard none.
He  slipped into the bathroom, feeling rather smug with himself and went  about his morning business. He stood in front of the sink, washing his  hands when he finally caught sight of his face.
He wasn't wearing his glasses.
