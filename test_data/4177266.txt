Chapter Text
Harry should have realized that this unfortunate situation was bound to happen since he was as unlucky as one can be (or was it more accurate to say he was the unluckiest person in the entire world? And that was after counting a Dark Lord who was currently clinging to life like a bloody parasite). If he knew about the Felix Felicis, he would have commented how his mother must have drank an insane amount of the opposite of that potion (was there such a thing as 'unlucky' potion?) while he was in her womb. Hell. Considering how much Snape hated him, Harry wouldn't be surprised if the greasy git had actually found a way to administer that kind of potion during his development all because he was the (unborn) spawn of James Potter. But that was a thought he would muse about for another day... ... if he happened to stay alive today, that is. Because, no matter how Gryffindor he supposedly was (in Harry's defense, most of his Gryffindorian acts were due to uncontrolled circumstance brought by his associations with the more Gryffindorian idiots he surrounds himself with), Harry would not intentionally summon his death. "Harry Potter..." Oh, look. His death has greeted him. "Voldemort." Harry nodded slightly as he greeted the man currently smirking at him. Yup. Harry finally done something stupider than that one time he intentionally added laxative on the Dursley's food that one time. "While it is a quite a surprise to see you in this form, nonetheless-" And, Harry had to admit, quite a form that was. Voldemort looked like how Harry imagined Tom Riddle will look like if he was around his middle 30s with his wavy black hair that looked so soft... not to mention neat (Harry internally grumbled about his Potter hair at that thought) and around 6 foot height (Harry was approximating, it's not like he can accurately measure heights without any help). Unlike the blue eyes Tom Riddle had back in the Chambers, he had unnatural red eyes reminding Harry of the blood red roses he grew in Privet Drive. Voldemort (or should he call him Tom?) wore a sleek looking black long sleeved robe that was buttoned up till his neck and parted to the side by his knees. Harry could see black trousers underneath. And he wore no shoes or any kind of footwear. Meh. To each their own, he supposed. Harry would rather not be barefooted to be honest. It seemed... unhygienic. Especially considering he didn't know who cleaned what he was stepping on and when was the last time they cleaned the damn floor. … Did house-elves even clean around here? But he was getting off topic (who knew barefooted would actually make Harry think?) If anybody asked, Harry did not have a death wish. Unfortunately, the fact that Voldemort was right in front of him while he was tired as hell (who knew rituals would suck most of his magical reserves?) in a place only he could access meant that he wasn't going to survive this encounter. And he needed an excuse to stop thinking about the pros and cons of being barefooted... So... what the hell! Might as well finally say whatever the hell he wanted. "You do know there are more colors than black, right?" Harry deadpanned which also sounded a bit tired in his own ear. Unconsciously, one of his eyebrow rose as he said those words. Voldemort actually stared at him with a look that could only be described as surprised. Oh dear... Who knew that commenting about the Dark Lord's clothes would actually stupefy him? If Harry wasn't magically exhausted right now, he would have disarmed or stunned the Dark Lord and ran as fast as he could... Oh well... At least he was able to acquire a memory of stunning the Dark Lord into silence. "You insolent brat." Voldemort sneered, grabbing Harry's own wand from the floor and aiming it towards Harry. Harry stared at the wand, internally musing at his current situation. So this was how he was going to die. At the hands of the Dark Lord using his own wand which he had stupidly left on the floor during the ritual. Wasn't that wand supposed to be loyal to him? Would it be acceptable to say 'Et tu, wand?' in this case? Damn. He should have named his wand. Because, in all honesty, 'Et tu, wand' sounds weird even by Harry's standard. And Harry's 'weird standard' is already skewered. Once more, Harry tried to focus on the fact that he was going to die (and not about barefoot and traitorous wands). Hopefully, he could become a ghost and haunt Voldemort. It would be a riot. Voldemort wouldn't be able to get rid of him and he can annoy his killer as much as he want. Maybe thwart some of his plans if he gets bored enough. If not, hopefully, he could haunt Hogwarts. Oh, how fun that would be. He could sp
