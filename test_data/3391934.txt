Chapter Text
Harry squirmed in his seat. Professor Snape was giving them the details of a DADA practical assignment that would be worth a third of their grade for the year, but it just wasn’t holding his attention like it usually would. DADA was still Harry’s favourite class, despite Snape taking over as professor, and normally this kind of assignment would be right up his alley.But today he couldn’t concentrate.He was itchy, all over, but scratching did nothing to relieve the torment. He felt flushed too, almost feverish, and he wondered if he was coming down with something. He’d felt fine this morning; not even a sniffle. But something… something was odd. Off.He squirmed again.“Harry,” Hermione hissed, out of the corner of her mouth. “Pay attention.”“Sorry,” he whispered back, just a little too loudly. Several students turned to look at him, and he could feel their stares boring into him. Most turned away again almost immediately – but a couple… lingered. Alphas, Harry thought, his face flushing hotter, breath catching in his throat. He wanted to shout at them to stop – stop looking at him, stop undressing him with their eyes, but his mouth was dry. He wanted – he wanted –“Harry,” Hermione said, again.“I know,” he said, clutching at the desk with white-knuckled fingers. “S-Sorry, I –”Her hand was on his, suddenly, and the skin-to-skin contact made him gasp. He jerked backwards, almost tipping his chair over, and stared in surprise at his hand. It felt like she’d branded him. He looked up to find Hermione staring at him with wide-blown eyes, reaching out towards him again in slow motion, as if she couldn't quite control herself.He scrambled to his feet and backed away, heart suddenly hammering in his chest.“Hermione?” Ron said.There was an annoyed voice from the front of the classroom telling him to ‘sit down, Mr Potter, unless you want detention for the next month!’, but he couldn’t make sense of the words. There was a roaring in his ears, and, horribly, he could feel himself starting to harden.In DADA. In class, in front of his friends – in front of all his classmates, and oh sweet Merlin, even Malfoy was looking at him now, and he couldn’t look away from those grey eyes, and he was getting a bloody erection –Panicked, he tried to spin away, only to come face-to-face with Terry Boot. Terry’s pupils were blown wide just like Hermione’s, and as Harry stood, dazed, gaze wandering back to Malfoy despite the clear and present danger in front of him, he touched a fingertip to Harry’s lips.The breath left Harry’s lungs like he’d been sucker-punched, and he gasped, that simple, tiny touch searing him, tearing him open, and still he couldn't look away from Malfoy's burning eyes long enough to –“Get away from him!” Hermione screeched, and shoved Harry behind her as she attacked.Harry stumbled backwards, and suddenly there were arms around his waist, hands wandering into definite no-touching areas, lips on his throat, and he’d only just registered that it was Ernie Macmillan – prefect Ernie Macmillan, always so upright and proper and respectable and straight, with his long-standing Beta girlfriend of three years – when someone else tore him away.There were several infuriated shouts as he was hustled out of the room. Snape locked and barred the door behind them, and he jumped at the sound of thumps. Loud, hard, the door shaking – as if the students (Alphas, he reminded himself; there was no point sugar-coating it) were actually trying to physically batter it down.Alarmed, he tried to struggle out of Snape’s grip. “Don’t – please –”“Stupid boy,” Snape snarled, jerking him closer. “I’m not going to rape you.”“Wh-what?” Harry’s brain spun, horrified at the implication. But, then – even more horrifying, he realised he was still turned on. There was an strange, uncomfortable wetness slipping down his thighs, and his erection hadn’t flagged at all, despite the fear and confusion of the last few minutes. His face burned in embarrassment, and he tried to pull away again. “Let go!”“I’m taking you to the infirmary,” Snape snapped at him. “And if you know what’s good for you, you’ll stop fighting me and come with me quickly.”“Infirmary,” Harry echoed, his body going limp with relief. Snape was practically manhandling him up the hallway, but he felt oddly safe. “What’s happening to me?”Snape made a noise of disgust. “I don’t know why I continue to be surprised by your blatant and frankly dangerous ignorance, Potter. You are in heat, you stupid boy, and had I not been there to intervene, the Alphas in that room would have torn each other apart to claim you. Much longer, and even the Betas would have been roused by your scent. You almost caused a heat-frenzy, Mr Potter.”“I don’t – I don’t –” Harry swallowed, trying to understand through the fog in his mind. Something in him instinctively recognised Snape as safe, but the heat wasn’t diminishing. If anything, it felt like it was getting worse. Like –
