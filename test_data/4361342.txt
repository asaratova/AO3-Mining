Chapter 1: Luna Lovegood
    




Chapter Text
“Thanks for a great evening, Luna.” Harry said sincerely.
He was escorting his date back to her common room after Slughorn's Christmas party. It had turned out to be an entertaining occasion, what with Luna's ramblings about vampires and nargles.
Luna turned to face him with a light smile and absent eyes. “Oh, that's okay. I had quite a nice time as well.”
Harry had been admiring her dress all evening. It looked weird, obviously, covered with glittering stones and colourful feathers, but the more he had looked at it as the party had gone on, the more he had begun to appreciate how it clung to her fifteen year old body. It was short enough that it displayed her long, supple and muscular legs (the results of long walking holidays with her father, Harry assumed) and it clung quite nicely to her developing breasts. But Harry had quickly shaken these thoughts out of his head: Luna was just his friend, and quite a young friend at that.
Suddenly, she stopped next to a broom cupboard door. “This ought to do, don't you think?”
Before Harry could answer, she opened the door and slipped quietly inside. The wizard shrugged his shoulders and followed her; this was hardly the weirdest thing that Luna had ever done, after all.
It was dark and confined inside. Harry could barely stretch his arms out without bumping into something, and yet he could not see Luna through the thick darkness.
Suddenly, he felt a pair of dainty fingers handle the zipper of his trousers. Harry quickly cast a 'lunos' charm in alarm; the room now illuminated, he could see his fifteen year old date for the night kneeling in front of him. Her head was level with the waistline of his trousers, and her fingers still tried to pull down the zipper.
“Luna!” Harry hissed. “What on earth are you doing?”
She looked up at him innocently. “I thought this was what I was supposed to do at the end of the date? That's what the other girls told me.”
The Chosen One furrowed his brow. “What?”
“They told me that you would expect me to finish the date by sucking on your penis.”
Harry looked at her, shocked. Those words just did not seem right coming from Luna Lovegood's innocent, young mouth. But at the same time, he knew that he didn't want her to stop. Harry was a sixteen year old guy at the height of his puberty. Having a girl, and a pretty one at that, on her knees and literally asking to suck his cock had been something that had occupied a fair few of his dreams, recently.
“Well...” Harry contemplated. “Do you want to?”
He hoped she'd say yes.
“I am rather curious, actually.” Luna replied. “I've heard that a man's penis tastes quite like a dirigible plum, though I am rather sceptical myself bec...”
Harry stopped her mid-sentence. He was usually pretty patient with Luna's ramblings, but not when they were delaying his first ever blowjob. Harry was feeling rather slow as he realised that he was finally going to have his first sexual experience, and he didn't quite know what she was doing until he suddenly felt her hands slipping into the waistband of his trousers, to haul them down over his hips and down his legs - then off completely.
He felt her hands slide up his thighs and then she was touching him through his boxer shorts, feeling him out, checking the goods.
A wave of panic rippled over the Chosen One. This was the first time he had ever shown himself to a girl – what if he wasn't big enough? Good enough? 
Shyly, Harry pulled his robes off so that he stood entirely naked, bar his boxers, over the girl who leaned between his legs. It had never even occurred to Harry that he would lose his virginity to Luna Lovegood. She was pretty, definitely, but her innocence and loyalty had always shrouded these assets in Harry's eyes. She was like a sister; like Hermione. She wasn't supposed to be on her knees, touching his cock from his thin boxers.
But he felt himself begin to balloon upwards nonetheless. A tent formed in his underwear, which Luna eyed and handled somewhat curiously.
He was just beginning to get used to her being down there when she took him by surprise yet again by pulling his underwear down as well - leaving him completely exposed and a little vulnerable. It sprang out from its confines and hit her in the eye.
Luna giggled. “It's rather large, isn't it?”
Her hands closed around the base of his shaft, and before he had a chance to look down again and see what she was doing, how she was responding to the appearance of his unconcealed erection - he felt his sensitive staff enveloped by her soft, wet, hot mouth.
Feeling her tongue swirling around his pulsing cock, he couldn't keep a low groan from escaping his mouth, sealing his lips too late for the sound to slip out. He paused - and Luna paused - but there didn't seem to be any obvious signs that there was anybody outside the broom cupboard to hear them.
Luna tied her loose, messy hair back behind her head (while continuing to move her mouth up and down his le
